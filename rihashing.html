Harriers</b></font></p>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">Every Monday evening, at 6:30PM, a group of varying size meets at varying 
locations in and around the state of Rhode Island. There is an air of ritual secrecy about these gatherings. No one knows 
if three or thirty will show up. No one uses a name that bears any relationship to reality. The temperature could be 
sub-zero, or in the 90's. It could be pitch black with freezing rain coating a crusted two-foot snowfall, or sunny and 
pleasantly mild. The reason they meet? To follow a trail marked with flour or toilet paper, led by a pre-appointed "hare". 
The trail is usually through woods and trails, occasionally on streets, but always a challenge, with false trails, loops, 
and natural obstacles such as streams, swamps and briars almost inevitable. They run non-competitively as a "pack". Beer 
usually will be found hidden at one or two points along the way. This is provided at least in part as a reward for 
sticking with the “true” trail. Trails can get, shall we say, "creative". And many will try to short-cut along the 
way.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">There is no one to call in advance. The directions are posted on the 
Internet a few days before the run, and people show up if they want to. New runners (“new boots”, or “virgins”) frequently 
hear of and visit the group. Often after their first run, they are never seen again. [Editor’s Note: That’s why this piece 
has been written. We’re trying for some retention here!] Although the Rhode Island group currently is predominantly male 
(we think), there are usually a few brave (or thick-skinned) women present. Perhaps surprisingly given the general tone 
of these outings, it is rare to see someone under age 25. Mostly they are people in their thirties and forties.  They come 
from all walks of life and professions. About the only thing the regulars have in common is what can only be called an 
obsession with hashing. [Editor's Note: Along with an unnatural obsession with quotation marks, brackets and parentheses.] 
The group is called the Rhode Island Hash House Harriers or RIH3, sometimes referred to as “a drinking club with a running 
problem”.</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="4" face="TimesNewRoman" color="#CC0000"><b>&nbsp;<br>History:</b></font></p>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">Now we know what you're thinking. History! What kinds of wankers think 
one would have any interest in the “history” of what is after all a relatively juvenile and pointless pastime? Well, when 
that policeman is questioning you about what exactly you were doing running through a stream in a nature preserve in the 
rain at 8 o'clock at night shouting and blowing a bugle, it is helpful to have handy some kind of impressive answer. "But 
officer! I am but carrying on the torch for generations of prominent and influential hashers who have gone before me. Did 
you know that Theodore Roosevelt attributed his success at San Juan Hill to lessons learned at the New York Hash? And, 
that George Mallory was lost while setting a hash trail on Everest? Or that the origin of the Washington "Red Dress Run" 
can be traced directly back to J. Edgar Hoover in the 1950's?" Blatant lies are an important skill that can be learned 
through hashing!</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">Hashing is a relatively recent variant of an old English public school 
game originally a “Paperchase”, or 
“Hare and Hounds”.  In the original, a “hare” would be given five or ten minutes “law” (head-start) to run ahead laying 
out “scent” (torn bits of paper) towards a known destination. The pack of "hounds" were obligated to follow the scent 
unless they actually could see the hare in which case they could give free pursuit. False trails, or “checks” were used 
but usually only once or twice, and the run was competitive but without “pots” (awards). The trails were always filled 
with obstacles such as ditches, streams, swamps and fences. The first recognized adult version of this sport, the Thames 
Hares & Hounds Club in London, had their first run in 1868.  Reading the account of the Hare-and-hounds run from “Tom 
Brown’s Schooldays” (Thomas Hughes, 1857) is much like reading an account of a hash today. Except that the write-up is 
grammatical.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">The original Hash House Harriers were founded by a group of British 
expatriates working in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1938. Several of them had run in various groups in Southeast Asia, 
including in paperchase oriented clubs. [Editor's Note: Enough with the history! Move on!] OK, so there are many excellent 
accounts of the history of the "Mother Hash" on the Internet, and we will not endeavor to repeat them. We will however 
cite their original goals:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">To promote physical fitness among our members<br>
To get rid of Sunday’s hangover<br>
To acquire a good thirst and to satisfy it in beer<br>
To persuade the older members that they are not as old as they feel.</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">After World War II, the hash movement very slowly began to spread. 
Beginning in Southeast Asia and Australia, the phenomenon suddenly took off in the 1970's and 1980's until now there are 
over 1500 groups worldwide, the highest number being in the U.S. There are few major cities [Editor's Note: except, 
perhaps Salt Lake City. But can a dry city be called major?] in the United States that don't have at least one hash. 
[Editor's Note: Even Rhode Island has two: the preeminent Rhode Island Hash House Harriers and the Newport Hash House 
Harriers(/Bowling Club/Darts League).] There is no “organization” or structure to these groups. There are no supervising 
or controlling entities. There are no “affiliates”. There are no rules!</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="4" face="TimesNewRoman" color="#CC0000"><b>&nbsp;<br>What is Hashing?</b></font></p>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">Hashing has evolved from "paperchasing". Over time, hashers have defined 
a new "sport" which incorporates elements from many frivolous and inconsequential pastimes into an unusual, mostly 
irrelevant quest without a goal. It is uniquely free from competition, or ill will. There is some variation between hash 
chapters. Some groups are more 'family-friendly", some are more ‘adult’. [Editor’s Note: Read R-rated to NC-17.] Some are 
more socially oriented clubs, some are for serious runners, and some are for singers and rugby players with bad knees. One 
can get a good sense of the character of a hash by reading the accounts posted on the Internet of past runs: the "Hash 
Trash". How much time is spent in these accounts on the description of the actual run as opposed to the description of the 
following festivities can give one a pretty good idea of the priorities of a particular hash. Read the RIH3 Trash and the 
noble character, athletic abilities, and selfless intelligence of the Rhode Island hashers shines through like a beacon to 
the lesser hashes of New England. We are the Albert Schweitzer’s, and the Mother Theresa’s of hashing. [Editor’s Note: 
Many big cities Hash Trash might have a paragraph about the actual run, but then is followed by pages of excruciating 
detail describing the following ceremonies and meal. But they have to run on streets which is pretty boring to do, much 
less read about!]</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">In the RIH3, we are relative purists and follow the fundamentals of 
hashing strictly. These fundamentals include the following:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">1. Hashing is non-competitive. Some hashers are athletes, 
some are couch potatoes, most lie somewhere in between. But finishing first is definitely not the goal (and can result 
in punishment in many hashes).</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">2. Drinking is clearly a part of the hashing culture. Many 
do not drink alcohol, and are still welcomed. But most hashers enjoy beer. At the RIH3, beer is a part of the experience. 
In particular, <b>quality</b> beer is demanded. The unthinking hare that provides a Rhode Island hasher with canned 
American beer is likely to end up wearing it. Some who have thought about joining a hash have been discouraged by what the 
thought of all this drinking. But for most hashers, the typical three to six beers consumed during and after a four to six 
mile run and a meal, over four hours, does not lead to anything near inebriation. And there is no pressure to drink more 
than one wants. [Editor's Note: In fact, at the end of the evening, if you turn your back for a second, your beer will 
undoubtedly be stolen or contaminated with ketchup, pepper, or vinegar.]</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">3. Singing off-color songs is a part of hashing. Many of 
these songs derive from rugby songs, many are recent rewritings of folk songs, and some date from the past as far back as 
pre-Elizabethan England. The history of these songs is particularly fascinating, and… [Editor's Note: Now I don't want to 
say it again. Stop that history stuff!]  While ballads and novelty songs are common, probably the most popular are those 
songs with an easily repeated chorus that all can join in (each in his or her own key, of course) with verses of a common 
theme that can often be added to on the spot by quick thinking poets in the crowd. See the RIH3 songbook for examples.
</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">4. Most groups use Hash Names. Names can run the gamut from 
the inexplicable to the frankly obscene. In the RIH3, names are granted in a very haphazard way, usually after 6-10 
hashes, especially if the recipient has done something memorably stupid.[Editor's Note: It is generally ignored if a 
neophyte asks the origin of someone's name, mostly because either the recipient doesn't remember, or the thought process 
behind the name was so convoluted that it's not worth the breath explaining.] And if one doesn't like the name given, the 
Hash is always happy to change it to a much worse one. Most of us don’t know each others real name even after years of 
running together.</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">5. Tolerance of virtually everything (except perhaps prudery) 
is the norm. New people trying out the hash are welcomed as in no other sport or group. As long as they show a sense of 
humor, and can tolerate some ribbing, and some rude and childish behavior; and if they don’t mind occasionally getting 
wet, muddy, thorn-scratched or covered with poison ivy, they will always be welcomed back.</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<p><font size="4" face="TimesNewRoman" color="#CC0000"><b>&nbsp;<br>Elements of a Rhode Island Hash</b></font></p>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">The members of the Rhode Island Hash House Harriers meet at a location 
described on the “Receding Hareline” every Monday night with the run starting fairly promptly at 6:30 PM. This time was 
modeled by the founders of the RIH3 on the Kuala Lumpur “Mother” Hash. It is observed fairly strictly although it is 
within the discretion of the hare to change to the weekend or to the daytime in cases of Monday holidays. The distances 
are variable, but the average run takes about two hours. Generally, trails are pre-marked with flour, so-called 
“dead-hare” trails. Inopportune rain may send a disgruntled hare out with a fifteen minute head-start to “live-hare”. Most 
trails involve woodland paths, some bushwhacking, and some mud or water obstacles referred to as “shiggy”. Pavement, 
although sometimes a necessary evil, is generally frowned upon. Runners often bring dogs and usually carry something to 
make noises with, such as a whistle or a horn. There are one or two “Beer Checks” per run: areas marked with a “B” with 
beer hidden nearby. The pack gathers at these checks for several reasons, not the least of which is to see how many have 
gotten lost. Inevitably, it is the most experienced hashers who get lost, having wildly exaggerated views of their own 
abilities at shortcutting.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">Marks are on the trail or on trees, rocks etc. In Rhode Island, running 
at 6:30 PM means about seven months of the year the run is at least partly in the dark. During these months a thoughtful 
hare (of which we have none) will liberalize his or her use of flour, and most run with flashlights attached to their 
heads. Most runs are “A-to-A”, or circles of sorts. If a hare sets an “A-to-B”, he or she will be responsible for getting 
the hounds back to their cars at some point, and may provide a “bag car” to bring a change of clothes to the endpoint. The 
basic rules of the trail markings are:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">1. Hounds call out when they see a mark (i.e. a spot of 
flour, or an arrow): “On one!’, “On two!” etc. Whistles, noise makers, animal sounds are encouraged also when encountering 
marks.</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">2. Three marks in a row mean “true trail” and hound will 
shout: “On three! ON ON!”</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">3. That is, unless you encounter an “X” which means “false 
trail”.</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">4. A Circle is a check. Many trails may lead from here, but 
only one is true. (Hashing is just like life itself, isn’t it?)</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">5. There are other symbols (“B”, “BN”, “YBF”, “CB69” etc.) 
which may be explained by the hare at the start. Apart from “B” (Beer Check), mostly these are ignored.</font>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">6. Don’t believe everything you read. There are NO 
rules.</font></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">After the run is completed, and the front running bastards (FRBs) and 
shortcutting bastards (SCBs) are joined by the rest of the pack and the dead-f**king last (DFL), a circle is joined for a 
religious ceremony: the "Down-Down". This ceremony is marked by a lack of piety only exceeded by its lack of solemnity. 
The hare is called into the circle, the run rated and the hare punished with a “down-down”. A down-down is the act of 
chugging a beer (or soda, water, etc. for the non-drinker) and is the only punishment (or reward) used during this 
ceremony. [Editor's Note: On rare occasions in the summer, the one in the circle may be required to sit on a block of ice, 
but this is considered a privilege, not a punishment.] The hare sings a song, and the ceremony moves on. Crimes of the run 
are discussed (such as missing the beer check, assisting a runner in need, mentioning the word: ‘race’, etc.). Miscreants 
are punished, and the worst crime of the evening is awarded the dreaded “hashit”. [Editor's Note: It is forbidden to 
elaborate further about this unspeakable object.] Visitors are brought into the circle and castigated for their poor 
judgment in attending. Virgins are called into the circle, and interrogated by an appointed hasher. They likewise have 
their sanity questioned for deciding to run with the RIH3, and asked to sing. Hopefully, their song will be obscene or at 
least humorous, but if not, anything will do. Jokes are an acceptable alternative. After one run, like it or not, you are 
a hasher. Finally, when everyone is getting sick of the cold or swatting mosquitoes, the closing “religion” is sung and 
the group is invited to move to the on-on-on.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">The on-on-on is basically a meal held at a local bar or pub, or 
occasionally at the hare’s home (if he or she has an accepting family, tolerant neighbors and no small children). Unlike 
most hashes, the RIH3 makes the hare responsible for the cost of the beer etc. on trail, and does not require ‘Hash Cash”. 
The cost of the on-on-on is split evenly by all who participate however, and usually is between $10 and $20 depending upon 
the establishment chosen by the hare. Usually, fine restaurants look askance at groups of sweaty people clad in strange 
t-shirts, singing songs with dubious thematic elements, so the group chooses their venues carefully. [Editor's Note: This 
means we go to dives.] [Author's Note: Alright! I've been good about the history. Why don't YOU shut up, already!] This 
portion of the evening is optional, but it is part of the social experience of hashing and is strongly encouraged. 
Generally, the group disbands between 10 and 11 PM, as most of the RIH3 are desperately in need of beauty sleep (or 
plastic surgery).</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size="3" face="TimesNewRoman">Is hashing for you? If you’ve read this far, you are either a potential 
hasher or you have NO LIFE WHATSOEVER! Every run is an adventure, of sorts. (Sometimes, the directions to the run may be 
an adventure in themselves!) You don’t need to be an athlete. (Take a look at some of the photos of the hashers on the 
website. You’ll agree!) You don’t need to be an alcoholic. (Most of us have bladder-capacity problems and can’t drink that 
much anyways.) You don’t need to be a singer. (Listen to some of the recordings Basket has made recently, if you dare!) 
You don’t need to write sentences with alternating parentheticals. (It helps!) But if you enjoy a challenge, and can laugh 
at yourself and others, you might find that you will look forward to Mondays for the first time in your life. Give it a 
try!</font></blockquote>
