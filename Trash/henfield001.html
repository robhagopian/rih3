  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"><font size="2">Stories of packs of wild
  dogs roaming the London countryside have existed for more than a millennium.
  Roman Legionnaires standing their posts on Hadrian's Wall were mysteriously
  missing, as morning found their posts abandoned. A few scattered bones told
  little of their fate. As we travel through history many tales of devil dogs
  document their prowess in and around the English Countryside. The Werewolf of
  London gave many a heart an increased pulse, and few would cross the moors
  after the moon had risen. Not long ago the Hounds of the Baskervilles made
  their mark not far from whence Sir Snot calls home.

  </font><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">
  <p>It was on just such a night, as the moon crested the trees and cast an
  eerie shadow upon the car park at Henfield Leisure Center, that the Devil Dogs
  of Henfield Hash House Harriers would send fear into the very bowels of this
  quiet village. Thirteen hounds, an omnibus number, gathered under a rising
  full moon. Slowly they arrived in small packs. The first to arrive were <font color="#FF0000">Snot</font>
  and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. They were soon joined by <font color="#FF0000">Bob
  St. George</font>, who would hobble throughout the evening and followed by
  three older but not wiser men: <font color="#FF0000">Martin Knight</font>, who
  knowing the area well would fall victim to a devilish hare, <font color="#FF0000">Mike
  Chapman</font>, caught training early on, and <font color="#FF0000">Graham
  Slade</font>, a mountainous man, whose steps found the deepest marks in the
  shiggy. Also there was <font color="#FF0000">Edward Black </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Tot
  Peirson</font>, who disappointingly following their friend <font color="#FF0000">Lloyd</font>,
  thought safety would be gathered by close friendship to the co-hare. <font color="#FF0000">Dave
  Lowrie</font> hid in the shadows and others there hid in darker shadows yet.
  Fearful that their presence would be given <font color="#FF0000">Jackie</font>,
  a very buxom woman, who could handle a beer engine as well as a good stiffie,
  with <font color="#FF0000">Dog Meat </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Mrs. Snot</font>
  lending not their feet upon the dreaded moors this evening, but would pay the
  price later.</p>
  <p>And so we begin.</p>
  <p>The Hare explain that with Anthrax being grave concern, blood was added to
  flour, and a red blotch would be left along lane and field for all to follow.
  Six thirty gave the horn a sound and all followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
  across a ball field to a row of stinging nettles. A check was found, and many
  traveled east and west. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> jumped strait
  across said nettles, and found his landing was not of solid ground. A second
  footing saved life and limb, as a deep gorge had been hid by the hare therein.
  Torches were lit and peering down inside was seen water streaming through old
  bones left to rot. The flesh was washed downstream to Brighton and eventually
  out across the Channel to France, but that is for a later story.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> heading the pack was soon outfoxed by
  the hare and went in the wrong direction, which was to be the norm for this
  evening. The pack went through Parsonage Farm through a corn field onto
  another check where <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>found a stream and
  decided to clean his shoes all on his own.</p>
  <p>A river was soon encountered, and questions of whether to swim or not,
  crossed the minds of a few. The choice of having to swim the murky water and
  clean shite from ones legs, or stand waiting for the hare was being pondered,
  as a &quot;B&quot; was seen on the ground. Searching nearby a bag of ale was
  found and opened, and all shared its bounty. Songs of lost cocks and
  lobstermen filled the eerie darkness, as the beer was consumed. Smiles
  returned again to solemn faces, wracked with pain earlier from nettles and
  thorn, and the distance being greater than expected. Once the beer had been
  finished, the pack moved onward.</p>
  <p>Following the river, a footbridge was crossed, but finding no blood flour
  there, was re-crossed by all, save the snickering hare and <font color="#FF0000">Mike
  Chapman</font>, who knew it was a dead end trail. The pack continued up stream
  until fences were found. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>traveled over the
  first and second, and continued along the river, until he heard the pack going
  left between the two. As he traversed the pasture further, he found the mud
  and river joining into ever-deeper muck, until all but his higher being was
  not covered by it.</p>
  <font size="2">
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Snot </font>called out to show the way through the
  hedgerow. Crawling under an electric fence, through nettles again, and into a
  hollowed indentation that lasted a quarter mile. Traveling was even slower
  here, as a stagnant stream brought ferment from the fields. One had to either
  run bowlegged at water's edge, or through the center, where foot deep mud
  sucked mightily at shoes. <font color="#FF0000">Bob St.George</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Martin
  Knight</font> were&nbsp;just saying,&nbsp;&quot;this must have been how it was
  in the trenches of 1914&quot;, when <font color="#FF0000">Graham Slade</font>
  came splashing through like a crazed German tank covering their backs with
  things your mother told you not to put into your mouth. Many slipped here, and
  cursing the hare was not an unusual sound along this lane.</p>
  <p>Those traveling left found trail and called the pack onward over a fence
  sty, and into a field from whence many a cow had left it’s mark. Having
  rained the previous fortnight, the ground was soften and the droppings of the
  cows swollen and fresh. This left all with ankle to knee deep shiggy with
  which to travel, and made for slow going. Another fence and crossing rounded a
  pack of cows, which showed their displeasure of interrupting whatever they had
  been doing in that darkness. Moos sounded, as they moved ever closer to see
  what sounded horn and whistle. A slight decline into a deeper mulch cause most
  to caution, but <font color="#FF0000">Snot</font> found himself much like his
  wife 9 months prior to <font color="#FF0000">Lloyd's</font> birth, as his feet
  were far overhead. Landing soundly, his cursing gave rise for the cows to move
  off to quieter ground, and the pack continued even more cautiously.</p>
  <p>A road was crossed and an eagle/chicken split was found. Those of greater
  stamina followed eagle and those feeling strain of the trails length, followed
  the chicken. <font color="#FF0000">Tot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Edward
  </font>stood by<font color="#FF0000"> Lloyd</font> in hopes of finding their
  way out without too much exertion, but received little help, as all became
  lost. Soon two fields were encounter, with steps over fence to find a check.
  Traveling right led to only darkness, but to right flour led to another beer
  stop. Here, the eagles enjoyed an example of hash blend ale and much singing.
  The chickens had been duped by the hare, and did not join the pack until most
  of the beer was finished. Telling by their faces, splattered by muck, a story
  was told of their disastrous choice of trail, with shiggy not yet seen by all.</p>

  </font>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With beer finished the pack made their way back along the very same trail
  the chickens crossed, and eventually out to streets which led back to the
  carpark. Inside the Leisure Center showers were enjoyed by all, and flesh was
  seen upon legs scratched and swollen from the evenings events. Upstairs a bar
  was found with many ales and stouts. <font color="#FF0000">Jackie</font> our
  barmaid for the evening’s event hung upon our every word as she pulled pint
  after pint, until an Alowetta allowed us to honor her. Her breasts were as big
  as <font color="#FF0000">Lloyd’s</font> chest, but softer with pointed
  projections that could knock out eyes. She did her down-down graciously, but
  dribbling upon her shirt allowing <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>to suck
  up the liquid. She grabbed his head, and it was lost for sometime between its
  folds.</p>
  <p>Down-downs were give to the hare and co-hare, virgins, and visitors. Since
  none knew different nor protested, <font color="#FF0000">Snot</font> named
  himself Grandmaster, which won him the first hashit. It was fashioned from a
  WC plunger, aptly inscribed with the H4 insignia. When finishing the first
  beer from within, it was stuck upon his head and worn with great pride and
  jubilation. A phone rang across the circle and finding Graham speaking upon
  it, the hashit found its second victim. <font color="#FF0000">Lloyd </font>was
  named <font color="#FF0000">Rumpole Foreskin</font>. The ladies were brought
  into center for their obsession with dry feet. <font color="#FF0000">David
  Lowrie</font> drank even though he claimed to have run most of the trail, but
  never saw a single check.</p>

  <p>The songbook was brought out, and many new songs were joined by all, until
  the food was served. Curried beef and rice was devoured along with many
  pitchers of ale, and such jocularity as has not been seen in this sleepy dell
  since King Arthur returning from the crusades grabbed<font color="#FF0000">
  Mrs. Snot’</font>s ancestor and had his way with her. As the evening waned,
  many promised to return, but finding most leaving their soiled sneakers in the
  dustbin, questions about their honesty were voiced. All returned home safely,
  and the village returned to the quiet still it had before the evenings event,
  yet fearful of the next full moon’s rising.</p>
