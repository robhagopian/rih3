<p>I know, I know! I really, really wanted to hare. I even planned to have three mystery co-hares do all the work. But I 
have my patients to think about and all those guys I met <i>yesterday</i> at speed dating, as well as concerts and happy 
hours and things. I don’t have a minute for myself these days, what with <i>every little thing</i>. Anyways, since <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was sweet enough to hare for me, the least I can do is write it up. He decided to set in 
Smithfield (probably because it’s named after me!) and really did a swell job. <i>I feel fine</i>. I of course, would have 
had a more organized theme, party favors, and numerous virgins along. I mean, 40 years to the day after Ed Sullivan hosted 
the Beatles, that’s worth a celebration! (By the way, who is this Ed Sullivan guy anyways? Was he like the Carson Daly of 
the 60’s?) But<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> does the best he can. <i>Let it be</i>.</p>

<p>The mighty wankers of the RIH3 gathered at a parking lot on the Farnum Pike in Esmond. Actually, it was more like a 
skating rink from the freeze-thaw cycles we have been having. I personally would have gone with an Ice Capades concept at 
this point, but whatever. At six-thirty, they were off. First up, a real teaser: in the woods for a minute, then across 
the Woonasquatucket River southeast onto the road. <i>Tell me why</i>? (There was going to be a lot of road on this one, 
but there’s nothing wrong with that. Kind of an “Abbey Road” theme, if you think about it. You guys are always complaining 
about road, but don’t shin splints count as shiggy?) <i>I’ll cry instead</i>.</p>

<p>Next up: a check mark that had <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> heading into a 
factory area where a rude and irate security guard started after them saying “Stop <i>what you’re doing</i>! Get the F**k 
outtahere!” &nbsp;What a wank! Doesn’t he know the hash has priority, even in Esmond? The hare had to calm him down. 
Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> found trail climbing up an embankment 
of boulders east off the Farnum Pike. They finally got into the woods. About time, too, I say!&nbsp; The <i>magical mystery 
tour</i> led north; and between the footprints and the flour, the poor hare couldn’t even lose <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font>! I certainly would have done better. Not that I’m ungrateful or anything.&nbsp; But you know, he could have 
marked trail with some sort of guitar-shaped marks or <i>yellow submarine</i>s or some cutouts from a Beatles mag or 
something. Like a <i>paperback writer</i>.</p>

<p>Guess what? <i>Do</i> <i>you want to know a secret?</i> They ended up back on the road. Fenwood Road to be precise, 
leading up to Whipple Road and some playing fields. They were back in the woods briefly, and came to Georgiaville Pond. 
Now you could have had a nice skate here, maybe with a boom-box and some Beatles tunes. And <i>Maxwell’s silver hammer</i>, 
of course. I think we’d get a lot more virgins if we combined dancing with hashing.  That’s it! Next time I hare, I’m 
throwing a sock-hop at the Beer Check! And it’ll be a Sadie Hawkins type also, you can bet. After all, <i>I am the walrus.
</i></p>

<p>Well, they turned around a bit back on roads and crossed the river on Stillwater Road. Most ran straight by it at first, 
but the Beer Check was to the left. Good work, hare! You fooled some of them for once!  <i>Not a second time</i>. The beer 
was hidden behind a slum property that the hare owns in a cute little yard with a swing and frozen dog poop all over the 
place. They sang some Beatles songs, with words I can’t reprint here for decorum’s sake (although, being a medical 
professional, I do know <u>most</u> of them). But, <i>hey, Jude</i>! <i>I don’t want to spoil the party</i>. A few beers 
and a few anecdotes later, they realized that there was no one around who hadn’t heard these anecdotes before. It gets old 
after a while. They decided to head back, and found a brief circle of a trail through someone’s yard, curving back to 
Stillwater, uphill to an old RR grade that paralleled the Farnum Pike southeast back to the cars. <i>Imagine</i>.</p>

<p>They circled in the woods above the cars. The hare was yet again recipient of the hashes beneficence and because he 
stepped up to the plate for me, AND with no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, AND with lots of ice, he was given a 0.69 
total. Hashit was given in turn to everyone. (Although no one thought to give it to me who really deserved it, tee-hee! 
But <i>I’ll be back.</i>) It ended up with <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, as seems to be the new trend. <i>Help</i>! 
Apparently, when he thought the proceedings were over, he made a suggestion. It wasn’t a bad thought really, to limit the 
membership of the RIH3 to 150 hashers. But I mean when the weather gets good, we’re gonna take off, I just know it. But he 
should have known better, and waited for the On On On. Which by the way, was back at Swampy’s. Still no pickled eggs, but 
a fine collection of Beatles and 60’s tunes on the jukebox. A great time was had by all, and next time I’m hare it’ll be 
even better. I might even get <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, that wanker, to be my cohare! It’s been a <i>hard day’s 
night</i>, so:</p>
