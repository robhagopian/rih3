<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> was still pissed off.&nbsp; He was convinced we engineered his gift of Raging Brew 
at the Xmas Hash.&nbsp; After two weeks of Genesee Light, <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> was beginning to show early 
signs of Ragingdom....including a sudden fondness for light American beer and cross dressing survivalists from Connecticut.
&nbsp; So, on Monday night, he decided to exact revenge upon the hash by laying a marathon shiggyfest through the frozen 
tundra (redundant?) of Smithfield.</p>

<p>By 6:15 Monday night, the aforementioned <font color="#FF0000">Who</font> was waiting in the parking lot for 
someone...anyone... to show up.&nbsp; Concerned about the potential threat to its citizenry, two Smithfield police cruisers 
kept a watchful eye upon the hash sawbones.&nbsp; After a few minutes, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> pulled up in his 
macho man Camry (<i>note:&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> does not believe the recent newspaper article describing 
the average Camry buyer as a 53-year old woman!</i>).&nbsp; At about 6:25, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> showed up with glassy-eyed looks from spending the previous half hour in the intimate airless 
lounge at Swampy's Bar and Grill.</p>

<p>At 6:31:04 P.M., after a lame set of mumbled hash d'rections and&nbsp; excuses about snow obscuring marks, the forlorn 
three hounds followed the hare behind the strip mall and up into the woods.&nbsp; Heading out onto the dark power line in 
the freshly fallen snow, the trail skirted the perimeter of Smithfield Crossing, (another charming collection of big-box 
stores set into former shiggy after a sweetheart deal made between developers and greedy small-town selectmen).</p>

<p>The trail meandered through the woods, across swollen icy brooks, through the wetlands and generally north along the 
powerline.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async, Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> took advantage of every 
opportunity to leave <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> behind in the woods, but the tenacious ex-Marine followed 
footprints through the snow to keep up with the pack.</p>

<p>After heading north along the powerline for about two miles, the trail made a U-turn through the woods to the south.
&nbsp; A short wooded jaunt later, the four hashers emerged into the old quarry along Route 5.&nbsp; Ben and Jake soon 
sniffed out the beer, and we enjoyed porter near the romantic waterfall in the center of the quarry.&nbsp; Shivering in 
the dark, the hashers set out further up into the quarry.&nbsp; Upon reaching the edge of the woods at the top of the 
quarry, we heard distant whistles and cries of &quot;On-On!&quot;.&nbsp; After a few minutes, distant headlamps were 
spotted heading towards us at a leisurely pace.&nbsp; It was <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
EverReady</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp; (It seems that our very own <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> had foolishly said 
&quot;yes&quot; to <font color="#FF0000">KNO's</font> entreaties a&nbsp; few days before.&nbsp; Yes, the poor young lady 
is planning the &quot;M&quot; word).&nbsp;&nbsp; Seizing an opportunity to spend one last time alone with the hash 
terrorist, <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> sought his counsel in the deep dark woods.&nbsp; They didn't seem to be any hurry to catch up with the pack.</p>

<p>After an impromptu second beer check, the shivering wet pack headed back up to the powerline for the run back to the 
start.&nbsp;&nbsp; The circle was held behind an apartment complex behind the Apple Valley Mall.&nbsp;&nbsp; The usual 
ministrations were administered by religious adviser <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crimes, real 
and imagined, were identified and the innocent punished.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> received Hashit 
honors for reasons forgotten.</p>

<p>The cold wet group repaired to the parking lot of Swampy's to change into warm, dry clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few tipsy 
patrons emerging from the bar were a little startled by the sight of a naked <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> writhing 
around in the back of his truck with dogs...but we reassured them the Boddhavista was simply getting ready to go inside.
</p>

<p>All in all, <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> succeeded in thoroughly punishing the hash for that damn case of Genny 
Light.&nbsp;&nbsp; Raging would have been proud.</p>
