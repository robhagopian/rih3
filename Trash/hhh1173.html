<p><font color="#0000ff">Hare:</font>  Justin My Ass<br><br><font color="#0000ff">Location:</font>  Rhode Island College, North Providence.</p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">Weather:</font>  Clear, low 70's.</p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">Present:</font>   <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Dr

  <br><br><font color="#0000ff">The 
Run:<br> </font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">No one could 
actually believe that <font color="#ff0000">JIMA</font> would actually set a 
trail. They were unpleasantly surprised. Starting from the tennis courts at the 
north end of Rhode Island College, the hare met the small group, just before 
6:30. They were off a few minutes early. <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> 
had not yet arrived, and they wanted to be sure to miss him.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail led west 
through the campus. The group was studiously ignored by the student population. 
<font color="#ff0000">Flobanger</font> found true trail heading out and south on 
Fruit Hill Ave. There were a few neighborhood detours at checks, but basically 
trail continued down to Manton Ave., and went west to the bike path. A falsie 
led to a crossing of the Manton Pond Dam. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> were first across, and at the “X” were 
successfully able to lure <font color="#ff0000">Flobanger</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Just Meghan</font> across. 
<font color="#ff0000">Just Meghan</font> took her shoes off for the crossing to 
stay dry. She put them back on, standing right next to the false mark. The 
concept of a false trail was explained. She took her shoes off again to cross 
back. I don’t think she quite gets it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail continued 
northwest to the end of the bike path. It entered a neighborhood, and the marks 
were fairly sparse. It was getting dark, but not dark enough for the flashlights 
to be effective. Finally, trail and the hare were found entering a vacant lot at 
the end of Irons Ave. It was the beer check. The beer was brought out. A few 
songs were sung. The hare then tried to convince everyone that the trail 
continued on the other side of the Woonasquatucket River. Just a short swim. 
Yeah, right. <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> tried out the water, but it was too scummy and deep for 
a 25 meter swim after dark. It was also clear that the hare hadn’t tried this 
before, either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They all wisely 
decided to return the way they had come. More or less. <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> got on the wrong side of a fence in the factory on 
the south side of Irons. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Flobanger</font> tried a 
shortcut by crossing the dam. These didn’t work out too well. <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Just Meghan</font> simply backtracked and were first in, except of 
course, for <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>. They had to listen to his tales 
of shiggy on the golf course, lies about mileage and no pavement, etc. All back 
finally, and, after <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> tore her pants climbing 
the fence into the children’s playground, the hare announced that they would 
circle up in the woods at the rock <a href="hhh998.html">(previously used in Run #998) </a> at the east end 
of campus. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They drove over. 
Making their way into the woods to the rock, <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> 
and <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> proved yet again that there are no limits 
to human stupidity, as they got lost on the wrong side of a fence from the rock. 
Ha, ha! The run was rated. Apart from the almost inconceivable circumstance of 
<font color="#ff0000">JIMA</font> actually setting a trail, the very conceivable 
absence of <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>, and the almost inevitable 
circumstance of <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> getting lost, there were no 
positive comments. ALL PAVEMENT. No more needs to be said. Total: -69! Hashit 
went to <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> for tearing her pants without 
actually exposing any body parts. <font color="#ff0000">Just Meghan</font> was 
punished for showing up again. Finally, they headed out for the On On On at the 
Abbey on Admiral St. where there is a good selection of beer, and the food 
missiles and inappropriate songs were kept to a minimum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
