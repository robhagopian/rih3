<font color="#0000FF">Commemorating:</font> Everywhere, all around the globe, Hashes were being hared by harriettes to 
celebrate the 3/3/03 date. One might wonder what that has to do with Harriettes, or Hashing for that matter, so I’m gonna’ 
hafta’ tell ya’.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Way back when G, Horse, Cecil,&nbsp; 
and Torch started this whole thing, there were no women. Well, no round eyes 
anyway. And it pretty much was that way until way past World War I, when that 
bloody mess stopped a good thing and Hashing took a back seat to trench warfare.</p>

<p>The Hash House Harriers were 
founded in a moment of post-prandial inspiration, at the Selangor Club Chambers; 
about 1937/38, by the inmates, who included Cecil Lee,&nbsp; E.J. Galvin, Malay Mail, 
H.M. Doig (H&amp;C - killed in an air crash just before the Japanese War) and A.S. 
Gispert of Evatt &amp; Co. Gispert was the real founder - a man of great wit and 
charm, who was killed only just returned from leave in Australia to rejoin the 
Volunteers. He was a splendid fellow, and would be happy to know the Harriers 
are still going strong, and is as merry and bright as ever - or more so.</p>

<p>Gispert was not an athlete, and 
stress was laid as much on the subsequent refreshment etc. as on the pure and 
austere running. It was non-competitive, and abounded in slow-packs. Life was 
then conservative rather than competitive. This is something lost upon some of 
our new hasher who think running miles along hot tarmac is fun. Consideration 
should be made to send these blockheads back to Hashing School. Shall I name 
Flaming Queen for the first trainee?</p>

<p>The name was a mock allusion to 
the institution that housed and fed us. Later, Torch Bennett returned from 
leave, and produced order out of chaos - a bank account, balance sheet, and some 
system. But we prided ourselves on being rather disorganized - or the minimum 
organization sufficed. The original joint masters were Cecil and &quot;Horse&quot; 
Thompson, still running somewhere - a past-master at short-cuts and the 
conservation of energy.</p>

<p>Celebrations were held in 
various places, and the first was in what is now the Legislative Council, then 
the Volunteer Mess. The oratory was much the same as now. Lew Davidson is an old 
member. Morris Edgar was one, but apart from Lew and John Wyatt-Smith I do not 
think there ware any more ante-diluvians still running. Philip Wickens was also 
one who kept us going post-war.</p>

<p>Hashing started up again after 
the War due to Torch Bennett who discovered a Bank Balance and put in a claim 
for War Damage on one tin bath, and two dozen mugs, and possibly two old bags 
(not members). We started by a small run in reduced circumstances round the 
race-course - then the horses were not much better.</p>

<p>The Emergency cramped our style 
but did not diminish our activities, and we were even called in for information 
on various by-ways in Selangor, but our period of usefulness to MI 5 was brief, 
and our information probably otiose. But the hares ran into two bandits at 
Cheras, who were later copped.</p>

<p>An Irish Accountant, Kennedy, 
drew up the Rules when we had to register as a Club, and he seems to have 
preserved the old traditions just as you do now.</p>

<p>Now these were all men clubs, 
where a beer and a short run was all that was required, but after some time, the 
more virile would stray from the circle one of the local ladies houses. After 
some time, the circle was getting kind of sparse. Then it was thought that the 
light fragrance of perfume would not be so bad, plus the price of a go in town 
was getting somewhat dear, so it was decided to invite the fairer sex to the Hash.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before there were 
more skirts than you could shake a stick at. It was like a smorgasbord, and you 
didn’t find too many complainers. It was March 3, 1953, when one of the ladies 
volunteered to Hare. The number three was significant (HHH) and the anniversary 
of that first haring was celebrated down through the years. This year’s multiple 
3’s make for a grand global event, that was followed around the world.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">The Good 
Doctor</font> volunteered for Rhode Island and garnished the help of
<font color="#FF0000">the Bad Doctor</font>, who when dressed up in a light 
frock, ain’t that bad on the eyes. The weather cooperated, with temperature in 
the teens and plenty of snow on the ground, it was a perfect night to hash.</p>

<p>We started at the Selangor 
School for Wayward Ladies off East Avenue in Pawtucket. Bondo, with Jake and Ben 
were last to arrive, and joined <font color="#FF0000">Basket, WHO, SMP, WIPOS, 
Oozing, SESYB</font>, and Seamus just as the pack was spiriting around the 
school. The trail followed streets and led to a break in the fence, along an 
open sewer line and across the river to Down Town (dead town) Pawtucket. A 
couple of good checks allowed <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>to make his way 
to the front of the pack. Being uncomfortable in this position, he quickly found 
his place at the rear, and continued his banter about effen snow, effen cold, 
and effen hare.</p>

<p>Alley ways and parking lots led 
out to Pawtucket Memorial Hospital, around the Paw Sox ball field, through some 
tough neighborhoods and back to the river along the power lines. Beer was 
eventually found overlooking a mound of stinking fish, where Ben just had a 
rolling good time. Latecumer <font color="#FF0000">Fawangii Boner</font>, joined 
us and we had a long discussion about where this strange odor came from. Stench 
or not, we had beer and much singing and jubilation ensued.</p>

<p>Beers done, we were back on 
trail and straightaway to the start, where we circled on an icy slop.
<font color="#FF0000">Boner </font>was first to find himself on his back, as he 
raced downhill without caution. The remainder of the pack inched downhill to the 
celebration. Hares got Down-downed, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> got 
Hashit, Latecumers and Ladies drank as we sang their songs, a voice across the 
ball field told us in no uncertain terms to SHUT UP!</p>

<p>We adjourned to the East Street Café for much needed food and drink. Condoms were 
supplied in keeping with the Bimbo Theme, so <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Boner</font> displayed their new application, while 
entertaining the natives. Good Hash and more bimbo’s was agreed by all.</p>
