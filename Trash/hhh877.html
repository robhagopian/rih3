<font color="#0000FF">Present: </font>‘Frozen’ Bondo Jovi, ‘Alpine’ Basket Boom Boom, Oozing ‘Ice Covered’ SD,

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the traditional start time 
neared, the hare found himself alone at the start wondering where the other 
wankers (OK, nutcases) were and mulled over the Hash of One write-up.&nbsp; Giving up 
on the hoped for mental deficiencies of the rest of the hash and thinking of all 
that cold beer in the back of the hash truck our stalwart hare started home.&nbsp; 
Nearly a mile down the road were spotted two Abominable Snowmen and their 
hounds!&nbsp; Wait, no, it was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi </font>and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>.&nbsp; Seems they missed the start 
somehow.&nbsp; One may suggest having <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> navigate 
could account for this.&nbsp; But I digress….</font></font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">While enticing these hashers with tales of trail and 
beer who but <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Seven 
Year ‘itch </font>drove up.&nbsp; After an amazing display of Connecticut going 
forward in reverse driving the pack assembled at the start.&nbsp; Our Pakistani 
friend then impressed the women and old men of the hash into digging a path out 
of the snow covered parking area whilst a much bewildered snow plow driver 
looked on in amazement at the hash preparing to hazard the wonderfully crisp, 
snow laden air in pursuit of beer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hare gave d’erections to look for 
the yellow snow.. er, flour or the rectangular yellow marks so carefully placed 
on trees.&nbsp; Bondo and Basket</span><span style="font-size:
10.0pt"> sported their most fashionable snowshoes and snow poles.&nbsp; Seems they 
have found <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS’</font> favorite boutique!&nbsp; With cries of 
ON ON and the beginning of the F ratings from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>
the pack followed FRB <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> into the wilds of
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Western Connecticut.&nbsp; Here the hare, 
suffering from a short bout of common sense, faded back and brought the beer to 
a foreshortened end of trail/beer check.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack was relocated just short of 
the beer truck that was boldly emblazoned with ‘Budweiser, King of Beers’.&nbsp; 
Where would a Queen be without his King?&nbsp; First located were
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font></span><span style="font-size:
10.0pt"> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> who both commented on the 
wonderfully large amounts of white powder.&nbsp; Who would have thought a trail could 
be over-marked?&nbsp; Crawling up to the top of the hill were <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo, </font></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 
and the mismanagement.&nbsp; Who knows what happened on trail but
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font></span><span style="font-size:
10.0pt"> was beside himself as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had bent his 
pole.&nbsp; This falls squarely within the bounds of ‘Don’t ask, Don’t tell’.&nbsp; After 
a short slog through the </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Hemlock Forest 
and over rocky hills covered in two feet of snow the beer truck was reached.&nbsp; 
Taking a Russianesque trek through the winter wonderland that is Rockville is 
thirsty work.&nbsp; Alas, the pack was sorely disappointed to find only Long Trail 
suds and not a Bud in sight.&nbsp; Songs were sung and ice began to form in 
unmentionable places prompting the hash to load up the beer truck Beverly 
Hillbilly’s style and cranium back to the start.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circle formed and the hare was 
given his just reward for a superbly laid trail with appropriate weather to 
boot.&nbsp; Due to the half-minds being frozen and snow blind the circle closed with 
no hashit awarding or religion.&nbsp; The hash then sought cold beer in a warm pub.&nbsp; 
Praying that the Wood River Inn would be open the three-vehicle caravan started 
North.&nbsp; There was no room at the Inn for the frozen hashers but
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> cousin had ensured that warmth and cold 
Guinness awaited the hash even if no fries were available.&nbsp; Firmly ensconced 
beneath a sign reading ‘Welcome All Grand Stretchers of the Truth’ the hash 
broke bread (and wind.. Bondo) and showed <font color="#FF0000">Just Erica</font>, 
the stranded in Rockville Baltimore hasher wannabe, just what hard-core hashing 
is all about!</p>
