<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Only a few were 
hardy (dumb) enough to make it to the Connecticut border for the virgin 
solo-haring of <FONT color=#ff0000>Florence Wallbanger</FONT> at the familiar 
location of Beach Pond in Arcadia. (Speaking of retarded, a car full of Boston 
wanks led by <FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> himself and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Pick Wrung Guy</FONT> tried and failed to find the site. Ha, ha!) 
The early arrivals waited a few minutes too long; tempting fate. But there was 
no sign of <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, so they took off with great 
rejoicing. But they were premature. A few minutes after they entered the woods, 
the worst happened: <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> arrived.<?xml:namespace

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail led out 
along the Deep Pond Path (Tippecansett Trail) briefly southeast. A marked 
bushwhack to the pond shores was pretty obviously unnecessary. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> would be dumb enough to follow this kind of thing! 
Trail paralleled the pond for a while, and then took off east through the woods. 
There was not much running to be done, but at least there were a few bog 
crossings. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> led for the most part, followed 
alternately by <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The trail curved 
north and uphill. <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> frequently had to stop and 
carry his dog. At least this gave him some sort of exercise. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> by now was with the group, although the leaders were 
confused as <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo </FONT>had made a bugle out of a piece of 
his home still, and Basket was only carrying a whistle. The checks were sparse, 
and so was the flour. Progress was slow on the bushwhacks, but even with 
frequent calls of “Last Mark!”, <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> were able to find the beer stop by 7:15. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> of course, immediately called “False Trail!” <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> WAS COMPASSIONATE AND CALLED “Beer Check!” TO <FONT 
color=#ff0000>BASKET</FONT> AND AS YOU WILL SOON FIND OUT WAS <B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><U>NOT</U></B> GIVEN HASHIT FOR THIS 
HEINOUS AND ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY AND VERY NATURE ITSELF!, 
if you’ll pardon a little editorializing.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The beer was 
easily found, and all were present. Except the hare. Lost sweeping his own 
trail! (He naturally denied this, but <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO’s</FONT> kidding 
whom!) Luckily, he hadn’t troubled to hide the beer very well. He finally 
arrived. A variety of beer was shared, along with some dried fruit and M&amp;M 
trail mixes. What is this, a granola-crunching wilderness group? No one new to 
impress, and no bimbos to scandalize so there wasn’t much in the way of singing. 
Ah, winter! The return of the all gay RIH3.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail back led 
south and west. The main trail was soon reached, and with little effort, the 
group returned to the cars. The circle was formed on the shore of Deep Pond. 
Ratings included: slight shiggy, short trail, good beer, and an unaccountable 6F 
rating from <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. It was only the news that the 
Boston crowd had driven all the way down only to get lost and miss the whole 
thing that saved it for the hare. Total: +0. Hashit was given to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Dr WHO</FONT>, because they had plenty of time for a long song (No 
other reason seems possible.) Finishing up, they moved on to the Black 
River&nbsp;Inn, where they were well-behaved and quiet. 
Pathetic!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
