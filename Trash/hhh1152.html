RIH3. Next time, don’t do us any favors. Recent rains had affected his plans to 
some degree, but since when does a Rhody hare have anything resembling “plans”? 
So no big deal. The start was from the Oakhill Tavern. The hare gave 
instructions to turn left on Rt. 1, and left again on Haverhill, then straight 
to the end. “You should find some marks by then” he said. 
Hah!</font></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></O:P></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font color="#000000">The small pack headed out. As usual, trail led to the shores of 
Belleville Pond and deviated as always, northwest to the old trolley bed. The 
visitors from Boston were amazed as <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> seemed to always make the right choices. This is not 
often seen. <font color="#ff0000">Async</font> led, but plowed on straight, while 
<font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and the visitors followed <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> out to Ten Rod Rd. on Warburton. But now, things 
became confused. <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> tried west, <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> crossed the car dealership looking for marks in 
Cocumscussoc. <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> tried east, but 
gave up too soon.<br>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font color="#000000">Finally, someone (<font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font>?) noticed the hare, 
sitting on a front porch a quarter mile east on Ten Rod. He gave the pack 
instructions to head into the woods northwards. Because of the rain, he had set 
using yellow ribbons. He said go straight, turn right “in a while”, and leave 
the houses to the left. But he mentioned that there mightn’t be too many marks. 
Apparently, just before the hash started, he had run into an angry property 
owner, collecting yellow ribbons. (Must be the brother of the guy who’s always 
chasing us out of the woods at the east side of Cocumscussoc. What’s with these 
people in Wickford? I mean, Tinker’s been gone for a few years. Do they have 
memories like elephants, or what?)<br>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font color="#000000">North they headed, into a nicely briar-filled marsh. <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Mr Rogers</font> turned left 
and surprisingly, found a yellow ribbon. But this was the last they would see. 
They came to an actual path, <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> tried north, 
<font color="#ff0000">Hare Club</font> south. No ribbons. But <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> found… an angry property owner, collecting yellow 
ribbons. He was very unhelpful, and didn’t seem to find the sport of hashing to 
his liking. He went off to call the FBI. Lucky <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> wasn’t there, or Homeland Security would have 
road-blocked all of North Kingstown.<br>

shiggy, they came out onto Rt 1, said unanimously: “F@#&amp; the hare!”, and 
turned south on Rt 1 back to the Oakhill Tavern. No beer check? No problem! In 
they went and started a tab for the hare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>It is 
actually a nice, warm feeling, sitting in a comfortable bar having a beer, 
knowing that the hare is sitting on his cooler out there in the woods waiting 
for you to arrive. But eventually, even our hares catch on. He joined the group, 
and they gathered out in the parking lot to circle.<br>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font color="#000000">Ratings for the run: Nice shiggy, 30% virgin territory (for a good 
reason), no <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>, and a hare foiled by both weather 
and homeowner made up for the lack of a beer check. Total: +0.069! Hashit: <font color="#ff0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>, yet again for good 
and valid reasons lost in the mists of time. Back inside, they had their Steak 
Fry, and sang a few songs for the appreciative clientele (the usual bartender 
having decided to take Monday nights off for some reason). As the evening ended, 
all agreed that it’s a good thing that Pig Iron (whatever), NH is more than 
three hours away.</font></span></FONT></p>
