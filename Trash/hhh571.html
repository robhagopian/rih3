<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This run was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing

turn out included </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and yours truly, which if my mathematics serves me is three. &nbsp;We were
all issued shirts for this run, by the way if any of you missing bastards
want one, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
told me to tell you its going to cost! Your scribe felt at quite a disadvantage
against these two gazelles, but as you will read brain outwits brawn again.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The run set off from a downtown city park and
I would just like to say at this juncture what good directions we had.
After waiting a few minutes for any latecomers we set off up hill which
was the theme of this run, “Up and Up the road” Your scribe decided that
it was time to match </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s
previous record of going up eighteen falsies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very quickly,
I was at the back in my normal position after taking the very first two
false trails.&nbsp; Every single bloody check went up hill! With the run
soon taking us to the top of Hope and Thayer, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">seemed to tie in to every lone jogger which
in both cases were female, the second one however had very little up top
and I am not talking about brains readers. Nothing to hang onto whilst
scratching your head if you get my drift. &nbsp;&nbsp;But this did not
deter </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">who
can detect pussy from 69 paces. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Brown fraternities were quite perplexed at
the site of three runners going down the heart of this university district
blowing whistles and making farting noises out of a horn, with questions
of “What are you doing?” &nbsp;&nbsp;Hey guys, if this is your bright future,
the future is not looking too bright in America, unless we bumped into
all the ‘E’ grade students all one time.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was at this point your scribe struck out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> had gone
right at the check.&nbsp;&nbsp; I continued straight on.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
some obscure reason ,we did not run through the female campussy, but sensing
the first beer stop was near I peeled off in the direction of the pubs
and stumbled across flour marks and could not believe my luck when they
led to a bar. &nbsp;I was of course first there by far and this lucky intelligent
short cut had me drinking the amber nectar long before the two gazelles
showed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact I went back outside this drinking establishment
to double check I was in the right place, shortly thereafter the shouts
whistles and farts of the RIH3 were heard outside, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> were
convinced I was lost, they were quite surprised to see me at the bar supping
ale-Suckers!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The beer stop was a welcome stop from the concrete
pound. Soon after the downing of a pitcher the band of three were off on
the on in. A new first for the RIH3 was to take place this fine evening,
as we came across a TOBY refreshment area but some of us recognize as TCBY
(The Country’s Best Yogurt). Without hesitation your scribe was convinced
the flour marks went inside this establishment, once inside we were compelled
to buy three vanilla yogurts. This time people thought it most strange
that three runners dressed in similar attire would run up and down the
road whilst consuming yogurt! History in the making, I told you guys my
handle should have been Mr. Ice-cream. The trail from this point was fairly
straight forward with the checks getting more obvious, with your scribe
now starting to outrun </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
now that the yogurt was kicking into the muscles, my shortcutting paid
off yet again as the other two slow bastards caught up to me by the vehicles.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The circle up was held in what used to be a shelter
with new trainers celebration completed by the GM and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
&nbsp;&nbsp;Marks for the run was 6.9x 10-7 due to the absence of shiggy.
The on-on was back at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozings </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">house
where Sartre was the delicacy of the day followed by ice-cream rinsed down
with some fine ale, a fine run missed by many. Good job </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
who also collected the Hashshit award again! On-On</FONT></P>
