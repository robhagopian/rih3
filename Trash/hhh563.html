and got his St. Patrick’s day clover marking equipment ready to start the
live hare run. A whole three minutes was given before the pack set off

had drawn a clover leaf but forgotten to cut it out, hence no bloody flour.
The pack found its way onto the main road going up and down hunting for
a sign of hare, as usual the hare had outwitted himself and ended up calling
the pack on through some greenery onto more pavement the rest of this part
led us through suburban territory to the Attleboro train station. All present
with a few minutes to spare before the arrival of our train some good old
grog to celebrate St. Patrick’s day. A few concerned voices inquiring if
tickets were needed, to which the response was-”what tickets”. The arrival
of our ride had us all jump on with many eyes inquiring if we had all escaped
from the local nut house. Very soon Mr. Inspector confronted us, fortunately
he was of Irish descent and upon hearing the voice of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
thought he was at home cracking jokes, what also helped was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
dressing up in the spirit of the day, a bowler hat with a clover drawn
on (five leaves was a bit of a give away). The next station- Attleboro
South was soon upon us and we all got off under the watchful eye of Mr.
Inspector and a fond farewell. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The second part of the run was a long haul in,
with shiggy lots of road running the unavoidable water crossing albeit
small was cold and would you believe wet! The pack was well spread out
and the hare had indicated a short cut for some of the slower runners including

and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Blue Balls</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#400080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In
truth, the SCB's including Oozing were in fact the dynamic missing links

including a confrontation with a Park Ranger finally led us to the beer,

which by the way he failed! That is why he became a Psychologist so he
could explain his direction with meaning. The circle up was carried out
back at the start due to the presence of Mr. Plod with ratings for the
run ranging from minus 17 to plus 0.3 the high marks being awarded for
the train ride. Hashshit award going to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">

all Irish pubs being crowded out on this particular evening we ended up
at a local watering hole with Guinness, corned beef and cabbage being the
order of the day.</FONT></P>
