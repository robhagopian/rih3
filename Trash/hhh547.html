<P>Instead of Batman and Robin it was Snotman and Hopeless, yet again a
poor turnout for what was run of the year at Carrs Pond Road in East Greenwich
with your trusty scribe playing Hare and Hopeless the only fox. Basket
giving some half baked excuse about a relative showing up for Thanksgiving
and our Rusty friend from Newport failed also to show due to corrosion
of the gray cells. No mention of Little Neck who has been missing a number
of runs recently, we hope you are still managing those five miles or two
in your case, you really should come more frequently! </P>

<P>The run took one and a half hours and the attendees decided to co-hare
a similar route in the area for a summer bash, so not all was lost. A comfortable
night with the temperature in the high forties, unusual for this time of
year. The on off was called at 6.40pm just in case somebody showed up late.
The first check with Beyond Hope, hopelessly lost which was the start of
more to come, on trail with Hopeless taking the next check correctly for
a long run through narrow trail having to watch out for marks carefully
in the near pitch black conditions down towards shiggy, the left through
water was quickly rejected by Hopeless for the drier alternative but was
found to be a falsie, the correct trail being through shiggy, but Hopeless
took an exceptional detour to avoid getting his plates of meat wet, which
he managed. On up then down towards running water, through a number of
tricky long falsies most of which caught Hopeless. </P>

<P>The second water crossing had a slippery narrow log precariously balanced
across its length, but Hopeless knowing that was the only way across decide
to cut through thorns and get cut to ribbons trying out a number of different
alternatives before coming back to the log, like a high wire trapeze artist
and although it took Hopeless a full five minutes to cross the water he
somehow managed to stay dry, I am sure Basket would have pushed him in
at this point but we will have to wait six months to find out. On up through
more shiggy avoided by Hopeless to the beer stop which included some of
Baskets favorite beer. From the beer stop Hopeless took two other checks
in the wrong direction before getting back. The moon had decided to break
out from behind the cloud cover and the back end of the run could just
be run without flashlights. Down Downs were held at my pad, with the (false)
Hashshit award going to Basket with the Down Down being accepted on his
behalf by Hopeless. Marks for the run were high with the main complaint
being, not enough water, but the way Hopeless negotiates water we could
have been in the area all night if we had to cross any more water or shiggy.
Songs were sung in the true Hash tradition finishing as usual with swing
low. </P>

<P>The on-on was traditional hot (very) chicken curry made by our live
in maid-Jacquie, the only problem being we have had curry every night since
and up to Thanksgiving. I guess that’s what happens when you cook for ten
and only two show, its a good job I love my old lady’s curry.</P>
