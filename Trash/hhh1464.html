I don't remember starting from this side of the forest, but Bondo disagreed, so it must be so. The turn-out parking area was small and the Hare suggested that additional parking would be found  
further down Copicut Rd. The trail started out along a path heading easterly and into a forest of tall pines. A good check had us fooled for a while, allowing late cummers Donkey and Pubic to  
catch up with the pack. We found flour going south then turning westerly, crossing the road, into a large sandpit. We ran up and down the piles of sand, along mountain bike trails and eventually  
found the Beer Stop near the road. There was absolutely no shiggy, water of any sort and a boring slog through a pleasant forest. Slowly but surely, the pack arrived and we all enjoyed some IPA in  
WHO jugs, hot nuts and yellow food. <br/><br/>
A car drove by slowly twice and then a third time. We wondered if it may be a local looking for beer or concerned about a pack up kids drinking in their back yard. WIPOS arrived last just as it  
made its last pass and he said it was some old guy, probably looking for a house. The street did not have many, so he must have been really lost or interested in us. The beer was finished and we  
started out the short distance back to the cars. A circe was formed in the woods nearby and the Hare got a DD for setting a shitty trail. The rating was a high negative .069 and should have been  
lower. Too much pavement, not enough shiggy. Amish received the Hashit for bringing Heath on such a shitty run. We then traveled to Jillian's Pub for more beer and food. Then we went home.<br/>
That's all I got.<br/>
