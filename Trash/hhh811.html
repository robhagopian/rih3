<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF"><i>The Run:</i></font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">This run was one of the most imaginative, degrading
hashes of the year filled with trail, road, and shiggy.&nbsp; The night started
out with whining and crying because the trail had been set less than 5 miles
from<font color="#FF0000"> Async's </font>and<font color="#FF0000"> Eveready's</font>
homes in Borrington and they had not even made an appearance. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
was so distraught that he and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> walked out to the
golf course to have a moment alone, and when they disappeared and re-appeared
out of breath with <font color="#FF0000">Basket's'</font>shorts ripped, a
re-naming had taken place, guess who is now <font color="#FF0000">Misses Enema
Bill</font>.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">The night of trail blazing continued through
Seekonk, never setting foot into Rhode Island (isn't this the RIH3???), and
along the trail <font color="#FF0000">Misses Enema Bill</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill</font>, Baxter and Zoe were seen holding hands and keeping in step with one
another.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> even saw them sitting
together (the 4 of them) writing poetry alongside the dam......?&nbsp; We are
not sure if it was poetry or of they were writing a note to the police cars that
had been following them all evening....<font color="#FF0000">Misses Enema Bill </font>was
very afraid.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">The beer check was so gratefully found by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
alongside the toxic swamp, he had expertly followed the pink flour/chalk trail
marks. Zoe was so out of breath from all the action on trail she started
drinking the toxic water which was extremely helpful since she led the way back
to the on on; her body glowing throughout the night. At the beer check, the hare
finally arrived after catching the Harry Potter movie at The Showcase theatre,
he then sang one of his best ballads and serenaded <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill </font>&amp; <font color="#FF0000">Mrs. Enema Bill</font>.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> looked on through the glowing toxic air
and continued to sing alongside with <font color="#FF0000">Dr. Who</font>.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">At the circle, sniffles were being heard because
still no <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font>.
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was FRB and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Oozin</font>g tried to rate the run but because there
were no bankers in the crowd, they could not do the math to figure out the
correct numbers, so once again the weeping continued.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
started to sing some songs in Pakistani, another ballad, and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
was trying to throw rocks to hit his house, he kept saying we were close to his
home.<br>
<br>
The night seemed to be a wash, the crying, the whining all the way to the onon
when all of a sudden, who do they see walking into the bar, her wrap skirt
unwrapping, her smile so bright, but <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font> and
she had brought friends, Brittany Spears and Norman Bates. <font color="#FF0000">Misses
Enema Bill </font>had, of course, already left the building, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>was so excited to meet Brittany that his shorts ripped all the way down
his leg, exposing himself and opening himself up to his&nbsp; idol, Brittany.&nbsp;
Brittany was amused and continued to arch her back to show off the special half
shirt that Norman Bates had picked out for her to wear this evening, bought especially
for her at the local KMart. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was trying to
get Torts to open up the karaoke machine so he could sing with Brittany, Oops I
did it again, he sang, but they would not oblige, so once again, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> were left on the sidelines as <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>was seen in the corner trying to figure out Brittanys' date of
birth.(counting with his fingers)</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Back to the cars the hashers ran, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> so jealous that <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>had received so much attention that they decided to hunt down <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
and create a disturbance in the country club plat of the little town of
Borrington. Borrington will never be the same, pissing in front yards,
disturbing the peaceful neighborhoods, driving through the little streets with
high beams and flashlights and Baxter relieving himself on all the trash cans
placed for the local trash pickup the next morning.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">In accordance with the romance of the evening, all
hashers had to end the night at a home full of pussy(cats). <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
left Borrington after Oreo stroked him for half an hour, <font color="#FF0000">Basket,
WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> finally left after eating
the last of the homemade cookies...and snacking on plenty of nuts. </font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">A glorious, romantic, intriguing, night was had by
all on this week of Thanksgiving.........</font>
