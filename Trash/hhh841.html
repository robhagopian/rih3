<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Poor (sunny, low 70s)<br>

<p><font color="#0000ff">The Run</font>:</p>
<p>Sad but true. I've been trying to come out for some time now, and I've finally pulled my balls up, hoisted my skirt, 
and I'm going to do it. Rhode Island has been my salvation. I've been hiding behind my father's skirt for too long. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, you are such a huge example for the rest of us, that I will be forever grateful.<br><br>

I wanted to join you guys on this hash. I shave my legs, armpits, bought new panties, and had my hair pouffed, but in the 
end I just could do it. Now I'm so ashamed. But it made me realize I can't hide behind trees anymore.<br><br>

I watched you guys gather on Brown Ave., and after a short while, you were all scampering along merrily into Snake Den 
Park. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was on his bike without a seat, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were leading a small, but cute, pack of guys into the woods and down through the rocks. A 
really big guy, who I heard later was a visitor called <font color="#FF0000">LOAF</font>, ran just behind a girl.  What 
she was doing there was anybody's guess. She was kinda cute in a feminine way, and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> 
was showing her the RIH3 markings. Someone called her Kristen. I much prefer that big boy, but I'm sure he would have 
never even cast an eye in my direction. The last to show was <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>. No one expected him back 
after <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's </font>Hash across from Diamond Hill.  <font color="#FF0000">PW </font>was lost in 
the swamp with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing,</font> and promised him anything to stay with him as the setting sun caused 
shadows to blanket every mark left by the hare.<br><br>

He really is pathetic. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, that is. Leaving poor <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> out in 
the dark like that. I'm glad it wasn't me.<br><br>

The perfectly formed butt of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led all down to a small brook. He crossed over the brook 
and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> was just behind. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>went straight, and would 
not be seen until the Beer stop. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led the pack of dogs and hashers, including the biker, 
up and down the cliffs where not long ago <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had his winter beer stop complete with fire 
to warm our frozen fingers. It was so comforting, and the heat on my bottom gave rise to my front. I had to sneak off and 
get off when no one was looking.<br><br>

The pack meandered up and down the cliffs for a good 20 minutes until they saw the &quot;No Beer Stop&quot; sign. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> started his usual vulgar vocalizing of his idea of a good run, while the rest continue on. 
They made there way out to the power lines, and searching for flour there, saw <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>at the 
bottom of the hill, standing in water up to his knees. All must of thought it was one of <font color="#FF0000">
Basket's </font>things he always does, when he call up and told them to look further uphill. Flour was found, but it only 
led to a 'False Trail' marking, the sneaky bastard.<br><br>

When the pack neared, he called out &quot;On Beer&quot; and we could see <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> standing 
beside him, both drinking our favorite beverage. From my vantage point, I could see it was Guinness, and I was more than 
a little disappointed in myself for not jumping out and getting a cold one for myself. I guess I'd rather eat crow later, 
than swallow my pride now, or is it eat and swallow something else, whatever, I didn't have the balls.<br><br>

They were there a short while, drinking and singing, when <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready Smelly Beaver 9</font> ran out 
of the woods with <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>. Her hair was all disheveled and her shirt was on backward. I guess 
she must have dressed quickly after work, and had <font color="#FF0000">KNO </font>pick her up. They live near each 
other, I guess. Finally the last to show was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  Complaining that he carried his bike up 
and down that cliff 6 times and didn't believe the sign about no beer. Boy did the &quot;F's&quot; start flying, 
especially when he reached into the cooler and found the cupboard bare. Luckily he reached into <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> Celtic shorts, where he found the last Guinness. That shut him up for a short while.<br>

<br>When the beer was finished, all had to make there way back across that putrid standing water to the trails that led 
back to the cars. They circled up off the roadway, and the hare got a down-down, along with the visitors. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>got the Hashit, and the pack sang some great songs. I wish I had the balls to join them. 
They all left together, went into Swampy's for food and beer. Maybe I'll join them next week.</p>

<p>On On,</p>
