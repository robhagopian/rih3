<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was a beautiful sunny day that I could see
forever as many gathered for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font> hash...the
fornicating RI 769 hash (too many hashers to name), as we set off up and down
hill and valleys following beautiful trail dodging all the butterflies and
tropical fruit hanging ripely off the trees when suddenly...yours truly scribe
wakes up!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hash was set a day prior with the assistance
of a ghost hasher without checking mundane things like the weather, with bright
white flour and colourful chalk...well by midday Monday, I realized not for the
1st time that I was fucked!&nbsp; It was befitting that a run starting from a
place called India Point that another natural calamity would hit!&nbsp; Yes and
I apologize for not starting at Cady's for the 3rd time in four weeks!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As I returned from resetting half the trail in
coloured flour with the idea of live haring...I waited until 626pm with not a
soul in sight...by this time hands/feet were numb with pain...from snow to hail
then freezing rain...finally <font color="#FF0000">Wipos</font>, then <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>and close to 650pm <font color="#FF0000">BasketBB </font>(only 1 day post
op with his docs blessing and looking a million pounds) show up...and to think I
was going to give up on the wanks...well we haven't missed a run for over 7
years now! Needless to say as my fingers were close to self-amputating I wasn't
going to take them on the punishing trail that was set with absentee <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
in mind...so we took a leisurely stroll to the Portugese bar that was
closed...and ran to Olive's instead now quite wet and cold, had a beer, ran
back, circled up in record time to let the ploughman do his job...back to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font>
for beer and Biryani that seemed to take forever to cook in fact twice as long
as the wet and shitty run that he set!&nbsp; Apart from the weather nothing
positive to report on this run...remind me next time never to set trail again!&nbsp;
And may the nation not have to depend on its pansy navy men!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ON ON.</font></p>
