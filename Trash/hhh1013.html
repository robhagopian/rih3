<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The rain was falling so hard that I-95 turned into a flowing river, unable to drain the torrent of accumulating water.  
Rush hour traffic slowed to a harmonic crawl.  It was already past 6 p.m. when <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Sparky</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Naughty</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Molly</font>, and I (<font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>) departed Providence, all stuffed in my car.  With so much body weight, I didn’t know if I 
could get everyone there on time.  I was seriously thinking of dumping <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font>, or <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, or better yet, both.  That way, I could get there quicker and retain the two bimbos as 
well.  It was unecessary, unfortunately, because with my finely-honed Michael Schumacher-like driving skills, I got the 
five-some to the hash with time to spare.  How pathetic.</p>

<p>As we arrived, the rained stopped.  Nevertheless, the rain-soaked forests and fields of the northern part of the Big 
River Management Area made for prime hashing conditions.  The dampness in the air and dark clouds looked as if another 
rainstorm could hit.  Excellent!  I sensed everyone was in high spirits.</p>

<p>For the second week in a row I noticed <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> at the hash.  His boss must have still been 
out of town.  As though I cared.  The newbies <font color="#FF0000">Great at Giving Head</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Just Nathaniel</font> arrived, seemingly becoming RIH3 regulars, suggesting to me that they have no life.  Cool, I was not 
alone.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brought both Ben and <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> to the hash.  I began to 
wonder if <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> needed <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> so that he wasn’t always slowest on 
trail.  Regardless, <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> was still faster than <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  And of 
course, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived with his better half Seamus.</p>

<p>And with that, we departed the fields off Fish Hill Rd. (just off Harkney Hill Rd.) into the northwest corner of the 
management area.  We followed an arrow pointing west and crossing Fish Hill Rd. and onto a dirt road.  With many marks 
washed away, mass confusion ensued  -- nothing unusual, however.  I just stayed away from <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>.  Far, far away.  At a check, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> searched north, <font color="#FF0000">Sparky
</font> went west, and I looked south.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> sounded his horn beckoning all to follow.  
Something smelled funny, and this time it wasn’t <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> went south after special instructions by the hare.  I should have followed them.  
Yet since I was the scribe for this week, I felt it my sorry duty to stick with the pack.  In retrospect, the run would 
have been much more exciting had I gone with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font>.  
C’est la vie.</p>

<p>You’d think they’d learn!  You would think that THEY would learn!!  That was all I kept telling myself as I watched 
them, like a pack of doomed mindless lemmings, following <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> into a long falsie.  Even the 
veteran <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> took the bait.  Confused, <font color="#FF0000">Just Molly</font> started to 
show worried expressions, as this was only her second hash, and worse, the first with the Rhodies.  If I were not a 
hasher, I would have felt sorry for her.  True trail then headed west through wet fields of tall grass.  I wished they 
were briars.  Ahhh, nothing could have been better than fresh blood on trail!</p>

<p>Trail bent southward led by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>.  The rest of us 
caught them as they reached a small tributary of the Big River.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> didn’t think the mud 
was THAT deep.  After he reached thigh-deep in the wonderful-smelling black mud, he began to think otherwise.  With 
several shoes lost in the thick muck, I joined the others who (but not <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>) decided to look 
for an easier crossing.  Nobody went unscathed.  And <font color="#FF0000">Just Molly</font> began questioning her 
friendship with <font color="#FF0000">Naughty</font>.  Sadly, the two didn’t partake in a physical struggle… in the mud.  
I digress, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Trail dumped out on Fish Hill Rd. and led westward by the hare re-marking the washed away flour.  All I had to do is 
follow the hare.  Pathetic.  Others weren’t so observant.  Even more pathetic.  Then something so freakish happened that 
I could only have thought it a miracle.  Despite numerous checks, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> the FRB managed to 
guess each and every one of the checks correctly!  Divine intervention?  Nah.  It was just Seamus making all the decisions 
this time.  After all, there is nothing divine about <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  Intervention on the other 
hand…</p>

<p>I soon noticed <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> growing worried, and rightly so, as he followed <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> so closely.  And I never saw <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> so happy (is that guy NEVER 
happy?), as he was enjoying the best view of the hash – right behind <font color="#FF0000">Just Molly</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Naughty</font>.  Lucky Bastard.  Then I noticed <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> grimace at <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">Aync</font> must have seen the new guy as personal competition in 
athletic ability, good looks, and propensity to attract bimbos.  Neither truly had much to worry about.  There was no 
alpha male in this pathetic group.  I continued to run, keeping my thoughts to myself.</p>

<p>Still the FRB, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led us suckers southward and close to I-95 and then in a long 
off-trail clock-wise circle jerk.  I spotted the hare short-cutting the circle-jerk and bringing the DFLs in tow.  We 
reached another check next to Big River, and everyone followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, once again.  I decided 
that <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> luck would run out, so I headed northward and quickly came across a “B”.  
Nobody followed me, thankfully.  Not wanting to share any of the beer, I repeatedly hollered “false trail!” to anyone 
following.  I managed to fooled <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font>, not once, but twice!  After all, “BN” on trail could 
have so many different meanings.  Right?</p>

<p>Despite my futile attempts at finding the well-hidden beer and after five minutes of fighting off the other hashers, 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> eventually arrived and brought the others quickly 
to the beer check.  Sh*t!  I was so looking forward to a nice quiet beer check without these wankers.  Nevertheless, 
Dogfish Head IPA and Chicory Stout were opened and savored.  Even with special instructions from the hare, <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> were missing.  Brilliant!  And it must have been a hint 
by the hare, as a bag of Smartfood was included.  Not even Smartfood could have helped this sorry group.  Nevertheless, 
<font color="#FF0000">Naughty</font> even with a graduate degree tried mightily to add a bunch of smarts.  Um, hashing… 
smart… hashing… smart… oxymoron.  Ugh, I should have found that beer before the others arrived.  Not even I am perfect, I 
suppose.  *Sigh*</p>

<p>For reasons beyond reason, upon leaving the beer check, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> decided to take over as the 
hare, using toilet paper to mark trail east and northeast back to Fish Hill Rd. where <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> sat waiting in the darkness, both sharing five gallons of Bondo-brew.  Then the hare 
(the real hare) took off to fetch his car and the beer for the circle.  The rest of us waited.</p>

<p>Circle was held and comments started with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> launching into “Jesus Saves”.  If I were 
Jesus, I’d open up the thunderclouds and zap this circle into oblivion.  We’re all going to hell anyway, so why drag it 
out?  Weren’t we already in Purgatory (run <a href="hhh1008.html">#1008</a>)?  Guess not even the devil likes us.  Can’t 
blame him (or her).  I digress.  The others kissed up mightily to the hare.  It was excruciating to watch.  I concluded 
that the hare must have put something into the beer.  After all, he is a doctor and has access to who knows what?  And 
yes, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> does know what.  Regardless, the total seemed to average the mathematical 
impossibility of <b>-0.6.9</b>!  Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, for bringing <font color="#FF0000">Jake
</font> and making him suffer (not so much from the physical exertion but to be in the presence of us).  <font \
color="#FF0000">Just Molly</font> was rightfully punished for showing up at an RIH3 hash, and <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Nathaniel</font> was christened into RIH3 by being named <font color="#FF0000">Amish It Head</font>.  Being the super-nice 
guy that he is, he did not put up much of a fight, thus suggesting a renaming in the future.  But I digress, again.</p>

<p>Anyway, we moseyed onto Marks down the road.  Nobody had to worry about Exit 6 not 6A this time.  I encouraged all to 
order the scallop roll, but only <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> got the message about this culinary delight.  
Pitchers of IPA and Guinness… blah, blah, blah.  Even <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> joined us this time.  Too bad 
<font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> couldn’t join us too.  He was more deserving.</p>

<p>Speaking of deserving, I really felt undeserving to the task of writing this week’s hash trash -- my ten months of 
hashing versus <font color="#FF0000">Jake’s</font> ten years.  Yet we all can take comfort in knowing that <font 
color="#FF0000">Jake</font> will be in a much better place, and in a way I, for one, am both grateful and jealous, as I am 
doomed to hash with all you wankers for many years to come.  And with that…</p>
