Run:<br> </font><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">In an effort to 
be creative, and just before the first Sunday of Advent, the hare decided to set 
a Christmas Shopping hash starting in the Warwick Mall. He even provided Santa 
hats for all. I believe he had fallen asleep with his radio on, tuned to one of 
those all-Xmas-Music-since-October 1 stations, and it had damaged his brain. But 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> knows. It was a dark and cold night for the last 
Monday of autumn, and only a few were stupid enough to actually 
show.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The start was 
from the east side of the mall. It began southwards; with marks placed over the 
fence in some very dense shiggy. You’d have to be pretty dense to actually go 
into this shiggy. So <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Scatwoman</FONT> qualified. The 
rest followed along, giggling outside the fence. A second turn over the fence 
was more convincing though. It led to a wider point of land and some 
garbage-strewn paths. This time, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> wasn’t biting, 
and he continued up to an apartment complex. He found himself with <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT>, re-emerging into the mall, this time heading 
northwest.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The marks were 
indiscernible, but the hare showed up and encouraged them. The pack caught up, 
after the trail was followed across Bald Hill Rd and back in the woods behind a 
restaurant. There were good opportunities for shiggy here, but no. While <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> were looking for a 
culvert or something good, the rest continued north. They came to a crossing of 
the Meshanticut Brook. <FONT color=#ff0000>Scatwoman</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> were seen on the other side. The hare said that it 
was true trail. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> said “I’ll do it, if the hare 
does.” The hare crossed the brook, chest-high. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> is 
a liar! He went around with <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT><FONT 
color=#000000> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT>.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail was 
quickly found on the west side of 295, turning south on a bike path. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> blew through a check and found himself in a 
homeless tent city. Finding no good porno mags, he turned back. He found the 
rest at the beer check, underneath a well-lit billboard. He also found a fence. 
By walking into it. Finally, <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> has some 
competition for Hashit. The beer was shared, and a few short songs sung. But 
there is little inspiration to be had in a smelly, garbage-filled vacant lot 
under a too-bright billboard advertising airport parking or something. So they 
were on back.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">There was no 
trail back to speak of, so they backtracked to West Natick, ran across Bald Hill 
to the mall. <FONT color=#ff0000>Scatwoman</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> tried a 
shortcut through the mall, the rest beelined through the parking lot. The circle 
was held in the woods next to the river. Ratings for the run: pavement, 
pavement, pavement! But the hare being fooled into an unnecessary river crossing 
on his own trail? Priceless! Total: +0.69! Hashit of course went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>, mainly for not sustaining serious injury walking 
into the fence. Finishing up, they moved on to the Ball Sports Pub on Rt 5. And 
that’s where it ended.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
