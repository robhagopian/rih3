It was the best of times; it was the worst of times. Another year down the toilet,  and visions of trails to cum  reflecting in my glass of beer. Where were you Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Crotch Tiger, Ass Quack, Crabby Shag, Fuwngii, WeeBalls, Flo Banger.  Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!  On, Comet! On, Cupid! OnOn Donner and Blitzen!<br><br>

Despite the pack being a bit thin, the percentage of bimbos to wankers was impressive. 8 dicks to 10 tits are a gladsome sight at any Hash, but being the last of the year, in deep snow with so much woman meat was like being at an open house at the Ardbeg Distillery in Islay.<br><br>

Parking was a little questionable, with the amount of new snow, in the small un-plowed parking lot on Hopkins Hill Rd. But only Amish, in the White Wale, showed any signs of trouble. Just a little more gas and a push from the crowd had the wale beached and the pack ready to go. <br><br>

Oozing, Basket, Hairy and Luxury Box chose to use the long skinny boards, while the rest chose to run in shiggy shoes and boots. The skiers had to quickly decide to either scratch across the street at the start of take them off. Most did the former, I didn't and it put my arse in the back of the pack quickly.<br><br>

The trail took a clockwise direction along well worn tracks, with some interesting hilly terrain and one pretty good downhill sprint, that ended back on Hopkins Hill and a crossing at Tarbox. True trail went uphill while a few foot prints and most of the skiis followed the lake trail. All soon met again at a beaver dam with a delicate crossing along the top. The beer was soon found at the height of land above previous bonfire/beer stops, and soon singing and imbibing began. <br><br>

The visitors were impressed with our repertoire, especially the 'welcome bimbo' song, Pubic Hairs, sung to the cutie Bitsy Rider. Last to arrive was Dog Meat and Oozing. What they were up to was anyone's guess, but they were certainly thirsty on arriving and helped us empty the beer jugs. <br><br>

Back on skis, we started down the steep hill, between boulders and crossing the stream at the bottom, where someone conveniently laid a pair of boards to carry feet and skis across. Then uphill to the parking lot and the circle. Amish showed a bit of his chivalry as he carried Dog Meat up the last bit of the hill, when she said she'd like to get a ride from him. <br><br>

The Hare received his DownDown for a job well done. The visitors were invited in, with shouts of 'show us your tits', and Bitsy Rider was just about the oblige when interrupted by Pussy Galore, once again. Why she hasn't gotten the Hashit for it is a wonder. Others received DD's for various offenses and finally Hashit going to Shemale for being even more obnoxious then usual. <br><br>
Half the pack went home, while the rest found good food and drink at Rosie's / Mark's / JC's. The last Hash of the year was a good time enjoyed by all and New Years wishes that we finally see the Hashit on Pussy in the near future.
