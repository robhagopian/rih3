<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Co-Hare:</font>&nbsp; Bondo Jovi.</p>
<p<font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Meadow St, Woonsocket</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 20’s, snowing.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy, Dr WHO, Oozing SD, SESYB, Beyond Hope, Fergie, Ben, 
Jake, Seamus.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The group gathered at <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> garage hopefully. Until <font color="#FF0000">Beyond 
Hope</font> showed up.  Until the mystery hare showed up. Until they realized the mystery hare was <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Until they realized that the mystery hare had been assisted by Bondo. Until 
they realized that the hare had marked trail with red chalk valentines hearts. Until they realized that the light 
snow was going to cover all the hare’s marks. They should have just packed it in. But the hare promised virgin 
territory. [In Woonsocket, that’s about as likely as seeing a Pterodactyl and a Woolly Mammoth dining on Passenger 
Pigeons. In tuxedos. But I digress.]</p>

<p>Trail started towards Cold Spring Park. It entered the park. They turned south on the steep riverbanks through 
old snow with a light covering of the new stuff making it just slippery enough to be interesting. Coming out on 
River Street, they continued straight to a check by the railroad tracks. It took the hare to find marks at this 
point, so they simply waited after a few half-hearted attempts to find trail. He finally indicated trail crossing the 
river on Fairmount Street. Trail continued on streets, up hill to Third St, right and left to Chestnut St, where a 
dead end led into the woods finally.</p>

<p>The woods were sheltered enough that a few marks were actually found. This spread the group out a bit as they 
followed a generally uphill counterclockwise loop. It came back out however. On Chestnut Street. But not the same 
one. After some confusion, the trail was resumed, and soon came to the end of another cul-de-sac; the ubiquitous 
Chestnut Street again! Apparently, the Woonsocket town planners had a thing for Chestnuts. Or they were too lazy to 
connect the numerous branches of this street. At any rate, the trail was discernable in the woods, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> led. A light was seen atop a rock in the 
distance. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had short-cutted to the BC and was beckoning. The group gathered on 
what was reputedly the largest rock in Rhode Island. [It’s a pretty big rock. One could be proud of it, even in a 
bigger state. Like Delaware, or something. I wonder if they give tours during the daytime. They could sell popcorn 
and sodas at the base, on nice days. On Chestnut St. But I digress.]</p>

<p>The hare was pretty put out by the co-hare’s short-cutting ways, so one of the classic <font color="#FF0000">
Basket-Bondo</font> scenes took place, as they argued, spewed invective and generally whined so much that eventually 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> left, dragging Fergie with him, to short-cut back home. The rest finally had some 
peace to enjoy their beer, and the view, which encompassed a large vista of the night lights of northern RI (not to 
mention the headlights of a police cruiser called to investigate the commotion at the foot of the trail.) But the 
Woonsocket Police Department has new policies in place about investigating strange groups in the woods on Monday 
nights, and by the time back-up arrived, the group was long gone.</p>

<p>Trail back was pretty much a reversal of the trail in. The woods were traversed eastward, and they came out onto 
the roads, turned downhill to cross back over the Fairmount Bridge. They made their way back to Meadow by following 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> footprints, as they weaved back and forth across the roads. The circle was 
formed in the garage.&nbsp; Ratings for the run: Two bimbo’s, no marks, fine weather, and unbelievably, VIRGIN 
territory in Woonsocket. These factors outweighed the extensive asphalt, the bickering at the BC, the lack of losses 
or arrests, to give a total of +6.9!  Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could not care less. It’s a long time 
ago. Let’s just give it to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, as always. They moved upstairs for another <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> meal and more <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew. Another Monday evening, closer 
to death.</p>
