in Rumney, NH for the ski hash, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> wouldn’t expect 
a large crowd on Monday to share stories and recap all the good times?&nbsp; Well, 
probably not <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> as he was still nursing a hangover 
from the previous Saturday night, or at least attempting to re-hydrate after 6.9 
hrs in the sauna.&nbsp; But alas, there was no large crowd.&nbsp; There were no bimbos.&nbsp; 
There was 10 good inches of snow.&nbsp; And there was one Effin’s bartendress with a 
cute little butt.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></P>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">“On the Trail 1”</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt">So there we were,
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Wee Balls</font>,
<font color="#FF0000">Flobanger</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> – 
thinking “what a glorious day for a hash.”&nbsp; Just hours earlier New England got 
slammed with a somewhat surprise snow storm (snow, in New England, in March – <i>
are you serious</i>!?) which would provide at least one redeeming quality to the 
night’s run.&nbsp; The hare and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> strapped 
on………………their skis………….the rest went nekkid-footed.&nbsp; As the snow fell the hare 
marked on-out northeast into the woods, like usual.&nbsp; A little bushwhacking and 
snow camo’d water crossing had the pack finally hit true trail heading 
northwest.&nbsp; Surprisingly, those on skis did not outrun (or outski) the others, 
although multiple wipe-outs by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> did add some 
entertainment value.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">If you decide to

  <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">If you decide to

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">“On the Trail 2”</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt">The pack continued northwest 
with a few checks here and there, with a mix of trail and woods our path towards 
the beer.&nbsp; Fortunately <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>’s flour marks were 
still present on the trees despite being set the day before.&nbsp; Unfortunately the 
snow that came down that day didn’t cause enough confusion to break the pack up 
and get some lost.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Flobanger</font> was FRB for a good 
period of time, until we all came to a path blazed by some crazy 4-wheeler 
owner.&nbsp; Those in shoes rejoiced at the thought of breaking free from the fresh 
powder and running in tire paths, then got pissed as they realized the width of 
the tires would only help out those with feet the size of a 4 year old (which is 
different than the mind of a 4 year old, which those on trail could just barely 
pass for).&nbsp; Eventually the pack ended up at the base of a large field where four 
marks were seen on a padded football push-cart, which the hare noted would be 
close to the beer check, which the pack had no clue about because they didn’t 
listen to the hare give his chalk-talk.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">“The Beer Check”</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt">After making our way up the 
long and hard hill (unlike anything else on trail that night with the cold, cold 
weather) the beer was finally found.&nbsp; Discussions were short.&nbsp; Singing never 
happened.&nbsp; The sounds of sledding college girls filled the night air.&nbsp; Without
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> there was no Wild West Show, for which we 
were all grateful.&nbsp; With just us few wanks there was actually more than enough 
beer, again, for which we were all grateful.&nbsp; Once we’d had enough and the air 
finally started cooling us down the hare offered us options for going back to 
the cars: the quick way, the exact same way we came, in the back seat of a squad 
car.&nbsp; Wanting to get back quickly, and still thinking about that one Effin’s 
bartendress with a cute little butt we chose the quick way.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">If you decide to take 
  the quick way back, go to “On the Trail 3.”</span></b></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">If you were there and 
  knew nothing exciting happened and want a laugh instead, go to “Laughing at

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">“On the Trail 3”</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt">So, there were almost no 
marks on the way back.&nbsp; Or, if you were <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> (and
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would want to be <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>!??!!) 
there were no “mahks.”&nbsp; We went back down the hill, which was a helluva lot 
easier than going up, and south back into the woods.&nbsp; The route back mainly 
consisted of bushwhacking, but the few sections of trail we did hit had nice 
rolling hills.&nbsp; This allowed for quick progress back to the car, or in the case 
of <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, numerous opportunities to face plant in 
the snow.&nbsp; We all laughed.&nbsp; Paralleling Rt 5 we all thought we’d reached Effin’s 
with each parking lot with lights.&nbsp; And each time we’d realize we were wrong, 
which thinking back shouldn’t have been much of a surprise due to the fact that 
put together we have the intelligence of a typical lab rat.&nbsp; Finally we got back 
and being the nice guy he is (or, what most of us would refer to as “being the 
bitch”) <font color="#FF0000">Wee Balls</font> grabbed the circle beer from
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>’s car.&nbsp; Awwww.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size: 12pt">“Laughing at the Jackass”</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt">As the small pack prepped in 
the Effin’s parking lot some looked over to see <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, 
decked out like an Olympic skier with his fancy, tight, aerodynamic, shirt and 
wrap-around safety glasses (what, were we at the shooting range??)&nbsp; He looked 
serious.&nbsp; Seriously silly.&nbsp; But, we all gave him the benefit of the doubt and 
figured he’d drink all the beer by the time we got to the beer check due to his 
lightning-fast pace.&nbsp; Boy were we wrong, and boy were we happy about it!&nbsp; Not 
once, not twice, but more than twice (I can’t remember how many times) he went 
down.&nbsp; And went down hard.&nbsp; Porn star hard.&nbsp; Thanks big guy!</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

wrapped up Feats of Strength the numbers couldn’t lie – Negative .69.&nbsp; Yep,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt">What are 5 guys, fresh off 
the trail, looking for something to eat hungry for?&nbsp; The bartendress with the 
cute little butt, of course.&nbsp; It was nice, well-proportioned to her body and 
something you could really grab a hold of and take a bite out of.&nbsp; “It’s 
choice,” as Ferris Bueller would say.&nbsp; And what’s good with that?&nbsp; Effin’s 
wonderful fries and burgers.&nbsp; As we sat there acting and talking stupidly the 
beer flowed like wine, and the burgers tasted like steak.&nbsp; It was glorious.&nbsp; Or 
maybe it was skewed due to the sights.&nbsp; Unfortunately Effin’s had removed their 
dart boards and replaced them with a 60in flat-screen, with all of
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>’s coordination from early showing off I bet 
those two maroons throwing darts would have been entertaining to say the least.&nbsp; 
So, we sat and talked and drank and oogled, forgetting all about the hash only 
hours prior thinking of how scary it’ll be next week seeing everyone’s face on 
trail for at least the first few minutes until sunset…….</span></p>
