<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Virgin territory 
in Uxbridge! <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> said that <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> (the hare) was senile and incontinent and incapable 
of setting trail outside of Burrillville (the place to be in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> 
century)? The d’erections were somewhat confused but nevertheless, it was clear 
that the Rhode Island H3 was about to set off in unknown parts. In 
Massachusetts. The group somehow managed to ignore the d’erections and gathered 
in the parking lot of a medical office building just north of River Bend Park, 
in Uxbridge, MA. The hare arrived. He declared it a “live-hare” trail. He set 
off at 6:20. A woman approached in the parking lot and asked if the group was 
the hash. It turned out that <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Patty</FONT> (Boise H3) 
saw the marks on her evening run. She could not be convinced to join the group, 
but promised to make an appearance soon. As soon as she got back from the 
airport, no doubt!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">At 6:30, the 
group was off. They headed south through a short stand of bushes and trees into 
some fields that led to the River Bend Farm parking area and entrance. Led by 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT>, 
they crossed a bridge and turned immediately back north along the river. They 
came back to the parking lot. Gosh, that was fun. Some confusion led to the pack 
briefly scattering about, but soon, trail was found. They crossed the road and 
entered a field leading to a path parallel to the Blackstone River, heading 
north.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><FONT 
color=#ff0000>Eenie Weenie</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>JIMA</FONT> were 
leading at this point. Trail was easily followed but in spite of this, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> followed the 
first rule of hashing (where there are NO RULES!): When in doubt, go uphill (as 
long as you’re not following Basket)! They came upon marks (the On-Out trail) 
and followed them over Goat Hill and down to some fields and an old quarry. The 
rest stayed on trail close to the river. They found some checks that sent them 
west but ultimately, they came out in the quarries where they found the Beer 
Check.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Now, the hare 
wasn’t lost. Understandable, I think, if a bit improbable. But <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> was. And <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. And <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> were working 
backwards. So it was only the young bucks, the dogs, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> that actually made it to the spot (unmarked) that 
the hare elected to actually declare the BC. It was on the slopes of a sand and 
gravel pit. There was nothing whatsoever to recommend it otherwise. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> arrived and 
climbed up resignedly. A beer or two later, and WIPOS showed up. And then, 
beating all odds, Bondo! How could things get worse?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">There was some 
singing. There was some beer-hiding. There was some slipping down the steep 
sides of the gravel pit. What else is new? Finally, the hare offered two 
choices: his pre-marked On-Back trail (endorsed by <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Matt</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> as ridiculously boring). Or the 
hash could try the hare’s failed but innovative trail back across the river. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> hears the word river and runs. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> has a dog that doesn’t particularly like the idea of 
hashing, especially when there is a river involved. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, he’s a wanker. He always has beer in his truck, and 
wants the fastest way back. They left following <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt’s</FONT> footprints backwards. The rest, led 
by <FONT color=#ff0000>EWD</FONT>, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, 
tried trail east.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hare 
indicated that the more interesting trail was east, towards the river. A few 
marks were found, and then nothing. But a flow monitor on the banks of the river 
was seen, and next to it, a pulley system with a rope crossing the river. 
Irresistible! <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> gave it a try. Into the water 
he went. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was next. Into the water he went. It was 
clear that the rope was not supporting anyone’s weight. Nevertheless, they all 
gave it a try. The far side of the river was thorny and uninviting. The river 
was refreshing and clean. So after a brief discussion about the merits of 
following marked trail, the protesting hare was overruled and the hash began a 
lazy float/wade downstream. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">There were a few 
deep spots where the current carried the hash. These were very nice. Except for 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Swamp Whine</FONT> who had to perch her panicky little dog 
Rio on her shoulders. For being the Blackstone, the water was remarkably clear 
and after about a third of a mile, it was with some regret that, just before 
entering Rice Pond, they climbed out and resumed running. The In trail was 
easily found and followed backwards to the cars.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They circled up 
in some bushes on the south side of the medical lot parking. It was getting 
dark, and the mosquitoes were getting thick. Ratings for the run were 
charitable. The first half was without merit, but the river-walk-wade-swim was 
acknowledged to be outstanding, particularly given the absence of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. And the cloud 
of mosquitoes was increasing the rating as well. Total: +0.69. Hashit was 
something of a dilemma. So many sins, and so little time. The deciding factor 
was <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo’s</FONT> talking bottle-opener. Hashit to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! Finishing up, they convoyed to Hanna’s in Uxbridge, 
only to find it closed (obviously having heard that the hash might show up). So, 
off to Gators they went and concluded the evening with some baseball, some beer, 
and some volleyballing bimbos. Doesn’t get much better than 
that!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
