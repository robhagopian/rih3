<p><font color="#008000">Run #1096</font>, April 2, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Eenie Weenie Dick</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Wolf Hill, Smithfield</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 40’s, cloudy, just after rainstorm.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Amish It Head, Basket Boom Boom, Justin My Ass, Async, Oozing SD, 
Seamus. Virgin: Just John.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The usual crowd of wankers made it to the starting point at a clearing on Mountaindale Road just opposite the dam at 
the end of the Woonasquatucket Reservoir. It’s not even worth attempting to list the number of times this place has been 
hared, but most were curious to see if the hare could set his first trail without annoying stretches of pavement. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived, and immediately started whining about the finger he had broken at last week’s 
superlative hash. <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> showed up, and started taking pictures for some reason. Even a virgin 
showed. He had happened upon a beer check in Santiago, Chile, and unaccountably thought he might enjoy it here in RI. 
Little did he know what a gay time he would have. (<font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Swallows
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Mother Goose</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bungy
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fergie</font>: please come back and rescue us!)</p>

<p>The run started on the dirt road following the reservoir north. Most of the marks were at least partly washed out by 
the steady light rains from earlier in the day. Naturally, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> immediately took the unmarked road heading up to the quarry. Like the rest of us didn’t know that that would 
be where the beer was! But these two were so pathetic that they couldn’t even find the beer and only ended up finding the 
latecummer, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. The rest, led by <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> continued to the 
first check.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> turned right, figuring that they might as well 
get the hill climbing started. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> led the virgin north at the base of the hill on true 
trail. Soon enough (so as not to come out at the police station) trail turned right and uphill. But <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> led out to the powerlines. They found true trail across the lines and 
soon became confused. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turned back out to the powerlines and continued south until he was 
drawn back in by the hare. Only to find trail leading back out again. At a check, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried 
straight. He fell, loudly, to the inconsiderate amusement of <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font>. Fortunately, his camera 
was in his pocket. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> found trail again on the powerlines. The marks were really washed 
out here, and some white paint blazes on a cross-country trail caused further confusion. But the hare stayed put on a 
rock, hinting. <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> joined him to find a “BN” mark.</p>

<p>The “B” wasn’t all that “N”, though. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> found 
trail southwest back to the quarry. Trail circled the upper rim of the quarry clockwise, where anyone not half-blind or 
not completely imbecilic could have EASILY found it. Fully expecting to find <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, they found the “B” instead, and after a bit of a hit from the thirsty hare, the beer 
was found and opened. The view was fine, and improved briefly by the sights and sounds of <font color="#FF0000">Async
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and now <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> floundering around in the now 
dark quarry.</p>

<p>Songs were sung. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> joined the crowd on the narrow ridge atop the quarry cliff. 
Unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> soon arrived as well. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> immediately started whining about his pathetic broken finger from the brilliant hash just a 
week before. This was enough to put everyone off their beer, so they packed up and headed out, down the west side of the 
cliff to the dirt road. They crossed to the cars and quickly circled up.</p>

<p>Ratings for the run: the absence of pavement, the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and the fine views from 
the BC made up for the lack of lost hashers, as well as the lack of deaths at the BC. Total: <b>+0.69</b>! Hashit was 
initially given to <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, but <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, sensing the impending loss of 
the sexual aid within the hashit (it has comforted him mightily over the last few weeks), expressed regrets that <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was not present. Obviously, the hashit went back to him, immediately. The virgin was queried, 
and came up with a joke. Religion came next, and the group headed out to the former Swampy’s. They behaved exceptionally 
badly. This is what happens when a virgin shows. If he shows up again, it’s his own damn fault.</p>
