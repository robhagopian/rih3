In the field of mathematics, division by zero is a function in which the denominator is zero. Such a division can be formally expressed as A/0 : where A is the dividend and zero is the denominator. This expression has no meaning; as there is no number which when multiplied by 0 gives any real number such that a '0' When solving the expression no answer exists that is a real number, thus making it a null set {0}. Thus the solution can be ignored.  <br>  <br> 
 
 The overall rating for this trail is: trial divided by 0 = null set – this this trail can be ignored as an actual RIH3 sanctioned run. <br>  <br> 

One of the worst trails I have been exposed to in 5 years with the RIH3. Badly executed, badly laid, too much pavement, no beer, bad all around, bitch –bitch- bitch- bitch.  <br>  <br> 

After a great 1369 weekend in Pig Iron, NH the thought of a short live trail in nearby Lincoln had the potential to extend a great weekend into Monday. I was sorely mistaken. <br>  <br> 

Pubic housing and I were 5 minutes late, the pack was already long gone and left no on-out marks, it should have been clear at this point that we should have gotten back in the car and left, all parties would have been better off for it. <br>  <br> 

Once we found the first make, approximately ¼ mile from the parking lot the trail cut across the street into Lincoln woods then took a sharp decline in quality. The first portion of the trail, I would approximate maybe ½ mile of trail was actually marked with flour and could be reasonably followed, after that it became a maze of intersecting, overlapping, un-marked, or dead ending trails that no hasher with no buzz could follow. At some point I lost Pubic at a check  and then was lost on trail by myself for the remainder of my run. I never found the beer check <br>  <br> 

Approximately, an hour and a half later I finally found the pack and was informed that there were no fewer than four hares apparently laying a “live” trail, however many of their marks led either nowhere or into a huge loop.  Assquack and Harry were setting in flour and Rusty and Basket were setting in chalk and none of the marks made sense. I spent the remainder of the time on trial walking back to the start bitching until I was blue in the face, however is was pointed out that it was my own fault for coming in the first place. <br>  <br> 

The only other thing of note that happened on trail is that wipos never even attempted to find trail, rather he crossed the street at the lodge, walked into Lincoln woods and blew his horn for an hour hopping the pack would eventually come his way. WË  Interesting tactic, however ineffective and insane. <br>  <br> 

 Trail sucked – on in at the lodge, may god have mercy on your souls <br>
