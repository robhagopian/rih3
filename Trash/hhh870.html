<p>A respectable number for such a frigid night arrived 
in the usual timely fashion, complete with at least three <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font> layers each.&nbsp;&nbsp; We huddled together at the start, then promptly dove 
into the woods at 6:30 pm.&nbsp; The pack fanned out, climbing snow covered hills and 
dodging thorn bushes and branches.&nbsp; The distant sound of whistles was heard…a 
hasher on trail…what a glorious ending to hash year 2002 (which is incidentally 
the last pallindrum year until 2020).</p>

<p>The beer check took place on a hill overlooking a 
pit or quarry or something…I’ll leave that to your imagination.&nbsp; I was too busy 
opening beer bottles chilled, perhaps partially frozen, by Mother Nature 
herself.&nbsp; It was good beer, too, from what I can remember.&nbsp; Nothing eventful at 
the beer check, other than Seamus trying to pee on all the RIH3 bimbos feet – 
who can blame him for getting overexcited in our presence?</p>

<p>We took off down the hill and around a corner in the 
trail to see the <font color="#FF0000">Jizzmopper</font> slip on a huge slab of 
ice and fall splat on his back.&nbsp; We all laughed heartily, of course.&nbsp; Then the 
trail became truly interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were stone walls in the woods, which we 
hurdled over - some with grace and others with less than grace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, we 
were beckoned into a marsh filled with 8 foot high reeds, smelling as though 
they had recently been skunked – how delightful!&nbsp; No need for a machete, 
although that would have been nice, brute size and force were enough.&nbsp; We made 
our way through the reeds, then across some rather thin ice patches in a swamp 
area.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the ice did crack, but no one fell through.&nbsp; At this 
point, we were back on road and circled back to the start.&nbsp; Somehow,
<font color="#FF0000">Jizzmopper </font>conveniently found a turkey trail and 
ran a few miles off course.&nbsp; We presumed him dead, laughed heartily again and 
continued on with the circle up.</p>

<p>A warm fire greated us in the woods with more good 
beer to warm our insides.&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>had another flirtatious argument during 
which <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> shorts were burned in the inferno, a 
beautiful site for all the onlooking coyotes.&nbsp; The potent smell of burning 
nylon/polyester combined with leftover oils from <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> 
skin was so toxic that many of the hashers started gagging. The black rising 
soot could not be escaped.&nbsp; But alas - <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> plan 
to kill off the RIH3 by toxic inhalation failed miserably.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
everyone lived.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Virgin Brian</font> was 
appropriately questioned and given a down down.&nbsp; The hash songs were terrible 
tonight and a plea was made to go back to Hash Songs 101 next week.&nbsp; And so, we 
wrapped it up and met down the street at Swampys for the on after.&nbsp; 
Surprisingly, the waitstaff were happy to see us.&nbsp; Good God, did they remember 
this group correctly?&nbsp; Had they inhaled the fumes from <font color="#FF0000">
Basket’s</font> shorts?&nbsp; The usual carousal ensued, more beer was imbibed, and a 
good time was had by all.</p>
