<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">When: 24th Mar 1997….Where: Duval Sq. Providence…Who:
Dog Phart + Justin…Why: God only knows</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The pack consisted of One of the Hares (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dog
Phart</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">) and the motley hounds were </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Flaccid

and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">. I
knew the directions sucked when the sign read exit here for Downtown and
the following exit read Hartford CT. Downtown it would be, after zooming
up and down Eddy St like a lunatic I was as lost as the pack was going
to be for the remainder of this fair Mun Da(n)e evening. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At Waterpark Place, I enquired of a suit as to
the whereabouts of said Sq, his directions were good but he forgot to tell
me to turn left after 2 miles. The next brain told me to head back the
direction I came for about 4 or 9 sets of stop lights, I gestured my disgust
at the Guy and zoomed off again. Suddenly as if by chance or my map I found
the start. I recognized the cars in the dim light but no sign of the pack.
It was 6:45pm and the bastards had left, I was beginning to feel that they
didn’t want me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The directions posted on the WWW said take the
Allens Ave exit, there could have been Hashers flying in from all around
the world but it wouldn’t have mattered…….The Allens Ave Exit only exists
on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket's</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> 1869
map of RI and then you needed a boat to take the exit. Anyway, I sprang
from my car and ran about a 100’ and got a cramp, yelling with pain I continued,
found a X on the far side of the bridge and found jackshit across the Street
(despite the fact that there was at least 10lbs of flour). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hark, the sound of Fire Engines and Rescue Wagons
but no hashers, the Merit Gas Station was my next and almost last check.
Each of the three options was checked at least twice, however, I had missed
the briefing at the start of the run which said that the flour is spaced
at quarter mile intervals ! Eventually, I got back on trail heading towards
downtown, I was now out 30 mins and could neither hear an On-On nor the
sound of the horn. I lost trail again and kept going around in circles,
I was fearful of being arrested as I kept seeing the same pedestrians and
they were beginning to wonder what the hell I was up to. At Waterplace
Pk, I heard what sounded like an On-On in the area of College Hill. A swift
run up same was a bad idea, but there they were in the hazy distance, THE
PACK of 5…..I had made it. However when I caught up with them I was greeted
with “Have you seen any flour”. My ecstasy was shortlived, I had expected
better of the pack. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was confident that we should head to Muldoons, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
said wherever the Hare is going they have Guinness on Tap, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Flaccid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
said it’s not on Wickendon and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oop Doon the
Roo Add Uzie</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> stuck with the Hare and therefore
knew where he was going. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The pack of four went up and down the hill like
Jack and Jill never did, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Flaccid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
disappeared without a sound which led to a certain uneasiness with the
remaining tree, suddenly </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
said “Enough” let’s go back to the cars and go for a beer. A swift regrouping
saw us annoy the hell out of Don the barman who can now do a shamrock on
a Guinness. The Hare scored about 0.000069 for the run and the Hashit duely
went to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
for his (yet again) incredible directions. Is it possible that </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Friar
Fuck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">(Boston) and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
attended the same Geography class ? After consuming a side of chicken each
we pissed off into the Sunset in anticipation that the Comet might strike
Northern RI and therefore put an end to runs like this.</FONT></P>
