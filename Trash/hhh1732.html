It was sunny and 80 degrees at the start of the run with the first sign of heavy bugs of the season, The trail started at the JB Hudson trailhead off Ten Rod Road. There was some discussion as if this was virgin territory (it was not). Meat Wallet was reported to be out of town so this trail was Amish doing his thing all by himself (which he has perfected). We had our first virgin in a while (just Morgan) who looked shell shocked at the start. She indicated that Just the Tip brought her but he was not present at the chalk talk, It was obvious that chalk talk has not been done lately as the hare said: "there are some marks and stuff, you will figure it out, don't follow Basket". Donkey Punch felt like there was some important information omitted and tried to help by actually giving chalk talk, but was quickly chastised and overruled.<br/><br/> 

At 6:31 (late start) the hare indicated the trail started up the John N Hudson trail into Arcadia. Just at the pack was heading out. Just the tip pulled up, jumped out of his car and ran at top speed up the trail, completely ignoring his virgin and the rest of the pack. <br/><br/> 

The trail soon bushwhacked along the Frosty hollow trail and wound around the unmarked trails in the area. Approximately 10 minutes into the run the skies opened and a steady hard rain began to fall. It Poured for the next 25 minutes or more. The FRB's included Just the Tip, Assquack and Rusty (Front Rusty Bastard) that navigated the checks before they completely washed away. At one point along the trail the hare included a "CH" check, which stood for 'Cool Hole' check. There was a former house foundation that left a cool hole trailside.<br/><br/> 
Since there's no pic of the Cool Hole from this week, and just because Hairy wasn't there and wanted to see it, here's the Colder Hole from last week. It was just about the same hole, but 40 degrees colder, BUT it had whiskey. Always a plus.<br/>

At some point, the FRB's ran into a pack of shortcutting bastards which included Dr. Who, Rainbow Dick, and Wipos. The beer check was at the Thomas Wilcox historic cemetery. Hamster was the first to arrive, but could not find beer.

<br/>
The pack eventually trickled into the beer stop which included milk jugs of a little sumpen' ale, raincloud porter and all day IPA with a fine assortment of orange food. During beer check the two dogs made several attempts to play / fight that caused a ruckus which again seemed to startle the virgin. Soon after everyone arrived at the beer check the rain subsided, however, everyone was fairly soaked to the bone at this point. Several songs were sung including an Engineer Told me (the hare's go to song) and masturbation dedicated to Assquack who snuck off into the woods to either piss or wank or both. The pack also serenaded the virgin with "pubic hair" , which again, startled and confused the virgin. PG made an early exit because 'the baby sitter' and left before circle. Once the majority of beer was drunk (the hare did excellent beer math to have just a little left for circle) the pack was on out approximately a half mile down the jb Hudson trail to the parking lot.

The pack finally found the circle and rated the run. The virgin indicated she had to pick up a friend "at the airport" and could not attend circle and it appeared that we may have lost another one.   Very few complained about giving it positive reviews for the weather and fun rain. Several cool hole jokes were made. Thus Dr. Who giving a mathematical total of -.69<br/><br/> 

No virgin, or visitors so we moved to hashit.  Hashit was called forward. PG was the hashit, but was not present so Rusty stepped in.  Many sins were committed on trail. The  It seemed that Just the Tip was a shoe in for ignoring the virgin and losing her at circle, but in the End, Donkey got it for wearing a towel over his head to stop bugs from biting. Lobster man was sung and everyone enjoyed it.<br/><br/> 

On-In was at the Cornerstone food and beer were adequate. The server gave individual checks and some degree of confusion ensued.<br/><br/> 

Overall great start to warmer buggier summer trails. Could have used more meat wallet but otherwise pretty good.
