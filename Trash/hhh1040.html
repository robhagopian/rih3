<p><font color="#008000">Run #1040</font>, March 6, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Bondo Jovi</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Woonsocket, RI (where else?)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 40’s, clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish It Head, Basket Boom Boom, Cum Under PSHS, Dry Foot Fairy, Fuwangi 
Boner, G@GH, Oozing, WIPOS, Ben, and Seamus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, the hare, wused out on the x-country ski hash in Rumney.  His excuse?  He had to 
hare the following Monday.  Pathetic!  Therefore, since he missed the ski hash, he had no excuse for setting another 
miserable excuse for a run that could only be: (a) a clockwise loop around Bondo’s house through the streets of 
Woonsocket, or (b) a counterclockwise loop around Bondo’s house through the streets of Woonsocket.  With such high 
expectations, the usual suspects started to arrive.</p>

<p>So who was not there?  Yes, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was not there.  Obviously, our heralded surgeon had as 
sense of good judgment.  Either that or he was out of state somewhere on a pharmaceutical-paid-for conference needed to 
pimp out more drugs.  Nevertheless, nobody complained by his absence (except for those addicted to such drugs).  I 
digress.</p>

<p>The hare decided to take off.  Nobody followed him.  After all, why would they?  It was cold outside, the trail would 
be well-known, knee-jarring, all-too-familiar Woonsocket pavement.  And the best reason… there was a keg of beer in his 
garage.  Nevertheless, since the hare did not return and it was nearing 6:45 p.m., the pack gathered and took off.  But 
not before passing out Depends for everyone to wear, some the right way, some the wrong way, and others on their head.  
(<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> would have to make a late-night trip to CVS to replenish his stock).</p>

<p>Despite low expectations, the pack departed on what appeared to be a predictable, boring clockwise jaunt around the 
hare’s house – Winter St, to Summer St, to Spring St, and back down to Harris Ave.  And to complete all that anyone has 
ever come to know about a <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> hash, the pack went into Cold Spring Park, led by <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  Marks quickly disappeared in the darkness of 
night.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> searched one way, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> another, <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> another, while <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> 
observed the spectacle.  Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> found true trail, which led out to Singleton St. and 
turning right back to Harris Ave.</p>

<p>Trail headed north along Harris Ave for what seemed miles until a check was reached at Federal St.  This only fooled 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, as this was surely a mere loop up the hill, 
down Ascension St. and back to Harris Ave again.  Not fooled by this, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> continued down Harris with <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> in tow.  Trail bent left 
(west) along Main St. to Tupper Park.  At this point, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> knew exactly where the beer 
check would be.  All were dying of thirst and shin splints.</p>

<p>Trail continued straight down County St. and left toward the factory and a predictable right into the woods.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, once FRB’s, now DFL’s followed the others trying to 
catch the pack.  Through the woods and onto the edge of the deepest chasm of Woonsocket (no, we’re not talking about 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> ass), the beer check was finally reached.  Even Seamus and Ben were exhausted by this 
long quest for beer.</p>

<p>After the beer check, the hare took off telling the others to just go back the way they came – 2 miles back to his 
house, which was an uneventful and long run back down County St, to Main St, to Harris Ave, to Meadow St.  Circle was held 
after all the stragglers finally made it to Bondo’s garage.  Not much to say about this run except for the fact that 
nobody could have believed <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was physically capable of laying such a long, gruesome, 
knee-jarring, shin splinting trail.  But give the guy a weekend, and he could actually lay a trail worth running.  In 
other words, Brilliant!  The mathematical total equaled a <b>+6.9</b>!  And for reasons comprehensible to all, hashit went 
the most incomprehensible to all – <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>.</p>

<p>On-on-on was the usual chili at <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font>, but this time without <font color="#FF0000">JBS
</font> to help out (god help us all!).  Nevertheless, the famished ate heartily and all were content, or else delirious.  
And yet another pathetic excuse for a Monday evening concluded.</p>
