style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">After getting 
lost in his own back yard, on a <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> trail, of all 
things, the hare was anxious to redeem himself. He failed. Trail started from 
the fishing area at the south of Spring Lake. An unusual number of females 
showed up, a statistical improbability that defies all explanation. But <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Cumsocket To Me</FONT> coerced her sister and friend, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT> coerced <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic 
Housing</FONT>, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Scatwoman</FONT> should have known 
better. But she missed a lot of our hashes over the summer. And maybe she wanted 
to get together with <FONT color=#ff0000>Dogmeat&nbsp;</FONT>(dream on, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>!), who was at the start as bag lady. At least <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> didn’t show.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail started 
off on overgrown trails, heading southeast away from the lake. The marks were 
few, but not really all that challenging. There was minimal shiggy. The pack was 
mostly together, with the virgins taking advantage of mistakes by leaders <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> to find 
the true trail. They turned east and came to a tunnel crossing under Rt 102. 
OOOh! Scary! There were plenty of squeals and such, especially as the water 
level began to rise as they crossed deeper into the tunnel. This was the high 
point of the run. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> remembers anything 
else.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">I think there 
was a beer check about this point. I’m not sure. I don’t really care. But even 
if there was, the hare’s still a WANK! At any rate, trail from this point was 
pretty much a lost cause. It was getting dark, there were marks leading to a 
check in the woods, but after trying to find additional marks in 69 directions, 
the group gave up and headed for the streets. At the recommendation of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Virgin Mike</FONT> (brilliant idea, by the way, to use a virgin 
for d’erections!), they took East Ave to the Victory highway, to try to find 
Tuffy’s which seemed a likely end point, as they were pretty far from the hare’s 
house, and a bag car had been used. They went every way but the correct 
one.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Off in the 
distance, the hare’s horn could be heard. <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> entered the woods and found some nice 
(unmarked) trails. They found the hare and <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> by 
the Whipple Ave underpass. He had no beer, and was unrepentant about his 
pathetic trail. Autohashing was vehemently denied. Ha! The hare did give 
directions to<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>the On On On and the 
group eventually made their way to Tuffy’s on the Victory Highway. They gathered 
and in groups, were shuttled back for their cars.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They circled up 
behind the bar. Ratings for the run focused on the almost complete lack of 
marks, and excess of pavement. Only the tunnel and the lack of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> gave the hare any relief from the blistering and 
completely appropriate trashing this run deserved. Total: -6.9. The virgins were 
queried, and sang some crazy Tonga song or something. Hashit was given to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> for autohashing. Finishing up, they went in and had 
greasy food, and weak beer while the biker crowd looked on with 
disgust.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
