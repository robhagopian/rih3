<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hash was in freezing Smithfield starting from
Box Seat's with Bondo the hare. Hashers gathered included <font color="#FF0000">Async,
Dr WHO Slasher, Shine On, Basket, WIPOS, PW, Cumonya, Just John</font> and yours
truly the scribe <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. The hare sent us off
promptly at 630 behind the restaurant towards now familiar territory around
Stump pond.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The first check took us south around the
pond. Some of us ventured onto the frozen pond but soon had to head back. The
trail soon came to a wet crossing which after a few double thoughts we all
crossed cursing the hare as the temp was rapidly dropping with yours truly in
lead and relishing the prospect of freezing feet again!&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Onto another check that now took us away from the
pond and back towards the road (104/5), and now trail was set in white toilet
paper which stood out really well against the white snow! Needless to say once
across the road trail was soon lost, giving everyone opportunity to catch up
including&nbsp; those who set off across the pond. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Shine On&nbsp; </font>were mysteriously missing and
the pack concluded that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> didn't want to be the
only one not to have slept with <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>, exc. me
of course and I don't know why I haven't, call me gay!&nbsp; Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Cumonya</font>
who had stopped for a pee and was looking around for something to wipe herself
with found...toilet paper! and the pack soon was back on trail that led us
around the woods on the opposite side of the road and back onto the road and
back to the pond!&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; A &quot;B&quot; was spotted that meant but
one thing to these half-minds and soon delightful squeals were heard from the
middle of the pond, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> in his infinite wisdom
had lit a fire in the middle of the pond! Some may say he is emulating his idol
again (Hemingway), and is looking to kill himself and the whole pack with him! <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> was topless and what seemed like dancing around the fire as in a war
dance, although I think she was running and gathering her clothes after doing it
with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>! Now although the lake was frozen, yet
around it it was not and despite the plank that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
had put down for a bridge, people were soon in water, but the smell of beer
lured us on and into the middle! So it was out in the middle of a frozen lake
with a bonfire that the wise-Rhody hash had their beer check and sang many
ditties, with <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> reconfirming why he stays away and
using a newborn as an excuse! <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> took off early
and took the plank away too not that it made much of a difference!&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With beer consumed we headed back to the bank
once again enduring wet and cold water and back towards the bar for the
circle-up in the woods with another fire burning. With the hare in the circle,
many comments including too short, too dry and too little toilet paper meaning
that Bondo is not after all constipated!&nbsp; Down downs also to returnee (<font color="#FF0000">PW</font>),
hashit (<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>), and to <font color="#FF0000">Cumonya</font>
for her last run with the best hash in the world-she is cute and will be sorely
missed! (Yes, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, you're cute too!). The pack
warmed their feet to the fire and soon smelt burning rubber as <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>'s
feet had been anaesthetized by the freezing water couldn't feel the fire!&nbsp;
ONON at Box Seat's with good food and Guinness/Bass would we accept anything
less? A good time had by all....
