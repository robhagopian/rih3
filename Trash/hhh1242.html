color=#000000>Another all-male hash was in store, mainly because SWF’s don’t 
last long in Central Falls. And maybe the ladies had read some write-ups and 
knew what was in store at a <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> hash. But good 
judgment is in short supply at the RIH3, so yet again, winter numbers were in 
double digits. The details are perhaps a bit sketchy. But all that pavement 
pounds it out of your scribes brain. At any rate, as soon as the pack saw <FONT

avoid this, and followed the flashlights from Mill Street. The trail eventually 
(and inevitably came up to Mill, and continued east to the railroad tracks. A

acting confused. <o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

the spur line and turned north, back into the woods by the banks of Happy Hollow 
Pond. There was no shiggy except for some snow and half-frozen puddles. But 
there were powerlines. All too soon however, they were back on the pavement, 
heading west. The pack was mostly together. As they crossed Broad<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>and continued west on John, they were 
thoroughly sick of all this asphalt. What did they expect? But it was clear that 
the trail would be back via Valley Marsh. Sure enough, despite poor markings, 
trail was found heading south on the new bike path.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>There were a total of two marks per mile on the bike path. Except 
of course, for the unnecessary loops down into the marsh. They all were 
followed, as it was obviously getting close to the beer check. Finally, the last 
loop led them through some snow and ice covered marsh. Breaking through now and 
then, they finally came to the beer, and the hare. The beer was found (no help 
from the wanking hare) and the usual round of rhubarb was 
commenced.</FONT></SPAN><SPAN

color=#000000>Beer finished, they backtracked through the marsh, and continued 
south on the bike path, came out onto yet more pavement, and turned down Broad 
St. back to the cars. The circle was held next to the Dragonboat docks. Ratings 
focused on the pavement, of course, and the lack of bimbos. But no <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, some decent winter shiggy and relief that it was 
over, and that <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> would not hare again for at 
least two months were reasonable counterarguments. Total: -0. The two-timer and 
the virgin were serially punished, and Hashit went, as always, to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. The evening concluded at an overcrowded East Ave. 
Café, where they were giving out samples of some watery American “beer”. Fine 
way to end a hash!</FONT></SPAN>
