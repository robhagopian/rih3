one eye):</p>

Well I wasn't really there; I arrived Sunday after having put in one contact<br>
with cleaning solution (mega ouch). One Drunk was there, but doesn't<br>
remember very much. So I will include a list of topics and hearsay. Send me<br>
more and I'll add to hearsay. Oozing is supposed to be putting together a<br>
hash trash, but this will have to do for the interim (too many good stories<br>
to not give this a try)<br>
<br>
Flour shortage returns: During the run on Saturday, Deep Throat ran out of<br>
flour on trail. She had to go ring a neighbor's doorbell and ask for more.<br>
A lovely 70 something year old woman asked Deep Throat who she was, and then<br>
gave her more flour, provided she didn't put any on her house! Thanks lady!<br>
That's when Oozing and Deep Throat got caught and the pack decided to find<br>
the on-in on their own.</p>

<p><b>Additional Notes from CA…</b></p>
<p>Quote of the night:&quot;Just my luck to be kissing a guy all night who had been<br>
drinking piss all along...&quot; DeepThroat.<br>
<br>
First Drunk: Cream Whora was wobbling by 7 p.m. But although he kept<br>
falling, he kept getting back up. He wobbled his way to the beach, with<br>
some assistance from other hashers.<br>
<br>
Martinis: there were martinis, and also Trinity beer and maybe Bondo brew<br>
(it was all dark beer, and it all looks the same to me). Mojitos were the<br>
drink of choice for dinner and breakfast. Martinis were for dinner and<br>
lunch. Martinis are blamed for the Urine Hallway episode (see below).<br>
Martinis are also blamed for Lubie's spying on sleepers, also his puking<br>
(see below).<br>
<br>
Food: Submarine sandwiches (in deference to the possible arrival of NH3?),<br>
beer, calzones, beer, antipasto, mojitos, junk food on Saturday. Sunday was<br>
more mojitos, eggs, beer, muffins, beer, fruit, mojitos, sweet bread, beer,<br>
Portuguese soup, beer, bread, Shepard's pie, beer, and calzone for our<br>
vegetarian ... Cock Climber. All but one serving of food was eaten by the<br>
hearty appetites.<br>
<br>
The Urine stories:<br>
Urine Hallway: There was urine on the rug in the hallway on Sunday. Turns<br>
out that my sub-scribe mistook the doorway for a urinal. He somehow stopped<br>
midstream when Puff n Stuff yelled at him, and made his way to finish in the<br>
bathroom. Numerous household hints for &quot;pet stain&quot; removal have followed on<br>
the hash list.<br>
<br>
Urine Mug: someone (Lube Me In) peed in Puff In Stuff's mug, which explains<br>
why the beer tasted stale.<br>
<br>
Urine Luge: Seems that someone created a urine luge, which explains why Puff<br>
n Stuff did not get drunk doing shots. Couldn't you guys have picked on<br>
someone else besides Puff n Stuff on Saturday night?<br>
<br>
Barfing: fortunately all in the usual places ... outside by WinToe's Dad<br>
Mobile, Lubie puked in the backyard, and probably in the bathrooms.<br>
<br>
Walking On Water: Saturday night by the water ... Penicillin from Ottawa<br>
proved that hashers couldn't walk on water when he pushed Mary Kay (and<br>
possibly Cream Whora, according to my set of drunk correspondents ..<br>
possibly CW fell in) into the ocean. Unfortunately, they were by a drop off,<br>
and disappeared beneath the water, leaving a floating quilt on the water's<br>
surface. Oh, and did I say that Penicillin was naked when he tackled the<br>
harriers?? Hmmm?<br>
<br>
Things that go bump in the night: ummm well, there certainly was a lot of<br>
snoring (don't need to be there to know that!)<br>
<br>
Tequila: It became clear why Pencil Dick &quot;fell asleep&quot; on the ride back. He<br>
and One Drunk drank over half a liter of tequila in only a few minutes on<br>
Sunday afternoon.<br>
<br>
Grandma Red at the Sat night On-In bar: Hashers were not sure if she was<br>
just a drunken local or if she actually worked there. But she was fascinated<br>
by the Hash and came back after a minute away with a hardhat with a<br>
propeller on it. So what if she was dentally challenged? You know how<br>
WinToes likes propellers (I don't want to hear the end of this story!).<br>
<br>
Promises, promises:<br>
And here is a quote: &quot;Just a quick reminder to all who are taking part in<br>
the 1st annual beach interhash. Bring extra socks and shoes at the very<br>
least. I cannot stress it enough to all of the Boston urban shiggy lovers<br>
that this entire w/e is going to be served up RIH3 style. Plenty of real<br>
hash shiggy, which means cold, wet, muddy, feet. Also, I think in an effort<br>
to keep the house in decent shape. All shoes will be left outside.&quot;<br>
--- Okay, this was true for Saturday, but not for Sunday, according to<br>
reports.<br>
<br>
Recycled Ice Luge: seems that Penicillin got his for trying to drown hashers<br>
on Saturday night. At Sunday's circle he was seated on the ice (with a nice<br>
crosswind) for a solid 10 minutes while he was serenaded by the hash. And<br>
what WAS that clinging to his butt when he finally got off the ice?<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the bikini clad bods at the circle<br>
on Sunday ... they were very very cold. The bikini tops were very very<br>
small. These 2 hares lasted through the comments on the run and went inside<br>
and changed.<br>
<br>
All in all, another great hash weekend.</p>
