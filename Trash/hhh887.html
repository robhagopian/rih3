<p><font color="#0000FF">Run #887</font>, April 14, 2003<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> Oozing &amp; Trail Hoover<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Scribe:</font> Async<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> East Greenwich<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather: </font>60’s, clear.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present: </font><font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD, Trail Hoover, Async, WIPOS, Slasher Dr WHO, Basket

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The first trail of the season with halfway decent weather brought out some of the Rhode Island Hash's finest 
backsliders.  <font color="#FF0000">Bill the Beak</font> took a break from his usual seat at the end of the Lil' Bear bar 
to join us in the parking lot of the East Greenwich Pub.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <font color="#FF0000">Red Snapper</font> 
managed to tear the apron off of <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> long enough to drag him out of the house and down to 
the start of the hash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, having run out of both nurses and fresh 
body parts to reconstruct down at RI Hospital, joined the hash for the evening.<</p>

<p>The unusually large pack gathered in the dusty parking lot of the upscale E.G. Pub in the first sunlight seen by the 
RIH3 since last September.&nbsp; (Theoretically, the week before in Smithfield was supposed to be the first post Daylights 
Savings Time run, but the hash gods punished <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom </font>with an early spring snow 
storm.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his pre-run brief, Hare <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>mumbled some incomprehensible 
nonsense in his usual Pakistani-Scottish-Rhode Island accent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the lovely young <font 
color="#FF0000">Ms. Hoover</font> translated on his behalf:&nbsp; &quot;Go north, laddies....and look for trail on the 
left.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay on the fuukin' trail or you'll miss the scenic beer checks.....&quot;.</p>

<p>The pack headed north on the Goddard PENISula, then left into Goddard State park.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A beeline across 
the freshly mowed lawns of the park led us into the wood and down to the shoreline.&nbsp;&nbsp; An unusually high spring 
tide left little room along the shoreline between the hill and the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; At a check at the water's edge,
<font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;Async </font>foolishly headed due north along the shore, figuring the beer check would be at 
the usual spot at the end of the PENISula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hare even followed north to convince the gullible to head 
north also.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FRBs <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font> and&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
found the true trail heading south along the shoreline.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The true trail went up the steep hill every now 
and then, but invariably headed back to the flooded shoreline.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the cove, the trail made a u-turn 
along the coves' shoreline and deep into a briar patch.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to follow trail, the hounds had a choice of 
getting wet or getting scratched.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> chose a third option.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Wanting neither wet shoes nor scratched legs, our fearless fire prevention officer headed straight over the small PENISula, 
bypassing the beer check.</p>

<p>The pack enjoyed a scenic beer check overlooking the cove.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hashers took turns throwing large sticks, 
branches and trees into the frigid salt water for Ben to retrieve....in the hopes of drowning the obnoxious canine.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once back on dry land, Ben exacted revenge by whacking hashers in the legs with the retrieved sticks.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the beer check was over, the pack noticed a high-speed Acela train hurtling northward in the distance.
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Gee, I wonder if <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> is over there somewhere....&quot;.</p>

<p>Back on trail, the pack followed the trail through the scrub and gnarled trees between the shore and the street.&nbsp; 
Eventually, the flour led us up the embankment below the Amtrak tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trail wound its way along the edge 
of the railbed ballast and a fetid pool of water down below the embankment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The truly foolish half-minds in the 
pack followed the trail across the stagnant pond scum.&nbsp;&nbsp; The real trail led across the continuously welded rails 
of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.&nbsp; No sign of <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless' </font>mangled remains.</p>

<p>In the fading daylight, the pack followed trail thru an industrial area and across Route 1 and into some wet shiggy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> managed to suck elder statesman <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom
</font> onto an obvious false trail on the opposite bank of a stream while the rest of pack headed west along the north 
bank of the river.&nbsp; Following trail along the river, the pack soon found the second beer check at a waterfall below 
a local pond.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;Ms. Hoover</font> emerged from the woods dragging a cooler.</p>

<p>The pack circled up in the mist below the waterfall.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't remember too many details about the circle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me take a stab at what probably happened.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> started things off by singing, &quot;The Monks of St. Bernard....&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; Hares in the Circle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hares <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Hoover </font>
stood together in the circle for the rating of the run.&nbsp;&nbsp; An unequivocal 6.9 from most participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; A 10 on the <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> scale.&nbsp; No rating from the conspicuously absent <font 
color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font>.&nbsp; (Was he plastered on the front of a Boston-bound Amtrak locomotive?)&nbsp; 
Backsliders were punished.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bondo was awarded the hashit for reasons forgotten, but undoubtedly deserved.
&nbsp; Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.</p>

<p>About half the pack elected to ride back to the onon at the EG Pub.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest ran across Route 1 in the 
dark.... dodging SUVs, Mercedes, and Beemers enroute to the local PTA meeting.</p>

<p>Back at the EG Pub parking lot, the wayward <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> was waiting with the <font 
color="#FF0000">Snapper</font>.&nbsp; He was heard mumbling some nonsense about having to sweet-talk an EG policeman out 
of a trespassing citation at the railroad tracks.&nbsp; Me thinks he was taking advantage of a rare kids-free moment for 
a little fire hose play in the back of the truck with the <font color="#FF0000">Fergermeister.</font>.....but then again, 
we know the red headed one has always preferred macho bankers.....</p>

<p>A delightful evening ensued in the lively East Greenwich Pub.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lovely bartender cheerfully 
took breaks from a riveting episode of slug-eating washed-up celebrities on&nbsp; &quot;Fear Factor&quot; to serve pitchers 
of some truly outstanding stouts, porters and ales to the Rhode Island Hash.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hares <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font> brought in several pizza pies.&nbsp; Even a couple of veggie pizza 
pies suitable&nbsp; for wimpy middle-aged ex-California hashers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quality of the on-on songs was 
greatly enhanced by the presence of the lusty sweet voice of the <font color="#FF0000">Snapper</font>.</p>

<p>Ok, time for me to rate the run.&nbsp; Medium length, halfway decent virgin shiggy, two bimbos, good singing, veggie 
pizza.&nbsp; Points subtracted for the presence of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo,</font> <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>
and their hounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Points added back for <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>keeping his clothes on.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Points added for lots of old timers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lots of points for the delightful ambience of the on-on venue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, I give this run a &quot;6.9&quot; on the <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
scale.</p>
