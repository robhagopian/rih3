(hare), </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom, Beyond Hope, Deep
Throat, Little Neck, Oozing Syph, Rusty, Itchy Bro </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and
yours truly. The conditions were absolutely perfect at 50 degrees F with
an extra hour of light.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The run started off by the side of the pond quickly
converging into the first of many wet crossings, some of us elected to
go the dry route but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
being up to his short fat hairy knees in shit was determined to get every
body as wet as he was.&nbsp;&nbsp;The run continued through scenic areas
with your scribe as usual at the back after taking the first two checks
in the wrong bloody direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Deep
Throat</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> was even further back not wishing to
get her dainty little plates of meat wet (feet), taking huge detours that
even </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
would have been proud of. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Before long it was obvious the checks were not
well placed as the Gazelles of the RIH3 spread the pack very thin, and
some of us who will remain nameless (the one who normally has a communicator
with him) forgetting to call on trail, hence your scribe was on his own
checking out all the checks, always going up the falsie first. [</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#800080">editor's
note: the scribe is indulging in blatant whining at this point] </FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000">I
cannot believe I never lose 10 lb’s on these runs. Again I had been shafted
by a cunning hare, found myself going up a track off trail, after a brief
retrace I found myself back on trail in the middle of a quarry with a check
that could have gone anywhere-you Bastard. This time however seeing no
footprints in the areas you were expecting me to go I followed the obvious
trail which halfway up the precarious climb, I heard the fart of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and shouts of “down here you slow Bastard”-or
words to that effect. Eventually finding my way to the first beer stop
after having to get wet just to get a beer, which was well worth it I have
to say. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Deep Throat </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">was
the only one still missing but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
offered to go look for her, why didn’t he bother looking for me I ask myself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">No sooner had I got my lips to the beer the pack
was off on the second leg, with your scribe hardly catching a breather.
Again before I finished my beer the bastards were out of site, I’m getting
quite used to running solo now! Seeing as the checks were obviously crap,
even I only got one wrong. </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#800080">[editor's note:
the whining scribe is obviously badly out of shape] </FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
path led down to a rocky area where the hare had set up a fire to mark
our second beer stop, a great area the only blemish being the beer-which
was a lemon, piss tasting shit, which lost you a mark on the rating. fortunately
there was some other shit which we were just able to drink. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">After nearly an hours worth of running it was
still daylight with the odd mosquito coming out for a bite, songs and jokes
for which your scribe was given a down down, which I nearly choked on by
the way, we put out the fire under the supervision of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and made our way back in twilight to the start point, with nobody missing,
we circled up with the Hal-Bob comet in full view, we were all waiting
to see if we were going to be beamed up by the aliens, then we realized
we were the aliens still searching for the elixir of life-GOOD BEER!!!!
The run was highly rated by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
who gave a ten! without doubt this was the best set run for some time with
exception to the lousy checks and the shitty beer it was worth a 6.5 in
anybody’s book and the only positive mark awarded since I have been running
with the RIH3. Ceremonies completed the Hashshit award went to Basket.
The on-on was at Nicki’s which has the connotation of scantily dressed
women was no more than a doss house and was the low point of the whole
evening and sent a good positive mark into the negative category, Budweiser
or Coors on tap is only a marginal improvement over tap water, the subs
were OK but this must be the worst dive we have been in for a year. Never
the less a memorable evening, good job </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
shame about the beer. </FONT></P>
