<p><font color="#008000">Run #1046</font>, April 17, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; WHO's House in Tiverton, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 60, partly cloudy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Oozing, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS, Dry Foot Fairy, Amish It Head, Cumunder, 
Bondo Jovi, Fawangi, Trail Hoover, Async, Seamus, Ben.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Ok, ok – so I forgot to name my previous two hash write-ups, is that a sin?  Or more of a sin than just showing up to 
the hash with you wanks?</p>

<p>I think not.  But one sin beyond all sins is inviting the hash to your house.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would 
do such a stupid thing like that?  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would!  What started out looking like a fantastic hash 
with only <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
and the hare present quickly went downhill with the arrival of <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font>.  And then <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  And even worse, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  And even worse worse, <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  And even worse worse worse, well – you get the idea.</p>

<p>The pack left as close to on time as possible and followed trail west on Main Rd towards the Rt24 onramp before heading 
right, uphill into the woods.  Except for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> who (not <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>) 
kept running towards Rt24 without anyone calling him back.  Why would we?!  After a few upsies and downsies through a 
rock-laden trail and a few checks that had to keep us going north paralleling the highway (going left meant running into 
Rt 24, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows if <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided to go that way) we ended 
up at a field with small signs marked “Private Property.”  It’s only illegal if you get caught, right?  Most followed the 
arrow placed on a rock.  Someone (but I’m not one to name names, right <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>?) moved the 
rock to point the arrow in a different direction.  Brilliant!  Unfortunately it didn’t manage to misplace any hashers, but 
it did manage to make <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> complain.</p>

<p>Once through what was to be one of one hundred and fifty-three stone walls we ended up in a beautiful little area with 
multiple merging paths, a cute little pond., and gorgeous beat-down Ford F-150 with “WEED” spray painted on the roof.  So 
breathtaking was this area that <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> was overwhelmed and managed to forget <font 
color="#FF0000">Fawangi’s</font> name.  Let’s all be frank here though (except for <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font>, 
she should stay <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font> because the last thing the RI Hash needs is more man), if there is 
anyone’s name to forget it would be <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi’s</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> picked up 
a lampshade and tried to offer anyone a “nightstand.”  In a surprising moment of hash intelligence, no one accepted.</p>

<p>True trail was found shortly after and the pack started north-west, right towards a wonderful shiggy pit.  I didn’t 
notice <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> shoes before, as they were sure to have told a tail of what was in store.  Mud.  
Ankle deep mud.  Ankle deep mud with a wonderful rainbow sheen of what had to have been waste oil.  Someone hold me.</p>

<p>After covering a fair distance of the above mentioned shiggy pit, the crew plopped up onto a nice dike, or dam, I’m not 
sure which.  Somehow <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font> managed to secure position of FRB and led everyone over another 
one of those stone walls and through some rough-cut trail with lots of leaf-covered rocks and holes.  Whether <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS’s</font> walking stick was useful in this situation is still a debate (a masturdebate?!), he still 
managed to hang with the pack so it obviously didn’t hurt.  Trail worked slowly west and then dead-ended into Fish Rd.  
<font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font> crossed.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> turned farther west into an intersection 
of two trails.  Being not so bright he chose the one with more briars.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> in this hash is 
bright though?  Calling on-on he lead the pack through what should be described as briars with a path through it, not a 
path with briars on it.  This ended into yet another open area and who did <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> see other 
than <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>.  How?  They were behind everyone a 
little while ago and now that they were ahead it meant only one thing.  A circle jerk!  And not the kind with a happy 
ending either – this one meant more briars, therefore more pain!</p>

<p>After a little running around in tiny circles true trail was found on a nicely packed path, but not for long as <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> saw a mark to the left into the woods.  Claiming he was going to take a piss, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> being darn-near blind not being able to see the mark, the pack almost kept going straight 
allowing <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to have the beer to himself!  This was soon corrected and all proceeded at a 
whopping snails pace through trees, briars, and more mud prior to arriving at a “pudding” rock marked with a B.  No 
pudding was found.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was lifted on top of the rock.  Others walked around in a 
brainless stupor.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> found the beer.  <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font> could not 
reproduce the one-beer drunken show of last week.  Boo!</p>

<p>In what was to be one of the hash’s most pathetic beer checks of 2006, only <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
attempted to sign a song.  None listened.  Very fitting.  Hot nuts were consumed (I don’t remember anyone making any “hot 
nuts in the mouth” jokes – can this really be true?), and beer downed as discussion led to last weekend’s Boston Marathon 
hash.  Somehow <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> managed to resist the urge to get naked.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, well, we all know he has to fight the urge to NOT get dressed in the morning so him getting 
naked was a given.  And <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> else bared all?  None other than <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
himself.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish’s</font> decision to skip the Boston hash couldn’t have been better.</p>

<p>Incoming rain and impeding darkness had the group heading out shortly after arrival to the beer check and soon enough 
we found a trail leading back towards Highland Rd, with only a stop for the circle on the top of a lookout tower keeping 
them away from food.  With a nice view, rain holding off and beer it’d seem like a great place to hang out – until you 
looked around and saw <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> you were hanging out with.  Comments on the run included: virgin 
shiggy in non-virgin location, everyone being happy <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font> wasn’t introduced to <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> daughter, no singing at the beer check and some others.  I can’t remember and is it really 
that important?  Mathematical sum on the run: <b>-0.069</b>.  I think.  Or <b>0.069</b>.  Is that really important 
either?  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> for sitting down and complaining on trail.  Most of the 
group packed into the hare’s pimpmobile for a ride to the house.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided to be men and run the one mile back.  Of 
course 1/8th of the way there they started complaining like little girls due to the abundant amount of pavement.</p>

<p>Beers and pizza were consumed back at the Little Bear, which not so surprisingly had a caved little bear in the dining 
room.  What was surprising was the appearance of a shower in the men’s room.  What goes on in the Little Bear stays in the 
Little Bear?</p>
