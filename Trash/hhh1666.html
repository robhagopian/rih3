Run #1666, The Wipos trail Feb 12, 2018<br/>
Weather: Tirdytwa and dropping<br/>
Hare: Guess<br/>
Start point: Stop & Shop, Seekonk, MA<br/><br/>

12 hashers arrived behind Seekonk 152 stop and shop. None actually wanted to be there. <br/><br/>



Trail took us over the store's cesspool and into the woods. Abruptly turning a corner and stopping for a whisky check. Yay! Then the hare informed us he wanted us to be good and lubed up for what was to cum. Boo!
<br/><br/>
Trail wound it's way around some parking lot run offs that weren't there before, then made its way down the back entrance through a neighborhood. The pack zig zagGed around briars and streams all the way to the railroad tracks. There were very few checks on trail as after all the hare was working with halfminds. Just on the other side of the train tracks was a fallen ladder bridge over a moderate sized stream. Visions of WIPOS himself falling off a similar bridge entered the packs minds. After much ado about nothing the entire pack missed the beer check and had to meander on out-trail for what seemed like hours until backtracking led us to where we had been before. Beer check was beside the local landscape nursery. <br/><br/>
Out-trail was on the road and everyone complained about it. Even WHO. We circled up behind the same cesspool from the start and made the hare drink, the backsliders drink, and the hashit drink. On-after was at Boundary Brewhouse.
