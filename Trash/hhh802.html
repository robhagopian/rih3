<p>It’s a Monday in Tiverton, hard by the clear blue water, well kept homes
looking out towards Middletown, Fall River just a memory. Beautiful clear skies,
low humidity, the perfect night for a Hash among a great warren of trail in a
little visited part of the State. What could go wrong?</p>
<i>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> WIPOS</p>
</i>
<p>The perfect hash became the flashpoint for the RIH3 transition into the RI
Search and Rescue squad, complete with German Shepards and St Bernards. A
watershed day for the RIH3, the first time a hasher had become completely lost,
and couldn’t be found anywhere near the trail. Of course we should have looked
in the numerous cabs that work that side of the Sakonnet, but I am getting ahead
of myself.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM), Async, Sex Something, PW, Short Peck,
Oozing, WIPOS</font>, and some virgin joined the hare (<font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO</font>) and were whisked away to the fine trails of the Tiverton Town Woods.
<font color="#FF0000">Bodhisattva Bondo</font> declining to join this weeks hash
as a result of a nasty domestic squabble with <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill
(LAM)</font>, over the position of a toilet seat. Gaytona, who said Gaytona?</p>
<p>The woods, dry as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> humor, have become
the Snake Den of <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO.</font> A capable bit of nature in
a god forsaken part of the State, that has few unique features, allowing the
hares to reset the same run over and over without anyone noticing. The Skunk Den
hashes are significant as the only pretext to entice Rhode Islanders to visit
Tiverton. However, visit before 8:00PM, before the lights are turned off.</p>
<p>The trail led up the hill and down the hill, over dry creekbeds and horse
trail. The FRB’s of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
were caught out at the numerous checks, the pack collapsed together, ran some
power lines then turned back into the woods to hunt for a beer check. A hash
largely uneventful, except for the nasty battle between Baxter and a nameless
skunk. The hash thoroughly appreciated being able to know <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill (LAM)</font> was near . The skunk funk worked better than a cowbell.</p>
<p>The hunt was rewarded with a a check upon a high stone formation, providing a
nice view of Middletown at sunset. <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM)</font>
did not expose himself.</p>
<p>Yada Yada on out as the sun set rapidly, the famous last words of &quot; <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS,</font>
do you have a flashlight&quot; ringing through the woods at the notorious hash
tortoise.</p>
<p>Back out of the woods to the base of that 200 foot tower with red lights (see
a common physical reference here?) circle up, when the reality hits- No <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.
After much jubilation the circle continued, with<font color="#FF0000"> Enema
Bill </font>declaring that we would find <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>-
after finishing the beer. <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>, already on high alert
from having to leave the West Bay, sped off to find <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
along one of the 2 roads in Tiverton. No overly dressed middle aged man with a
walking stick was found.</p>
<p>Back at the circle,&nbsp; the beer was finished and teams set off to find the
missing hasher. Cell phone equipped, and working in pairs, virtually the whole
of the woods were searched without success. All holes were looked into, reveling
nothing more than some potential Boston Hashers. Even the town dump was searched
when someone shouted out that they could smell <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>.
The teams linked up at the beer check, at which time <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>,
who had started the journey with <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>, deserted him
to spend some quiet time in the woods. An alarming display of broken American
Pakistani relations. This desertion also forced <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill</font>
to ride out of the woods with <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>, 4 grown men, 2
large dogs, 1 outsized ego, and 1 funky smell in a Ford Escort. Now approaching
11:30PM,&nbsp; the team knew they would have to seek professional help. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>,
for his part, remained coolly in control of the command point, speaking to an
Uzbeki chicken herder via the shortwave radio.</p>
<p>What happened to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>? According to his
unsubstantiated story, he got lost, walked into Massachusetts and found a
Quickie Mart. He then was able to call for a mystical cab to pick him up in
Tiverton RI at 1100PM , and whisk him back to the starting point for no money.</p>
<p>Rumors quickly started that <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was gone the
same length of time that it would take someone to get arrested for public
indecency (or a similar fashion crime), and get bail. Yet another rumor
circulated that he had used the isolated area to make contact with an emissary
from his home planet.</p>
<p>The Hashit for life is now responsible for a $3,146 bill for Search and
Rescue services. Pay up, or we will take your walking stick.</p>
