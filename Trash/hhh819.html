<blockquote style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #0000ff 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" TYPE="CITE">
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">The inevitable core group 
  of half-minds gathered behind the Parkview Junior High School opposite Roger 
  Williams Park with time to spare. Even <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
  proved that a blind man who habitually ignores d'erections could make it to 
  this location as he arrived 10 minutes early. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
  cracked open some beer and the group awaited the starting time hoping that 
  Ben's howling and whimpering would not attract the police (or
  <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>). It seemed for a while that the cast of 
  characters was to be the same as last week when, with a minute to spare, up 
  pulled <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Just 
  Carole</font> with the virgin <font color="#FF0000">Just Keren</font> (who 
  obviously must have pretty poor judgement to show up with this group). 
  Instructions were given by the hare in what might as well have been some 
  Hindustani dialect for as much as the group could understand them. Then they 
  were off looking for a true Rhode Island trail (&quot;Go to the f*cking Dunkin' 
  Donuts and turn left, you wanks!&quot;).&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">They headed southeast on 
  Park Avenue in search of the Double-D, the gap between <font color="#FF0000">
  Async </font>in the lead and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> in the rear 
  rapidly widening. Turning left on Edgewood Boulevard, the park was entered at 
  an obvious check. The trail led along the eastern shore of Elm Lake with 
  plenty of flour marking the way, almost as if the hare had planned on the 
  presence of inexperienced hashers, virgins, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
  and <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font> It was impossible to get lost. The 
  terrain was such that even <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> could not trip 
  and fall on the carefully graded and cleared paths. There was minimal ice and 
  virtually no mud. What a disappointment for all! Coming up to Edgewood Lake, 
  the runners continued north-northeast hoping against hope that something would 
  liven up the run. A parked car was passed and its occupants appeared not to 
  notice the runners; horns, whistles, dogs, and all. The driver seemed to be 
  resting, while his companion bent over searching for something he must have 
  dropped in the driver's seat. (Your scribe was running too fast to get a good 
  look.) &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">They soon turned west, 
  crossing the bridge at Cladrastis Avenue onto Noonan Island. More clear marks 
  and gentle paths. [It is clear that Horace W. S. Cleveland (a little-known 
  rival of F. L. Olmsted) who designed the park in 1878, did not have hashing in 
  mind as he landscaped the area into a bland and flat terrain of well-drained 
  lawns with orderly ornamental shrubberies and tall straight shade trees. He 
  even gave seven different names to the same lake in an effort to compete with 
  the &quot;Emerald Necklace&quot;.] [You see how boring this hash was, when the scribe 
  has to include details like this to fill out his paragraphs.] In desperation,
  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
  broke into the new Botanical Center hoping to find some bull-briars or poison 
  ivy to run through. A second parked car was encountered by some of the 
  runners. Again, your scribe is not completely certain but the occupants, one 
  on top of the other, appeared to be engaging in spirited CPR practice. The 
  runners continued west, crossing back onto the mainland, and turning southwest 
  along the shores of Cunliffe Lake.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">Soon the trail led off 
  Pine Hill Avenue to the Temple of music. The back of the pack approached the 
  temple uneasily as unearthly sounds could be heard:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&quot;Ob's stürmt oder 
  schneit,</i></font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ob die Sonne uns 
  lacht,</i></font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Der Tag glühend 
  heißOder</i></font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eiskalt die Nacht!&quot;</i></font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">With a sad surmise, it was 
  realized that the brain-damaged <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>had passed 
  into the Temple, thinking it was the Brandenburg Gate. He had had another 
  instant identity switch (as he has had on the last six or seven hashes). He 
  was now SS-Sturmbannfürher von GeBasket, marching along the Unter den Linden 
  to join the Jäger-zu-Pferd regiment N. 2 in '42. A sharp blow to the head from 
  WIPOS's stick and he was back to normal (as if!), and the run continued.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">Leaving Teutonic pleasures 
  behind, they headed south on an isthmus that jutted northeast into Lake 
  Cunliffe. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> noted to <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
  WHO</font>: &quot;I think we've had a beer check here before at the end of this 
  peninsula, the hare wouldn't be so obvious.&quot; A few yards back,
  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> said to <font color="#FF0000">Just Carole</font> 
  and <font color="#FF0000">Just Keren</font>: &quot;We've had a beer check here 
  before, but hares of the RIH3 would never repeat themselves.&quot;
  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>observed to the hare: &quot;Too bad you couldn't 
  use this peninsula for a beer check again.&quot;&nbsp; Running out to the end of the 
  peninsula: the beer check was found! &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">The beer was broached.
  <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> in an effort to welcome the women and 
  virgins and to make them feel comfortable with this crew of manly men, began 
  singing a prolonged version of &quot;I've Got the Clap, Again.&quot; [Actually,
  <font color="#FF0000">Basket's </font>symptoms more closely resemble tertiary 
  neurosyphilis: visual disturbances, dementia, incontinence, abnormal gait, 
  etc. but this is simply medical carping and your scribe apologizes. I am sure 
  he is no stranger to the clap, either.] The virgin got all wet from this, and 
  tried to blame it on Baxter and Jake, returning from their swim. She stated 
  she was originally from Chicago, so naturally &quot;I used to work in Chicago&quot; 
  followed. Finally, recognizing the limited number of escape routes possible on 
  a ten-yard wide peninsula (should the Park Police arrive and somehow object to 
  the boisterous good nature of the gathering), they packed up and headed back 
  south and southwest. &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">
  Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>soon outstripped the 
  rest, who were slowed by the impulse of stopping at a few more parked cars on 
  Frederick Greene Memorial Boulevard to take notes. It is amazing how many 
  legitimate and useful activities can be accomplished in a parked car at night. 
  Your scribe had no idea. Gradually, the runners straggled back behind the Jr. 
  High; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket
  </font>reluctantly leaving the front seat of Basket's car to join the circle.
  <font color="#FF0000">Just Keren</font>, a neophyte at urban public urination 
  technology, went off in the woods briefly. She dug a 2 foot hole, carved a 
  toilet seat cover out of a discarded piece of plywood, killed and skinned 
  three squirrels to create a fur lined seat, and relieved herself. The circle 
  was finally joined in the bushes above the parking area.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">And not a moment too soon, 
  because a car containing a jealous and enraged <font color="#FF0000">Misses 
  Enema Bill</font> drove in, and circled several times before giving up, while 
  the circle hid in fear atop the bluff. The hare in the circle: ratings were 
  genteelly delivered so as not to offend the newcomers: 4F from
  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 6.2 from <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
  (using the New Math), &quot;Delightful&quot; from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
  &quot;No Shiggy&quot;, &quot;Lousy Weather&quot;, &quot;Too Short&quot;, from the rest. Overall: 5.69. 
  Virgin in the circle, questioned by the hare. <font color="#FF0000">Just Keren</font> 
  admitted to a deviant relationship with Just Carole, gave her name (without 
  spelling guidance for the scribe so she gets what the scribe gives, for life, 
  and it's just too bad if I've got it wrong already!), and said her favorite 
  sexual position was &quot;the usual&quot;. This caused some interest to stir through the 
  crowd as <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was not aware that anyone else had 
  that sort of technology available to them, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>
  couldn't believe that the virgin was physically capable of twisting herself 
  that way and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> tried to get the leashes back 
  on his dogs. She did her down down with upwards of 1.4 ounces of beer and sang 
  a popular song that no one knew, so she was drowned out by out-of-tune and 
  ad-libbed obscenities (sung genteelly, of course). Like it or not, she is now 
  a hasher and can expect to get accosted in public places by strangers, shunned 
  by her family and friends, and watched closely by members of the Law 
  Enforcement community.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Just 
  Carole</font> qualified for a visit to the circle based on both the poor-judgement-for-actually-returning 
  rule, as well as the backslider's clause for missing so many intervening runs. 
  After a down down, she started &quot;A Wild Rover&quot;, which <font color="#FF0000">
  Basket</font> took over, mentally translating it into German and back to 
  English again as he sang, with variable comprehensibility (but with tremendous 
  gentility). Hashit was next. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, as the 
  official holder of the hashit for <font color="#FF0000">PW,</font> set his 
  sights on <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS, Async, EverReady,</font> and
  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Your scribe was bored by this time and his 
  always-limited attention span wandered off into the night. He does not recall 
  who ended up with the thing, but will state definitively that it ended up with
  <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>anyways, knowing that in all probability 
  this is a safe guess. Hash religion next, and the ceremony was (genteelly) 
  over.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2">The on on on was in 
  Cranston, and the hare thoughtfully provided hairgum pomade for the harriers 
  and beehive wigs for the harriettes. The venue: &quot;Billy's Frosted Mug&quot;, that 
  welcoming and genteel establishment where they serve their beer in trademark 
  glasses warm from the dishwasher. [N.B. I believe that the source of the name 
  comes from the time Billy got mugged outside of his own bar on opening night, 
  and got really frosted about it. Or perhaps it was cold that night. There are 
  certainly no mugs in the place. Except for the patrons, of course.] At any 
  rate, all except <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> (who was observed driving 
  slowly back into Roger Williams Park) arrived, and found seats. While having 
  pleasant conversations (Thank God Monday Night Football is over!), most of the 
  group enjoyed themselves, that enjoyment not lessened by the fact that
  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>
  spent most of the evening at the dart board.&nbsp; The new hasher
  <font color="#FF0000">Just Keren</font> assured all that she loved every 
  minute of the hash and would definitely return (under her breath your scribe 
  thinks he heard her murmur something about Hell freezing over, but he could 
  not be sure, as the nicotine intoxication from the ambience of Billy's 
  affected his hearing). At any rate, beer flowed, the food arrived,
  <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>put out one of his eyes again playing 
  darts, and the evening ended on a mellow note. </font></p>
