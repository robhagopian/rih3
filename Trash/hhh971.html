<p><font color="#008000">Run #971,</font> November 15, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Uncomfortably close to the Smithfield Police Station.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 30’s, Soggy six inches of snow underfoot.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner, Dr W.H.O., Bondo Jovi, Just Drew, Just Josh, 
Oozing SD, SESYB, WIPOS, Tinker, Async, Just Bert, Seamus, Ben.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The d’erections as usual were ambiguous (to be charitable). But nevertheless, the typical miscreants showed up on 
time, at a convenience store/martial arts parking lot just west of the Smithfield PD. The hare was nowhere to be seen 
at first, but at 6:20 rolled in and parked behind the store parking in the employee lot. The group gathered and 
instructions were given. Once again, they were off.</p>

<p>From the convenience store parking lot, they headed northeast on Rts 5/104 past the Police Department. From 
numerous previous hashes, the next check posed no challenges, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async </font>promptly turned south into the Wolf Hill woods. The Boy Scouts had been busy since the 
Hash’s last trip here. Numerous fresh cut trails were found. The snow was six to seven inches in depth and footprints 
of man and beast were easily followed. At the checks, it was simplest just to take the fork without footprints, as 
the hare had been trying to be cute.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> led at first, heading southeast and east towards the powerlines, but never 
quite reaching them. Some trail bike paths led to confusion and a swamp which moistened the shoes nicely and brought 
the pack back together. <font color="#FF0000">The Just Boys</font> took a long falsie downhill west, and kept going, 
drawing <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> with them.<font color="#FF0000">
Async </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> forged ahead, crossing northwards over Farnum Pike and finally 
onto the powerlines. Trail now duplicated one of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> runs in reverse, descending 
northwest along the powerlines, crossing Capron Rd, and down to a check on the dirt road by Stillwater pond.</p>

<p>At this point the hashers were strung out on and off the trail. <font color="#FF0000">Async, Bondo</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> found true trail heading east along the road, and crossing the ankle deep water 
at the dam at the end of the pond.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Josh</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Drew</font> 
circled around a bit, but eventually followed through the frigid water <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> continued 
on until he was able to find a bridge across, rather than wetting his feet. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
started across the dam, but not seeing any flour for at least three yards, decided to turn back.&nbsp; <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing, SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> unwisely followed his lead.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was probably already at the BC with the hare by now.</p>

<p>At any rate, the confused group that was milling about on and off the dirt road next to the dam eventually realized 
that the dam had to be crossed. They were aided in this decision by hoots of derision from the other side of the pond. 
They made the crossing. They emerged on Stillwater Rd, and turned west. Trail led on pavement to Pond View Ct and 
then reentered the woods, crossing the powerlines to a Trucking depot. They turned southwest and easily found the BC 
under the Rt 116 bridge.</p>

<p>The beer check was remarkably quiet, given the fine acoustics of this oft-used spot. But the hare was too busy 
boasting of his trail to sing. He clearly didn’t comprehend that the only reason it had any merit at all was because 
of the early snowfall. If it had been dry, this would have been a contender for worst trail of the year! As it was, 
it was clearly the worst trail of the week. After some beer from the hare’s thermos containers, they were sent off 
again.</p>

<p>Trail led west along the river briefly. It then curved north into a nicely swampy area where the drying footgear 
was refreshed and the ancient layers of mud cleansed at the dam were renewed. They emerged, appropriately enough, in 
the parking lot of a local gay club, doubtless well known to the hare. Back on the roads, trail led southeast on 
5/104, crossing the river on a nice dry bridge. True trail led through the woods of the Reservoir over the 
partly-constructed new retaining structure. Most of the hashers had had enough of Reservoir running for a while. 
They took the road.</p>

<p>They turned west on the dirt access road south of the river, and picked up trail easily. It led under a 
condominium development onto the condo’s “Nature trail”, and ultimately to a gazebo overlooking the pond. This was 
the site of the circle. The Police Department was visible. Several signs warned “No Trespassing. Police Take Notice.” 
In the distance, a series of sirens coincidentally started as the group gathered. More brilliant planning.</p>

<p>The circle was joined. Ratings were favorable for: good weather and running conditions, near loss of <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, dam 
crossing, and more reservoir activity.&nbsp; Ratings were unfavorable for: the most recycled run in recent memory 
(outside of Woonsocket or Glendale), lack of success at losing <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi, Oozing </font>and 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, pavement in a winter wonderland, lack of arrests, and no beer check in the gay 
club. Total: -0.69. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> who had pleaded sanity and left the circle 
early. That’ll show him! Next, some pathetic efforts at naming:  <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> became 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> for missing the dam crossing, and <font color="#FF0000">Just Drew</font> 
became <font color="#FF0000">Janis Dubya Jerkoff,</font> because this was suggested last week when everyone had had 
too much to drink even though she was not there. It doesn’t get much lamer, and by the time this narrative makes it 
to the Trash, hopefully there will have been a renaming.</p>

<p>On On On was at&nbsp; Box Seats. There is nothing more to say.</p>
