We were lured to the northeast corner of Smithfield by promises ofvirgin territory and a beautiful day for a hash. Of course, as we got there the sun dipped below the trees and a chill permeated the area.Thankfully the hare was able to provide some prelube libations which weenjoyed while getting curious glances from workers at the building under
construction (we were assured by the hare that we were 'cleared' to bethere). At 6:30 the hare regaled us with takes of multiple reces of over
five miles in virgin territory, explained the marks, told us 'the beeris off the trail from the BN about the distance from here to the other
corner of the building', and we were off a few minutes late. Trail waswell marked generally through woods (barely a 'path') and we promptly
got to a whiskey (I believe it was Irish) stop.
<br/><br/>
We set out again and Rusty and Amish (?) took the lead in the quest forthe Captain's Daughter while your scribe, still nursing a sore knee from skiing out west, lagged behind and marked checks for the real laggards. We eventually came out to main path (possibly 'Hanton City Rd') and Ilost track of the two frontr*nners. I promptly came upon a BN with a
tail arrow on the N and, as instructed by the hare and indicated by themark, looked into the woods and saw a flurry of marks. Oddly, thesemarks split into two paths and I took the low one and promptly came uponthe B. A backpack was not terribly hidden and I was delighted to find aCaptain's Daughter within. Cracker Jackoff promptly arrived and we pondered what happened to the frontr*unning bastards. My leading theorywas the split trail from the BN confused them and they managed to end upon the out trail - particularly as trail was so short to this point(barely over 1mi).
<br/><br/>
I believe others filtered in before Rusty finally arrived flushed redwith rage about the marks or somesuch - it wasn't as clear as the marks
were. We wrapped it up and went a short distance back to the cars (grandtotal 1.46mi) ."Rusty finally got his Captain's Daughter.  Basket mounted the machinery for circle and somehowI was nominated for hashit. On-after was at Laura's which was nicelysafe outside.<br/>whiskey stop<br/><a>
