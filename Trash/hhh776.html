</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hare was anxiously pacing when the first of
the pack arrived at 6:15.&nbsp; After a few mumbled instructions regarding the
markings (which were to be in invisible ink activated only by dog urine), the
hare was off, setting live trail through the fresh and rapidly falling snow. [As
an aside, it might be instructive to point out the interesting fact that of the
40&quot; of precipitation in R.I. thus far in the winter of 2000-2001, 39.5 of
them have fallen on Monday nights between the hours of 5 and 9PM.]<br>
<br>
The rest of the lead pack gathered by 6:30, and followed the alpha male <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
W.H.O</font>. until it became apparent that if they continued to follow him,
they would become hopelessly lost as well as wet. The trail led southeast in a
valley, skirting numerous fetid pools of standing water. More than once, they
were confronted by the eternal quintessential choice for a Rhode Island hasher:
to wade through muck, or charge through briars. A check to the left led to a
stream. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. W.H.O</font>.,
suspecting mysterious levitational powers on the part of the hare, crossed the
stream several times, despite the fact that there were no footprints on the far
side. Meanwhile, on the true trail, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was practicing
the minute waltz on his new (non-dermal) flute, while his hounds raced ahead to
get to the beer; incidentally destroying all the hash marks and checks. <font color="#FF0000">Just
John</font>, finding his voice, announced &quot;on-on!&quot; at every clump of
snow on a tree. <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> held back, hoping to
encounter another virgin, or at least a flasher.<br>
<br>
Gradually curving from south to east, a field was encountered.&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font>, thinking the field was another lake, tried to start a bonfire, but
had left his blowtorch at home. <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>,
thankfully, remained fully clothed.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">P.W.</font> had started by this time, and sauntered along
the true trail, aided by the copious footprints of the hapless FRBs. Turning
gradually, a second false trail again led right to a stream. Again, the hapless
(hopeless) leaders made the crossing several times, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
declaring: &quot;Look at all these footprints, there must be someone else out
here.&quot; This seems very likely, given what a lovely evening it was for a
stroll in the woods.<br>
<br>
Back on true trail, a light was seen in the distance, hovering above the
treeline with an eerie beauty, and promise of suds to come. As the pack
approached, it became apparent that the legendary Rhode Island Cliff-dwellers,
the Fugawi tribe, had magically returned to life, and were beckoning the weary
hashers to a better world. Unfortunately, it turned out that <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
had decided to set a fire on a four foot wide ledge, 25 feet above razor sharp
boulders in the valley below. This masterpiece, no doubt a result of years of
wilderness safety training, was soon surrounded by the pack and three large, wet
and horny dogs. The dogs, disappointed that <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
was not yet there with their new stick, tried to uproot the tree that was the
only thing keeping the ledge from falling into the gorge. They then playfully
tried to knock <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> into the fire. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
played a serenade on his new instrument. The rest drank Guinness and Bass Ale.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">P.W.</font> arrived
and joined the sorry bunch.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">P.W.</font> had the
well-behaved dog, so felt somewhat out of place. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
had a new stick, this time crafted of space-age titanium steel, and tried to get
Ben and Jake interested, to no avail. Bondo craftily climbed to the top of the
cliff, and attempted to urinate on the crowd below, but the cold had shrunk his
parts to the point where his stream could not clear his trousers, so he settled
for tossing a few snow balls at <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> (the
largest target). After a while, it was decided to move on. The fire was
extinguished (no small task, given that it had been started with a small core of
nuclear fuel), and the pack split, taking the low road (<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>)
and the high road (the rest) back to the cars and the circle.<br>
<br>
The circle was joined with beer that the hare had procured from a museum in
Boston, each bottle bearing the original signature, in fine quill-pen writing,
of Samuel Adams, as well as the cryptic word: &quot;Reject&quot;. It was pointed
out to the hare that, unlike fine wine, beer is not necessarily the better for
aging. The run was rated with a &quot;Lovely Run&quot; from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
although most had something better than that to say about it. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>was trying to divert attention from his criminal behavior with the Hashit
the previous week, but unsuccessfully. <font color="#FF0000">P.W.</font>
suggested urination on the Hare, and then again on <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.
Unfortunately, with the quality of the beer in the circle, all bladders were
empty. The unusually taciturn pack 'Swang Low', and moved to Swampys for the
on-in.<br>
<br>
Swampys was marked by good beer, good food, and a pretty bartender named Tara,
who was very impressed that <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> had graduated
with the highest temperature in his Medical School class. Overall, it was a fine
night, and even <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>made it home safely without
escort.<br>
