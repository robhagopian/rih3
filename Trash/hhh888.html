<i>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.<br>
Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the Hash;<br>
Most Gracious, Most Merciful;<br>
Master of the Day of Judgment.<br>

Show us the straight way,<br>
The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray.</i></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run: </font></p>

<p>Well, I guess <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> has finally reached that stage of life that we all dread in a Rhode 
Island hasher. That combination of incompetence, senility and laziness so well exemplified by our more senior statesmen, 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. He unmercifully recycled an old hash of his 
and others. He even stole some ideas from the wankers of Newport for this run! Desperation! We can only look for more 
disappointments in the future.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> will probably try to make Tiverton into another 
Glendale, Allah forbid!</p>

<p>But everyone gathered anyways, having nothing better to do on Monday nights. Instructions were brief. The hare promised 
two Beer Checks. He warned of loops and Back Checks. He said something about a Bear check, and a Turkey Trail, but by then 
we weren’t listening.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was tightening his armor seals.  <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> was trying to peer down the front of <font color="#FF0000">SMP’s</font> shirt. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> was trying to get Seamus’s erection to subside before <font color="#FF0000">SESYB </font>got too excited 
herself. I, of course, was reciting the Q’uran after looking at Dr WHO’s bleeding legs. Is it not written that Allah 
created man from CLOTS OF BLOOD! At 6:30 we were off, running south on Highland Avenue.</p>

<p>As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe. 
Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).
</p>

<p>The hare got cute almost immediately. He set a CB 6.9 at the bottom of a bloody long hill, so <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> and I got royally screwed while <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
hang back watching the lazy hare who was walking near the top of the hill. Back up we came and turned right on April 
Lane, and then into the woods. <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>knew almost immediately where he was. He took off to 
the waterfalls where he used to hide and spy on the teenage couples making out. (This was only last year.) But a check at 
the falls had him running around in some cow-pastures. The rest started to follow <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">SMP</font> who took a long falsie along the stream (the “Sin and Flesh” River) downhill.  The hare 
sure got his money’s worth on that hill, as we were wrong again.</p>

<p>I betake me for refuge to the Lord of the DAY BREAK Against the mischiefs of his creation; And against the mischief of 
the night when it overtaketh me; And against the mischief of weird women; And against the mischief of the hare when he 
hasheth.</p>

<p>Finally, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> headed upstream on a path which 
gradually disappeared and became replaced by shiggy. Now the hare set trail with flour so close together that you couldn’t 
miss trail. Whenever a hare does this, he must want to force the hashers along a trail for specific and dastardly reasons. 
This was confirmed when it became clear that he had laid trail crossing the bloody river about fifteen times. <font 
color="#FF0000">Async, Basket</font> and I were too smart for this. We struggled along the banks, through bushes and 
briars, though poison ivy and mud, through nests of ticks, ants and spiders. All to keep our shoes dry. The hare went 
straight though. Half the time, and no scratches.&nbsp; And with delightful cleansing moisture on his Sinning Flesh.
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> got trapped on a log, halfway across the river. He called to warn the others.</p>

<p><i>O Thou, enwrapped in thy mantle!<br>
Arise and warn!<br>
Thy Lord - magnify Him!<br>
Thy raiment - purify it!<br>
The abomination - flee it!</i></p>

<p>Finally, being the great hasher that I am, I found true trail crossing the river again at a check onto a path that led 
back into Ft Barton. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>soon followed, then <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and the 
others as the confusion was finally overcome, mostly by my brilliant trail-craft. The FRBs even blew through a false trail 
mark and rejoined the trail further east, missing a final river crossing by using a bridge. <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> was confident, back in familiar territory, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> started sneering at the 
hare’s choice of shiggy. If I had set this trail, I certainly would have spent a little extra time dismantling the bridges. 
There were far too many!</p>

<p><i>Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind 
ones (To and fro). <br>These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction.</i></p>

<p>The trail curved northward with little of note except some drying mud. We were bunched together when we came to the 
choice of crossing the river again, or following trail off the path towards a large white figure. It soon became apparent 
that this was a mountain goat. You don’t see this sort of thing every day in Glendale! It seemed we were on some sort of 
target range. I quickly demonstrated my valor by climbing into a tree-house blind and having a bit of a wank. The rest 
milled around, playing with various targets on the little-used trails. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> found true trail, which led to the first Beer (Bear) Check. The beer was hidden behind a 5’ 
standing replica of a black bear. Basket meanwhile, was on the wrong side of the river yet again. He was called to 
repeatedly, as well as being warned by the hare. He ignored all.</p>

<p><i>[His] similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, Allah took away [his] light and 
left [him] in utter darkness. So [he] could not see.<br>
Deaf, dumb, and blind, [he[ will not return (to the path).</i></p>

<p>But he finally heeded the calls, and returned to the trail. He loudly worked his way back following trail to the rest of 
us who were enjoying the respite at the beer check.</p>

<p><i>For when there shall be a trump on the trumpet,<br>
That shall be a distressful day,<br>
A day, to the Infidels, devoid of ease.</i></p>

<p>The beer check was remarkable for the fine quality of the beer (a Nut Brown Ale), and the amusing reactions of Seamus 
to a mountain lion statue, as well as to <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> when she attempted to animate the bear in 
Seamus’s direction (and only succeeded in decimating the bear). When we had had enough, the hare directed us to a “T” in 
the trail crossing another bridge. He warned of the Turkey trail without specifying what it meant. Naturally, I 
effortlessly led the hash to a giant plastic turkey in the woods, yet another target. The flour marks reversed themselves 
here. This fact was not noted until <font color="#FF0000">Async, SMP</font> and I had made considerable progress into some 
excellent briars, but we turned around reluctantly to join the rest. We made our way parallel to the river, ignoring a 
few shallow attempts on the part of the hare to direct us back across the river again. The path was reached and trail 
became straightforward for a while. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> led. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was 
in the rear.</p>

<p><i>O ye who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth in parties or go forth all together.<br>
There are certainly among you hashers who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you, they say: &quot;(Allah) did 
favour us in that we were not present among them.&quot;</i></p>

<p>We ran over some hills and I easily mastered some checks with my superior intellect. At a fork with a prominent check,
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> went straight while I knew the true path to beer lay to the left. My cries of&nbsp; “ON 
ON!” were a brilliant beacon to the others. They came like sheep to my calls, except <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
who blew through another false mark and came to the second beer check backwards. We gathered at the beer check atop a rocky 
hill, with lovely forest views and gentle breezes in the waning sunlight. The beer was a nice ESB, a good counterpoint to 
the darker beer earlier in the run. The group began to mellow. Perhaps it was the general loveliness of the setting. Or 
perhaps the effect of two gallons of beer in as many miles.</p>

<p>And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking sense of injury;- behind them will be rivers flowing;- and they shall 
say: &quot;Praise be to Allah, who hath guided us to this (felicity): never could we have found guidance, had it not been 
for the guidance of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing.</font> indeed it was the truth, that the hare of our Lord brought unto 
us.&quot; And they shall hear the cry: &quot;Behold! the beer before you! Ye have been made its inheritors, for your deeds 
(of righteousness).&quot;</p>

<p>Beer finished, the trail out was followed back with only slight confusion at two rather large loops. They were no 
challenge to me of course. Just a few of the others got off track for a while. We came out of the woods up a long staircase 
that led to the observation tower.&nbsp; Up the tower we went, and waited for the hare to bring more beer up. We circled 
having scared away several people who had come to watch the sunset.</p>

<p>[Although one fellow on a cell-phone didn’t seem to be at all bothered by us and stayed up there talking to someone well 
into the ceremonies. He only left when told that if he stayed, he would have to rate the run and he would probably see
<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> ring.]</p>

<p>Between them shall be a veil, and on the heights will be men who would know every one by his marks: they will call out 
to the Companions of the Hash, &quot;peace on you&quot;: they will not have entered, but they will have an assurance 
(thereof).</p>

<p>The run received fine ratings as the sun set over the Sakonnet River and the Narragansett Bay. And it was a fine run, 
although not one of my “seventy-virgin” Paradise runs. A total of +6.9 was given, and the hare submitted to Allah’s 
judgement with another one of his strange and bizarre songs. Async was hashit, for being a backsliding, front-running, 
short-cutting infidel swine. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> having talked Seamus up the tower, found that the poor 
hound didn’t much like the idea of going back down.&nbsp; The hare and the others laughed heartily. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>thought about calling for a hook and ladder. Finally, I stepped in to save the day again, and using my 
mysterious animal magnetism, talked the beast down.</p>

<p>Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant?<br>
Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray?</p>

<p>Off we went for pizza and beer at the Li’l Bear (Beer) Lounge. For $10 we enjoyed pizza and Bass Ale as the evening drew 
to a happy and contented conclusion. All were fulsome in their praises to the hare (and me) for the evening. All vowed 
never to miss another Tiverton hash (unless for some reason, I could not make it). I say: Allah, Subhanahu wa Ta'aala! Hash 
of the Decade! </p>

<p>Verily We have granted thee a manifest Victory:<br>
That Allah may forgive thee thy faults of the past and those to follow; fulfil His favour to thee; and guide thee on the 
Straight Way;<br>
And that Allah may help thee with powerful help.<br>
It is He Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the Hashers, that they may add faith to their faith;- for to Allah 
belong the Forces of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;-<br>
That He may admit the men and women who believe, to Hashes beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye, and remove 
their ills from them;- and that is, in the sight of Allah, the highest achievement (for man),- the Hash.</p>
