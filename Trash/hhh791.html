Bondo(or was he?), ShortPeck, Tinker, Shine-On, TrailHoover(as<br>
Captain America) and yours truly oozing syphilitic dictaphone,and the K9<br>
trio:Ben,Baxter and the GM Jake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<font color="#3333FF"><i>The run:</i></font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">All gathered at 2pm sharp apparently gathered at <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
earlier to have a beer before the run(imagine!) as <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was
late setting the BC, he soon appeared and set us off on our way behind the
school, thru one check and into the woods down trail skirting on the hill high
above the river below as Ben led the trail and ran into some walkers by as trail
led deeper into the woods thru more checks with <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font>
running ahead as trail took the pack across the river and with marks on the
rocks that led back to the same side!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This confused Ben who in anger ran thru <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font>
legs to knock him headlong into the water! Unluckily for the RIH3, it was only
knee deep as they have unsuccessfully tried to sink the Paki who seems to be
showing more resistance than the Eisenhower did! Back into the woods and trail
ran thru pristine rainforests and serpentine trails up and down hills and back
eventually to the river and the BC! Everyone sat in the river and enjoyed
Trinity IPA as Ben made sure all in the pack got a taste of his tail and Baxter
precariously balanced himself in the water as the grand GM Jake sat on the shore
in idyllic meditation (asking himself, &quot;how can I hump <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font>?&quot;).&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000"> Tinker</font> walked to the BC as
it was clear Bondo had skipped the run to bugger off to the ONIN.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;With beer consumed and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>
given the beer to walk to the next BC, the pack was sent on trail as <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font>
took over the lead followed by the ever energetic Ben and the rest of the pack
thru more checks and across the river again on to the other side, the pack
negotiated a dam and down a dirt trail and up a hill back into woods and swamp
with much trampling over boggy marsh and wild cabbage but trail was clearly
marked and out into a street with a check under a huge star n' stripes and into
a maze of construction material where Trail, refusing to follow a superior male
instinct, soon was lost as the pack slowly negotiated its way back to the river
and across, as once again Oozing was taken across by rope and float and <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font> saying how it was pathetic as the water was barely waist deep. The
women: SOHM and TH as well as the K9s also made it across as we waited for <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>
to arrive with the Beer which soon did and was enjoyed and the pack scurried up
the hill and back to the cars...</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;ON IN at <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
and we were joined by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo!, DogMeat</font>, The
mother-in-law, <font color="#FF0000">JoviJuice</font> and Marissa and later by <font color="#FF0000">JustBigShit</font>.
Circle back in the pool but due to dropping temps only <font color="#FF0000">Ooze</font>
and a naked <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> jumped in. Down Downs to the
hare and returnees <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Juice</font> and ...<font color="#FF0000">Bill
the Beak</font>! The hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>for not
missing the run or not having beer at the last run but worse...abandoning the
GM! More songs, beer and food was had by all and overall a great 4th of July...</font>
