The Hounds arrived in ones and two as the clock neared the 6:30 bell. The Hare was nowhere to be found and not having beer to enjoy the weather, we started off in the direction of the first arrow. It was not unlike previous starts from this location, we've been here before, but it was unlike most starts. The weather was dry, cool and very pleasant, a most un-hashlike start.<br><br>
The arrow sent us across the soccer fields to Glen Farm Road and another along the well worn paths leading to the water. Crabby and I came to an intersection where we followed a small stream and the pack was called on behind us. A check sent me uphill to another field, while she followed the trail along the brook and true trail. I continued in a parallel direction, hearing the pack calling on and came out to the waters edge, just as Ass Quack was emerging on the other trail. <br><br>
The Hare set marks along the waters edge then uphill on Sandy Point Ave. A ball busting, long, hard pavement track until an arrow had us running with the cows. Some went right along the electric fence, while the smarter, self-aware  wankers followed the trail of the cows, crossing a small bridge and finding the Hare with his bag of beer. <br><br>
As we started enjoying ourselves with cold beer and singing our ditties, we noticed some wankers missing. Not that we cared mind you, because there was more beer for the rest of us, but we didn't want to be out till midnight looking for them. Eventually all found their way, some just as we finished the beer and started back to the cars.<br><br>
We circled up and enjoyed beers and wedding cake from PH and DP's wedding. DD's were given to the guilty and innocent. We agreed the Hash was fair to middlin and an above average attempt for Fuwangii. The OnOn was held at KJ's pub where we agreed not to steal AQ's personal mug, but I got real close to getting someone else's. Then we went home...that's it.
