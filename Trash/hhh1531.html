Another Donkey&Pubic special. The hares warned us of the distance to travel, briars, poison ivy, and the ball-busting trail. Many heeded to their warning. The aforementioned hapless  did not.
What have we learned? In tribute to the late “Late Night Show with Letterman”, we have:<br/><br/>

TOP 10 REASONS NOT TO GO TO A DONKEY/PUBIC RUN:<br/>
1. Often so far to drive, e.g. this week Atlanta GA<br/>
2. Being so far, Crabby, PG, LB, Crotchy will NOT show up<br/>
<br/>3. Promise of long trail gives hashers opportunity to short-cut, but end up running twice the trail. Ask DR WHO.
4. Basket, WHO, Oozing will always show-up.<br/>
5.Much poison ivy and briars as promised. Ask Glutenless.<br/>
6. Need to brush up on your poetry.<br/>
7. Promises of domestic shite left-over beer e.g. Schlitz<br/>
8. Shiggy.<br/>
9. Eagle & Turkey trail NOT marked when FRBs get there.<br/>
10. Donkey will definitely be there.<br/><br/>

TOP 10 REASONS TO GO TO A DONKEY/PUBIC RUN:<br/>
1. So close to Other kennels, socialize with visitors e.g. Atlanta hash.<br/>
<br/>2. Being so far, light weights will not show-up. You know WHOm you are P.O.P., Foecal Veneer, ArseQuack, Async, Amish etc.
3. Promise of long run gives opportunity to short-cut. Ask WIPOS.<br/>
4. Basket, WHO, Oozing will always show up.<br/>
5. Much briars. Ask Dr WHO.<br/>
6. Read/finish Finnegans Wake, whilst on trail.<br/>
7. Promise of left-over domestic beer e.g. Harpoon & Dogfish IPA.<br/>
8. Shiggy(nice after long hot run)<br/>
9. Not marking eagle/turkey split sends half the hash each way.<br/>
10. Pubic Housing will definitely be there!<br/><br/>

Overall, a good trail in virgin(for RIH3)territory in serene, remote, rocky, wooded forest un-visited by humankind since Bondo’s baptism. Speaking of which, a failed attempt to baptize poor Oozy was thwarted.
Hashit to Oozing. For no particular reason at all.<br/>

OnOn.
