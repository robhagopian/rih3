I am a week late writing this up since Rusty did not give me the signup sheet and Ctrl+Alt+Insert still does not work.<br/><br/>

Here is what I recall from trail:<br/>

        Directions to trail where short and specific, Exit 7 car park. Seems easy to know where to go since we have set trail there a billion times and it was not a hint of virgin territory.<br/>

        Shared a new (401) IPA with the pack, but it is brewed in CT.<br/>

        Amazed how well our shortcut worked and found the beer stop extremely early.<br/>

        Shared a beer with a stranger and tried to recruit. I blame PG for not showing any body part to convince the recruit to cum again.<br/>

That뭩 it, nothing else stands out.<br/>
