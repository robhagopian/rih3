<P>It was a dark and stormy night.&nbsp; No, wait, that's
<BR>another story.&nbsp; This one starts with a short trek to West Greenwich
and
<BR>a turn onto a dirt road off Rte 3 clearly marked with a beaming <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Boom Boom</FONT> and a big HHH sign.&nbsp; Down
the dusty, muddy, bumpy road we went
<BR>with our pristine black cars, while <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT>
carefully (typically?)
<BR>avoided the wet spots along the way.&nbsp; At the end of the dirt,
road <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT>
<BR>was patiently waiting with flour-caked hands.&nbsp; Preset?&nbsp; Yeah,
whatever.
<BR>The run was awesome.&nbsp; A good run to me is one that does not involve
the
<BR>evil flora - Poison Ivy.&nbsp; A great run to me is one that has no
Poison
<BR>Ivy and good beer at the beer check.&nbsp; An awesome run has those
two
<BR>qualities and more.&nbsp; This one had the makings of an awesome run.

<P>The bug-sprayed hounds were off into the woods for a
<BR>shiggyfest in the crocodile-infested swamps and forests of the Big
<BR>Beaver River.&nbsp; With horns blaring and on-on shouted, all the crocodiles
<BR>seemed to vanish as we moved along the trail.&nbsp; Over the river
and
<BR>through the shiggy toward the beer check we hashed.&nbsp; I would talk
more
<BR>about the trail but I decided that the beer check would cum a lot sooner
<BR>if we followed the hare.&nbsp; Besides, a suspicious-looking camp site
was
<BR>nearby in "Deliverance Country" so we shortcutted through different
<BR>shiggy (the shiggy without the leeches), with
<BR>brand-new-white-aerobic-shoes-wearing Live Bait whining the whole way.

<P>At last, the beer check and, of course, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Live Bait</FONT>
and I
<BR>were first in with the hare.&nbsp; There was more whining about the
lack of
<BR>water so the ice chewing commenced.&nbsp; I was happy to find some
nice
<BR>frosty Black and Tans in the cooler <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT>
retrieved from the woods.
<BR>Gee, what else could be hidden in those woods?&nbsp; How 'bout a canoe!!&nbsp;
And
<BR>oars!!&nbsp; And even life jackets!!&nbsp; Async donned his sea-kayaking
life vest
<BR>(complete with a shark-killing knife, flares, nose plugs, and who knows
<BR>what else).&nbsp; The canoe was launched, oars and cushions were loaded,
beer
<BR>was consumed, mosquitoes were swatted, and we waited... and waited...
<BR>and swatted... and swatted... and waited... and swatted... that's enough
<BR>of that!&nbsp; I'm sitting in the canoe where the mosquitoes were fewer
and
<BR>the waiting more bearable.&nbsp; Ok, I was whining a wee bit about
the
<BR>mosquitoes.&nbsp; Who knew that they would completely ignore the two
layers
<BR>of bug spray and one layer of spandex to get a couple of CCs of blood
<BR>out of my ass!&nbsp; At last, the pack arrived.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Jake</FONT>
was a bit warm and
<BR>wanted a swim.&nbsp; In he went.&nbsp; The only way to the run's end
was a short
<BR>canoe ride down the river underneath Rte 95.&nbsp; Several trips were
<BR>required to get the hounds across.&nbsp; So we paddled the first launch
with
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lick It</FONT> at the bow (spilling his beer
as he paddled), me next (trying to
<BR>paddle to keep the boat straight and complaining because <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lick
It</FONT> kept
<BR>switching his paddle from side to side), then behind me was Cleopatra,
<BR>um, I mean <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Live Bait</FONT>, enjoying the ride,
as well as <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ian the Slut</FONT> and
<BR>finally Wilderness Boy <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async </FONT>paddling
at the rear (ok, stern).&nbsp; Finally
<BR>we approached our destination and unloaded the thirsty bodies from
the
<BR>canoe.&nbsp; Off <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT> went to retrieve
the other wankers left behind but not
<BR>before he retrieved yet another cooler from the woods containing more
<BR>beer.

<P>So there we were, alone in the woods at the on-in.&nbsp; At
<BR>least we had beer, good beer, Sam Adams Cream Stout.&nbsp; Did I hear
more
<BR>whining about there being no water?&nbsp; Alas, there was one 16oz
bottle of
<BR>spring water in the cooler, followed by more ice sucking.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lick
It</FONT> and
<BR>I, being two highly-trainined military individuals, proceeded to use
<BR>this time productively and gathered wood to make a fire.&nbsp; The
next
<BR>launch brought the two late cummers <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Evil Bitch
Ripta</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Betty Buttkiss</FONT>.
<BR>They brought with them a story about two fishermen trying to enjoy
a
<BR>peaceful evening of male bondage, uh, I mean bonding.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">EBRipta's</FONT>
version
<BR>of this story is as follows:

<P>"<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Betty</FONT> approached a lake where two "charming"
fishermen
<BR>were fishing and enjoying the peaceful, rustic scenery of West
<BR>Greenwich.&nbsp; One of the fisherman, upon spotting the vision of
lovliness
<BR>approaching, stood up in his boat, his outstretched hand (reminiscent
of
<BR>Michaelangelo's Sistene chapel) was totally bathed in a glowing radiant
<BR>light from the parted clouds, he pointed at <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Betty</FONT>
and loudly proclaimed
<BR>'Bitch!'.&nbsp; Henceforth, Miss <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Betty</FONT>'s
name at the RI hash, now and
<BR>forevermore, has been decreed to be '<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Fishermen's
Bitch'</FONT>."

<P>Anyhoo, eventually all the hounds were gathered together
<BR>once again and after listening to several anecdotes of the various
<BR>hijinks along the trail, the fire was lit and the down-down's commenced.
<BR>We christened a new sacred vesicle, a brass horn which was highly
<BR>conducive to shotgunning brewskis with no problem at all.&nbsp; "Just
stick
<BR>your tongue in the hole, dammit!" I teased, but all the poor horn got
<BR>was a lot of fingering.&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> Lick It</FONT>
drank for being a returnee, Betty
<BR>Buttkiss drank for being a RIH3 virgin, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT>
drank for forgetting to
<BR>bring the Hashit yet again.&nbsp; Yours truly <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Double
Flush</FONT> drank and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">EBRipta</FONT>
<BR>watched for wearing matching shirts (we were sporting our snazzy tie-dye
<BR>shirts from last year's Martha's Madness).&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BBkiss</FONT>
was officially given
<BR>a RIH3 hash name "<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Fisherman's Bitch</FONT>".&nbsp;
Swing Lo was reverently sung.
<BR>On-On!

<P>Being only one steep hill away from the run start, we
<BR>went back to our cars to change into clothes not soaked with beer and
<BR>shiggy.&nbsp; Then back to the fire with the hash hash we started cooking,
<BR>and singing and drinking.&nbsp; The hash hash consisted of delectable
spare
<BR>ribs with sauerkraut and potatoes.&nbsp; It was quite delicious and
I'm
<BR>getting hungry just thinking about it right now.

<P>After listening to <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT>, on Saturday
night,
<BR>complaining about why not many breasts hash with RI, a few Newport
<BR>Harriettes were there in good form and spirit sporting eight of them.
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Jake</FONT> was his usual horny self and was
trying to hump little froggies and
<BR>they scampered by.&nbsp; Both <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT> provided a continuous flow of
<BR>their melodious/harmonious voices but were surprisingly low-key during
<BR>this event.&nbsp; This is the first RI hash I've attended in a long
time
<BR>where I haven't seen a naked man.&nbsp; However, penises were ceremoniously
<BR>released from their confines to properly douse the fire before we left.
<BR>Being a Monday and all, I couldn't tell if they were wanking or peeing.
<BR>I can only remember <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT> shouting, "Hey,
wait a minute, I'm not
<BR>finished yet!"
