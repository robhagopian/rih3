<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location: </font>St Patrick's Church, Broad Street, Cumberland</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather</font>: Low 40's, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">The Slasher Dr WHO, Fuwangi Boner, Bondo Jovi, Oozing SD, 
SESYB, WIPOS, Seamus, Ben, Jake. Visitor: Mr Whipple </font>(?Seoul H3).</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>For the hash closest to St Paddy’s Day, the hare chose appropriate territory: St Patrick’s Church, in the heart of the 
Columbian/Cape Verdean section of Valley Falls. The group gathered along with a large group of people going to Parent 
Teacher conferences at the adjacent school. Somehow, the hashers didn’t really blend in.</p>

<p>The hare called the group to order at the appropriate time, introducing a visitor, <font color="#FF0000">Mr Whipple.
</font> He was a military hasher from the Fart East, recently returned to Attleboro, where exposure to the water supply 
(contaminated thoroughly at <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s </font>last Attleboro hash) had induced sufficient brain damage 
to make him think he wanted to start hashing again. Too bad for him!</p>

<p>Trail led west down a street to an entry into some garbage-laden brambles that would have to pass for shiggy. Marks 
continued into some open and polluted marshland as the Blackstone was approached. But there was enough moisture to 
guarantee at least a slight dampness of the feet. A check led north and crossed under the Rt 123 (John Street) Bridge. 
They curved along the riverbank as it turned slightly east. The marks disappeared.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, 
Fuwangi,</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> crossed up to the road to look for flour.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> saw a tunnel emptying into the stream and entered, followed by the hare. They 
passed under a spewing drainpipe, likely connected to the public toilets in Ann and Hope. The hare then declared an 
“Usquaebach” Check, and produced a flask with some Irish whiskey. Having duly passed this from Hare to <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO </font>to <font color="#FF0000">Mr Whipple</font> to <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, they 
returned, ignoring the possibilities opened up by the narrowing tunnel and deepening water. Trail resumed along the river, 
and came up to the RR tracks, where the rest were milling about, and were chastised for missing the check.</p>

<p>Trail was resumed, with little excitement except for the progressive loss of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, who 
has become more and more disgusted with the simple act of physical locomotion in any form. West off the tracks and then 
south on the Rt 122 (Mendon Rd) bridge crossing the river, they went back into the brush on the west side of the river. 
The beer check was just under the Rt 123 bridge (John St, but the opposite side) and was combined with the circle (an 
alarming trend which must be curtailed!).  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> drank alone in his car.</p>

<p>Ratings for the Run: Good shiggy, hashers missing Whiskey Checks in Tunnels, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> wanking 
back to the cars: total: +6.9! Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> for hashing the previous day in Boston, and 
not showering since (Hey! It’s not Saturday, yet!). They sang and had religion, then crossed the bridge and ran back to 
the cars.</p>

<p>On On On was at the Lodge in Lincoln. There was no room in the bar, so they were forced into the dining room, resulting 
in the rapid departure of the remaining clientele in this area. Alone they ate and didn’t even bother to “Alouette” their 
waitress, or steal beer from a State Policeman. They contented themselves with throwing popcorn into each other’s beers 
and avoiding paying for the meal. Another typical night with the RIH3.</p>
