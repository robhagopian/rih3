<p>Ahoy, ye wanks! I be th’ secret scribe this week! Read along and see if ye can guess who I be. I was asked by <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> to take over. It bein’ my favorite holiday, International Talk Like A Pirate Day, and all; 
and bein’ that I had to pick up someone at the Aaarrport, ‘twas mighty convenient-like. After all, our 
Commander-in-Chief be celebratin’ this day as well. Aaarr!</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1016/01.jpg"><br><br>A born hasher. Aaarr!</p></center>

<p>At any rate, th’ scurvy lot o’ scalawags met at a paaarrkin’ lot overlooking Greenwich haarrbor. The virgin hare, 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish It Head</font>, provided some pirate headgear for all, but nary a parrot nor eyepatch was 
seen. Avast there, matey, ye’d do well to improve upon this next year! A new visitor/transplant came aboard: <font 
color="#FF0000">Dick Dock (the B*tch gives head)</font> ‘twas her moniker. Aye, an’ we’ll see if she shows up again! And 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Kari</font> came back for seconds. She soon was wishin’ she’d strung hersell from her own 
yaaarrdaaarrm, ye can wager. Aaarr! Some instructions, and they were off, wi’ following winds and fair seas as they 
tacked nor’ by east on Crompton. Pavement! Aaarr!</p>

<p>Trail was found turning east to the shore thru a Water-Filtration Plant. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had seen flour from th’ bluffs o’ the paaarrkin’ lot. But they had still followed 
the noise o’ <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> as he turned down t’ th’ haarrbor. Trail turned back right under the 
parking lot. Aye, they’d been right hornswoggled! But the flour led sou’west to a “BN”! Begad! Hash o’ th’ year! 
Unfortunately the hare, a poxy lubber if ever there be one, called them back frantically. Aaarr! He should ha’ followed 
his own map!</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1016/02.jpg"><br><br>The hare’s map o’ East Greenwich. Aaarr!</p></center>

<p>Tryin’ again, they climbed back out to Crompton, and turned sou’west. They crossed some RR tracks on Rocky Hollow, 
and at a check <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> found true trail in some bushes 
along the train tracks. They turned up through a break in some hedges to a paaarrking lot. Sink me, but there were loads 
o’ lubbers getting’ out o’ their cars. These same shuddered in fear as the crew o’ motley privateers ran through, 
shoutin’: “No quarter!”, “Pieces o’ Eight!” and o’ course: “Aaarrr!” Most reckoned as they ran through that ‘twas some 
kind o’ tavern. But as they came to the front it was clear that th’ only eatin’ at this place was done by the worms o’ 
death. ‘Twas a right funeral paaarrlor! Shiver me timbers! Aaarr!</p>

<p>They sallied forth crost Main Street, and entered a quiet sort o’ neighborhood. Lovely yaaarrds, and all! Not that it 
was quiet for long, me Buckos! The checks and maaarrks were now in blood! (Or possibly pink chalk. No matter, ye could 
not see them in the wanin’ light to save yer life! Aaarr!) There were checks and more checks, pavement and more 
pavement; streets wi’ exotic names recallin’ the South Seas! Names like “Second Street” and “Fourth Ave” and th’ like. 
Jibbooms and Bobstays! Finally, the checks led out (One-eyed) Reilly Ave, to Cragan Field. Well, me beauties, they came 
on led by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, surprising some landlubbers at th’ 
battin’ cages. Aaarr! <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turned t’ port. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> turned t’ 
staaarrboard, and led <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Kari</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dick Dock</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was already becalmed back in th’ numbered streets. 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was runnin’ with th’ wind abaft th’ beam, back to his car for some grog. <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were tryin’ t’ short-cut, th’ lily-livered 
bilge-rats! Aaarr! True trail ‘twas nor’east, through East Greenwich Cemetery.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> had aaarrived, back at th’ lot. In spite o’ th’ darkness, he managed to find 
his way into th’ closing ceremonies o’ th’ funeral. Aaarr! But he had no pirate garb. He made it to th’ numbered streets. 
Meanwhile, the rest o’ th’ benighted corsairs shifted crost the Cemetery, and back onto pavement. They continued across 
Rt 401. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> found a check. “Twas the last maaarrk any would see for a while, bedad! On 
straight he ran, close-hauled and smaaarrtly. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
turned t’ staaarrboard. They were on th’ true, and didn’t have a clue. But th’ hare, th’ bilge-sucking blaggaaarrd, 
followed halfway down th’ hill and turned the pack nor’east, leavin’ <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> to their own mischief. Aaarr! <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> caught up with <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. They were lost for sure, now, me hearties!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> ran nor’east on Main, not hampered in th’ 
least by maaarrks or other confusions. They heard whistles ahead, and to port. Th’ pack was cruisin’ parallel, on th’ 
hill above. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> turned back up th’ hill on Pierce, followed by <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font>. They found a check. They saw the pack. The hare was leadin’ back down th’ hill. All on blasted pavement! 
Aaarr! Finally, they met on Main, and continued nor’east to Queen. Turnin’ staaarrboard, they came down upon th’ Oak 
Tavern. And <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, th’ scurvy dog! He’d found th’ booty! Beer check! Aaarr!</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1016/03.jpg"><br><br>Maaarrk ye these words! Aaarr!!</p></center>

<p>And ‘twas a fine Beer Check! No <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>! Two 
pitchers! Wenches! And one snaggle-toothed doxy who came over to compliment th’ crew on their appearance at th’ funeral. 
Seems she had been there and thought th’ pirates an entirely appropriate entertainment for th’ bereaved. Bein’ that the 
deceased (rest his soul!) had worn an eyepatch, and all! Aaarr! P’raps this be why the chanteys and songs were not 
forthcomin’ from the jack-taaarrs. Unusual attention ‘twas paid to th’ Red Sox game. Aaarr!</p>

<p>The trail from th’ BC , aye, ‘twas rare painful. The hare promised more flour, but delivered more hills! North on 
Main, then a west circle-jerk on Church. This was so’s to pass through some more yaaarrds and ballfields, as a pretense 
at shiggy. More pavement! Keelhaul the hare! Aaarr! There may’ve been flour now, but twas too daaarrk in th’ field to 
see. The hare led on. Rector street north to Division, east down to Main, north to Ladd, east to Duke, south to King to 
Exchange to Queen. Th’ pack was mighty confused. They passed th’ Oak Tavern again. Seein’ this, th’ baaarrrkeep became 
mighty confused. But the pack was not amused when it became clear that there’d be no stoppin’ a second time on the hare’s 
doubloons! Aaarr! Continuin’ sou’west on Duke to London St, where a pirate tunnel led ‘neath th’ railroad. They emerged 
on Crompton, and skippin’ over th’ Water Treatment circle jerk, they came to th’ cars. Awaitn’ were <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had finished 
his own brew. So <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had broken into th’ hare’s car. They had nearly finished his beer. 
Aaarr!</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1016/04.jpg"><br><br>Basket’s True Nature Revealed. Aaarr!</p></center>

<p>They all made for th’ shoreline o’ the haarrbor now, moon and tide both arisin’. The circle was formed at waters edge. 
Did I mention th’ tide? Aaarr! Ratin’ th’ Run: pavement, lack of shiggy, the presence of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> ‘twere powerful arguments against a goodly ratin’. But: new wenches, 
total confusion of marks, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> at the Beer Check, 
funeral disruptions, and the tide, now up to th’ ankles o’ the rascals, could not be gainsaid. Total: <b>+69!</b> Aaarr! 
Hashit: ‘twas a foregone conclusion. Only <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> could miss th’ beer check and have th’ 
cheek to boast about it. The newcomer and two-timer were questioned, and ‘twas suggested that they walk th’ plank. But 
th’ plank was by now underwater. The ceremonies were cut short, and they swang low, water at the mid-pegleg.</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1016/05.jpg"><br><br>Proper gaaarrb for th’ end o’ a Pirate Circle. Aaarr!</p>
</center>

<p>On On On ‘twas at (Deadeye) Dicks on Post Rd. near th’ aaarrport. ‘Twas a typical outing, with beer spillage, 
thievery, looting and pillaging. A buxom strumpet at th’ bar offered a shot o’ Captain Morgan, piteously begging that we 
stay th’ flood o’ song. She received her due: a right long Alouette, and a right pathetic Heigh Ho! Aaarr! So finishin’ 
up, off into th’ night they drove to their various hideaways and haunts. Leavin’ me, your poor scribe to tell the tale. 
Do ye not yet know who I be? Well, here be a picture to help ye reckon:</p>
