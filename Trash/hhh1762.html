Christmas in Newport Hash<br/>
Date: 12/9/2019<br/>
Hare: F' oThe Irish<br/>
Hashers: Rusty: WIPOS: Basket: PG; Scooner; Oozing; Crotchy; AssQuack<br/>
Second timer: Just Joe<br/>
START: The mansion at 100 Rhode Island Ave<br/>
WEATHER: Nor'Easter, but warm in the 40s, drenching rain throughout, ensuring only the brave, OR foolhardy would show up.<br/><br/>

The fools did show up, one by one, running late due to delays for aforementioned weather. As well Google Maps sending most to an address other than the start. Just Joe, who's abode we started from, had paid bribe money to send the either the DEA, or jilted girlfriends, or possibly Bondo, on a wild goose chase.<br/>
The pack congregated in the foyer of the castle-mansion, and were informed the hare set off on a live trail as previous marks were washed away.<br/><br/>

At 6:45PM, pack away, as they SWAM down RI Ave to the first check. Rusty, Just Joe, Schooner and AQ were off in a jiffy! A left turn, then a right on Francis St, then down Kay and right on Bell St to Broadway to Fastnet. The beer check? Nope!
Trail went south on Washington St and to Eisenhower Park. Here Basket, PG, WIPOS and Oozing congregated around the large Xmas tree and broke-out into impromptu hash-caroling. Expecting whiskey or cheers, the choir was met with boo's and quickly set on trail again.<br/><br/>

Down to Memorial, check near the baseball park, and across to the BC at the train station, with soggy orange food enjoyed by all.<br/>
More hash carols followed, then the pack head(WHO said?)-ed back to the start.<br/>
At the castle, Crotchy waited with the unlikely story of not being able to find trail. Most likely just being smart and decided NOT to venture out into the torrential downpour.<br/>
Soon the pack minus WIPOS circled in the back of the house.<br/>
Comments included "great shiggy", "no wipos", "too far to drive"(Rusty and AQ); mathematical total 6.9.<br/>
Down-downs for Just Joe.<br/>
Oozing got hashit for no particular reason.<br/><br/>

The OnIn was at Pub at Two Mile including Rhode Islands voted best chicken wings.<br/>
Decent beer on tap.<br/>
A Whiskey shot to celebrate Baskets birthday was had by all, before calling it a night.<br/>
A good night had by all.<br/><br/>
