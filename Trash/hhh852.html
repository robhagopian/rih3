<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Raging Queen,</font> the hare, 
is known for hash d'erections of extraordinary incompetence, even for the RIH3. 
It was with an uneasy feeling then that the group arrived following 
straightforward and accurate directions to the start. [Only
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> made a wrong turn. He went into Camp 
E-Hun-Tee. He was reluctant to leave when he discovered that this camp was the 
RI residential wilderness treatment program for troubled teen boys, aged 11-16. 
And what cute boys they are.] But the usual crowd gathered eventually. A 
surprise visitor, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, appeared in full hash 
gear with headlight cane, looking ready for anything. <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Matt</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Murph</font> returned from CT to show 
their support for the hare, obviously using very poor judgement. Just Jake 
continued his streak. <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> recalled the hare's previous efforts and wisely 
stayed on the Cape. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had entered WankFest 2002 
in the Female Impersonator Division, and was appearing in New Orleans as 
Rosemary Clooney singing &quot;Come On-a my Hash&quot; accompanying himself on the 
ukulele.</p>

<p>After all had a beer from the hare's new Rolling 
Rock cooler, the hare gave hash instructions. The marks were unashamedly shown 
to be worthless. Check marks could be represented by virtually any flour pattern 
that the hare's sick imagination could produce. False trails were never to be 
marked and could have as much flour or T.P. as the hare felt like at the moment. 
Excuses were made about getting lost and having to shorten trail. A short trail, 
domestic 'beer' and pathetic marks. <font color="#FF0000">The Queen</font> had 
indeed been raging, and the evening promised to be special. Shrugging 
fatalistically, the crew took off.</p>

<p>First marks led south on the west bank of the Flat 
River. <font color="#FF0000">Just Jake</font>, trying grimly to get this farce 
over with, sprinted ahead as the trail led away from the river. Turning west 
into the mild shrubbery, the Wood River was encountered and flour indicated a 
crossing was needed. <font color="#FF0000">Just Jake</font> acted quickly. He 
entered the river and took an unwitnessed header into the water.
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> followed the bank hoping to avoid the stream 
if a cute 'double cross' had been planned by the hare. The rest followed
<font color="#FF0000">Just Jake</font>. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> found 
the same hole that had tripped up Just Jake. His swim was witnessed with 
considerable lack of sympathy and derision. All eventually crossed and 
continued.</p>

<p>They ran west and north along the Wood River, 
crossing again a few times, and ending up on the northeast bank. The trail 
bushwhacked to a road, crossed and moved slightly uphill. The sides of
<font color="#FF0000">Mt Tom</font> were reached but the hare, apparently 
running low on T.P. by this time ignored the steep cliffs of this mighty peak. 
The erratic trail was easily followed because of the excessive use of this 
substance, and the trail turned east, crossed the river once more, and proceeded 
uphill to the Beer Check. Did I mention that this was a short trail?</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had ignored the 
marks altogether and rode his bike up the road directly to the Beer Check. He 
was still late, that's how short the trail was. <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font> had found a mysterious shortcut, and FRBs <font color="#FF0000">
Just Matt, Just Jake</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Murph</font> arrived early 
to discover a collection of two or three Harps, and the better part of a case of 
Rolling Rock. (Actually, the better part of a case of Rolling Rock is the 
cardboard box. But I digress.) <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>heard the 
sounds of opening cans in the distance and turned back on trail with a shudder. 
By the time the rest arrived, there was only one choice in beverage. There were 
some unhappy hashers, I can tell you. These efforts on the part of the 
Connecticut crowd to bring the RIH3 down to their sordid and cheap level of beer 
consumption must cease. There could only be one response. A rousing chorus of &quot;Singin' 
in the Rain&quot; with special effects provided from the glass-lined tanks of old 
Latrobe. More suitable use has never before been made of a case of Rolling Rock.</p>

<p>After a brief attempt at &quot;Singin' in the Hail&quot; 
(using the ice left when the beer was gone) resulted in another eye injury to
<font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font> So they called it quits and left and ran 
the half-mile or so southeast on dirt road, back to the cars. Some of the FRBs 
changed into dry clothes. Then the circle was called. In the middle of the Flat 
river. The water was slightly cold so <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>
thoughtfully whizzed off about two liters off the bridge upstream, warming the 
group nicely. [Where he came up with this volume is a mystery. The rest were so 
dehydrated from the absence of Beer at the Beer Check, that they couldn't 
produce a drop. Your scribe believes that there is a secret store of Bondo-brew 
hidden in the frame of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's </font>bike. Why else does 
he always ride at hashes these days? Everyone else thinks he can't run because 
of his lumbago, but your scribe will be bringing a hacksaw and a straw to the 
next hash.]</p>

<p>The circle was joined with the hare waist deep, 
surrounded by bubbles of swamp gas or something else. Ratings were generally 
incomprehensible, because most thought they had only run the first half of a 
hash. Clear weather, lack of beer, short trail, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>at the BC; how could this run receive 
positive scores? It was only the considerate and charitable good nature always 
found in the RIH3 that allowed an overall -0.69. [And judging by the past, when 
the <font color="#FF0000">Queen</font> gets lost setting trail, he will repeat 
himself the next time. This is actually a brilliant and innovative strategy. Why 
work at setting new trail each time you are the hare? Set the same one twice in 
a row! You can cut your work in half.&nbsp; But I digress.]</p>

<p>Hashit was awarded several times, with mixed voting 
for the perpetual hashit <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, or for the urinary 
bike hasher <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. It ended up with
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, for the crime of trying to divert attention 
from himself and trying to avoid the hashit. He was reluctant to accept the 
award. Thus <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> tied it to his car, where it was 
dragged unceremoniously to the on on later that evening. Finally exhausting the 
possible sources of amusement found standing in a semi-circle in a river 
splashing each other, they swung low and made ready to go to dinner. It wasn't 
even 8 PM.</p>

<p>The on on on was at Mark's, the Cady's of Coventry. 
All attended except <font color="#FF0000">Murph </font>and <font color="#FF0000">
Just Matt</font>, who felt that this place had too much class for them. The 
table was marked 'reserved', although the owners were disappointed that they had 
to throw away the bushel of grilled vegetables that they had prepared in 
anticipation of <font color="#FF0000">Async's</font> presence. Hot Buffalo wings 
were ordered, in clear violation of the RIH3 anti-appetizer statute.
<font color="#FF0000">Just Jake</font> was inspired to order 50 of these 
'Chernobyl-hot' buffalo wings as his main course, resulting in a temporary and 
provisional naming: &quot;Buffalo Boner&quot;.&nbsp; Naturally this provoked some singing, and 
the end result:</p>

<p style="margin-left: .25in">
Buffalo Boner, Half-Mind Hasher<br>
He is de Buffalo Boner <br>
Lost on trail in Arcadia<br>
Comin' from URI, he'll wind up in ACI <br>
Hashing on arrival, hashing for survival</p>

<p style="margin-left: .25in">
I mean it, when I analyze his stench <br>
To me, it make a lot of sense <br>
How a basket of hot-wings, make him do some stupid t'ings</p>

<p style="margin-left: .25in">
And he was taken from Providence, got no common sense <br>
Hashing on arrival, hashing for survival<br>
Said he was de Buffalo Boner, Half-Mind Hasher <br>
Buffalo Boner, in de heart of Arcadia</p>

<p style="margin-left: .25in">
If he had just half a brain <br>
Den he would never go hashing again <br>
Den he wouldn't have to ask me <br>
&quot;Where the f*ck do you think I am?!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left: .25in">
He's just a Buffalo Boner<br>
Lost in Arcadia <br>
Can't seem to find trail, shoulda tried Glendale <br>
Said he was hashing on arrival <br>
Hashing for survival <br>
Said he was de Buffalo Boner <br>
Run de hash for de hot-wings</p>

<p style="margin-left: .25in">
Dreadie, On on on, On on on, on on on on-on on-on on<br>
(repeat)</p>

<p>was so depressing that this naming was judged to be 
void by all present. Apparently, white men can neither jump nor sing reggae. 
However, a woman playing with some balls (at the billiard table) came over 
several times with some requests for songs (&quot;Do youse know any Simon and 
Gahfunkel?&quot;). Many songs were sung, food was consumed, beer was mixed with malt 
vinegar or salt, and all enjoyed themselves, at least until the exorbitant bill 
arrived.</p>
