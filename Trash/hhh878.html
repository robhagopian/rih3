<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Little Big Frozen River<br>

<p>This could start with “It was a dark and dreary 
night”, or “Too cold for man nor beast”, or better yet, “what the heck are we 
doin’ here?” I was feeling was a bit like Ronald Coleman holding Jane Wyatt with 
the rest of the crew from the Lost Horizon, and suddenly discovering Shangri-La 
was not over the next bend, unless of course there’s beer at the end of the Ice 
Rainbow.</p>

<p>And so without trepidation this band of silly willys 
set out on a trail set by a banker, who has so little sense that he paddles a 
kayak across Narragansett Bay in a March gale. The snow was deep. How deep you 
ask? Well it brought to mind lots of words, if I were Laboradoran Inut, I’d say 
for ice ‘sikko’, bare ice ‘tingenek’, snow (in general) ‘aput’, snow (like salt) 
'pukak ', soft deep snow 'mauja', snowdrift ‘tipvigut', soft snow 'massak ', 
watery snow ‘mangokpok ', snow filled with water 'massalerauvok ', soft snow ‘akkilokipok’. 
But I’m not so I just said fuck. It’s too deep, and cold, and why are we out 
here when we could be in Marks, or Morks?</p>

<p>Well, we had no igloo, nor sense for that matter, so 
the hare pointed us to the first marks. The trail led us into some thick woods 
and out to a snow covered (da) sand pit (da), that led us on a not so merry 
circle-jerk&nbsp; (da da), crossing the road and along trails through Big River.&nbsp; It 
all seemed too familiar, but then again, there ain’t much left in Rhode Island 
we ain’t hashed on.</p>

<p>The big pines left patches of soft snow underneath, 
but we traveled on trails packed down from snowmobilers, then rained on, and 
finally refrozen into a sikko massalerauvok. We slipped and slid and twisted 
ankles and such until we finally made our way to that swamp. Remember the one 
where <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had his canoe on the other side and let 
us ride across like a bunch of Mary’s. Well, today he didn’t bring his canoe, so
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>started out to the right. First sound was 
“SPLASH”, as he cracked through the ice into the frigid river. Second sound was 
“SHIT” as it passed his knees and hit his boys. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> 
tried the right approach, much with the same results. The two were standing 
waist deep; when I tried to keep upon the clumps of frozen grasses, crashing 
through to my crotch. It was cold, I’ll say.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was thinking the 
whole thing over, talking with the hare to discover why we had to cross right 
here, and like a bolt of icicle it hit him. Beer was on the other side. Without 
hesitation, he dropped to his belly, pushed his cane out in front of him, and 
slithered to the other side.</p>

<p>We must have looked like a sorry lot, with him on 
the beer side of the river, and us up to our arses. We’re the wet ones, and he’s 
havin’ a cold one. It didn’t take much for the rest of us to slither, one by 
one, to the other side. Well, a few had some doubts. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
looking quite astonished that besides some small cracking of the ice,
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> crossed over without crashing through. Then 
late cumers <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">ERSB7</font> 
arrive, and the looks of disbelieve soon left their faces as fear painted a 
bleak picture across their faces.</p>

<p>The last ones to cross were the three Lascivious 
Lizards slithering like a cheap B movie. Quiet the sight and sounds. They were 
making all kind of sounds we usually associate with warmth, beds, and bodily 
fluids, but they way they wiggled, hmmmmmm. All of us made it over, and we had 
beer and there was much jubilation. The OnOn was at Mark's, where food, beer and 
entertainment from the Lounge Lizards made our evening complete.</p>
