<font face="Arial" size="2">The group gathered relatively promptly at the
no-parking area of Liberty Road at the northeast corner of The Great Swamp
Wildlife Reservation. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> chose an alternative
approach pattern, and only two successive Acela trains, passing at 120 mph,
convinced him not to drive across the tracks to join everyone else who had just
followed the directions to the start. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> gave up
before the start, and announced his intention to enjoy the weather with a lovely
bike ride. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was prepared for anything, with
surgically attached toilet-seat-hashit, and shorts guaranteed to disguise any
embarrassing accident.<font color="#FF0000"> Dr. W.H.O</font>., still smarting
from his injuries the week before in Cranston, had fashioned nipple-protectors
from Harpoon beer bottle caps. Visitors and virgins were abused appropriately.
The hare appeared sweating, and bleeding profusely from scratches on his shins.
A promising start, until it was realized that his sneakers were totally DRY!
With no instructions except to keep our!<br>
&nbsp;&quot;peanuts&quot; off the railroad track, the pack was released.<br>
<br>
Heading back west on Liberty Road, the pack realized that in keeping with the
&quot;Conservation of Flour&quot; program instituted in 2001, the virgin hare
had reached new heights in powder-free hashing. A mystical check appeared out of
nowhere on the old Narragansett Pier Railroad spur, now a bike path. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
excited by the form fitting seat on his mountain bike, sped off into the
distance with a hearty &quot;On-on!&quot;, leaving the rest of the pack
careening in circles though a mares nest of trails, most of which had one and
only one clump of flour on them. Through some fields, turning south and west
until they reached: THE CARS! Still DRY! It was not over yet, however.<br>
<br>
The trail now led southwest on the road next to the railroad tracks, past the
first substantial obstacle on the trail: <font color="#FF0000">Just Bubba</font>.
<font color="#FF0000">Just Bubba</font> was a large, somewhat sour young lad,
who clearly did not approve of the hashing style of running, and expressed
concern that the hashers might prove disruptive to the nesting birds and swamp
faeries. A description of the mating habits of the Rhode Island Red Cock did not
reassure him, and off he went to call the DEM police. [His quick wit allowed him
to discern that the hashers were on the trail of something extremely rare and
precious: a white powder on the ground that could only be seen under special
circumstances, in minute quantities. <font color="#FF0000">Bubba</font> knew
what to do. He was later seen walking in circles in the swamp, a straw in his
nose, powder on his face, suffering from acute semolina overdose.]<br>
<br>
Down the road the hapless bunch went. <font color="#FF0000">Wet Nuts, Just Tom,
Shags Well</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Just Chris</font> were FRB's,
showcasing the stamina of the regulars of the RIH3. <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> followed, hampered by the
desire to at least partly inspect the falsies found at the frequent checks. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
reappeared, smelling of Stuffies and Clamcakes, and shot to the front, never to
be seen again until the mosquitoes drove him back to his van. <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font>
likewise, never made it past <font color="#FF0000">Bubba</font>, and he and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
contented themselves in <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> van doing God knows
what until the pack finished the trail. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>,
adjusting his mosquito netting, followed, observing all. [By God, he should be
the scribe!] Discovering the missing remnants of the markings, the hare gave
directions to the first beer check, and then gave the FRB's the beer, shaken not
stirred from riding out the last three miles on his shoulders in a backpack.&nbsp;
The hare went off to collect stragglers, while the beer was opened and shared,
resulting in the precipitous intoxication of several hundred mosquitoes and wood
ticks. Still DRY, though!<br>
<br>
The trail resumed; the frequent, unnecessary false checks resumed, and they were
headed for the second beer check. Northeast on the powerlines, then north on a
powerline substation spur. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, desperate for
shiggy, began to flagellate his legs with thorns, until forcibly restrained by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.
The second beer check was found. By now dusk was at hand, the mosquitoes had had
enough beer, so the second stop was enjoyed in relative peace.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Just
Chris</font>, attempting to qualify for hash naming, told jokes that were stolen
from old Reader's Digests. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Shags
Well</font> told Marine Jokes, hoping to provoke the USMC's <font color="#FF0000">Wet
Nuts</font> into a killing frenzy, trusting that <font color="#FF0000">Just
Chris</font> would be one of the casualties. Unbelievably, still DRY! Finally,
on-on into the night, north to the road, and northwest back to the cars.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
reluctantly quitted the steamy van, and joined the circle on the wrong side of
the tracks. The run was rated: &quot;Best ever&quot; and &quot;Worst ever&quot;
from the virgin, 3F from <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> &quot;Probably
beautiful&quot; by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, &quot;Where's the
shiggy?&quot; from <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, &quot;My shoes are going
to lose their aroma, because they're DRY&quot; from <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>,
and &quot;My nuts aren't wet yet&quot; from <font color="#FF0000">Wet Nuts</font>.
The numeric score totaled +0.69, with the Romanian judge abstaining in protest.
Songs were sung, no rings were seen, and the hashit was fought for in a most
unseemly manner by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
who both deserved it for unnatural acts in a van with three dogs, and remaining
DRY throughout.<br>
<br>
The On-in was a complex affair: starting at the nearby house of <font color="#FF0000">Long
Dong</font>(?) and his wife
(She-who-was-once-named-but-who-wouldn't-reveal-her-name) where most of the
group repaired to cadge some free beer, and traumatize some young children. Then
to Champions on Rt 1, where <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was found eating
rabbit food (the day's special). <font color="#FF0000">Wet Nuts</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just
Tom</font> disappeared in disgust, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> in a huff;
the rest found their way to the Oak Hill Tavern south of Wickford, where giant
cook-your-own rib-eye steaks were provided, with salad and potato, as well as 23
oz Guinesses. A fine meal, indeed. The virgin hare may have been a DRY
bushwanker, but the evening was a success for all.<br>
<br>
On-on<br>
