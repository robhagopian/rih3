    <font color="#008000">Run #</font>1341 Dec 12, 2011<br/><font color="#008000">Hare:</font> WIPOS<br/><font color="#008000">Location:</font> Seekonk Public Library<br/><font color="#008000">Weather:</font> Cold<br/><font color="#008000">Scribe:</font> Wee Balls<br/><font color="#008000">Present:</font> Hashers and Dogs<br/><font color="#008000">The Hashit:</font> Wee Balls<br/><br/>The Run:<br/><font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> let <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> out of the dog house? Why did I cum to another <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> hash? And why is <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> not at the start of the hash? These are only a few of the questions that we all where thinking. <br/><br/>From the parking lot we headed east on to nicely groomed trail, curved around into the shiggy and up a large embankment. The first thing noticed was the large amount of flour distributed on trail. The Hare must&nbsp;have learned something in the dog house, needed to redeem himself or is turning over a new leaf. Until we turned North and looped back around South to dead end at the water. As we all searched high and low for trail another question popped into the mind. Did <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> pull another <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> and not complete his trail? Before the question was answered ON-ON was heard, in the opposite direction of DOB who was on the other side of the lake, go figure. <br/><br/>At this point we where weaving in and out of trees collectively finding trail. We then hit a check, pack went left to find marks and pavement. Strolling down the pavement we encounter large dogs and hear a horn to our rear (insert joke). No one thinks twice about ON back, because we all think it is <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> and the first rule of the RIH3 is to never follow or listen to<font color="#ff0000"> Basket</font>. So we continue ON, trail turns right, heading West, into the forest we return. Hit a check or two and continue on, not noticing the marks appear to be on the backside of wood and rocks (insert another joke). <br/><br/>At this time we come across the famous<font color="#ff0000"> WIPOS</font> marks. The Post-It, which where not mentioned at the beginning so<font color="#ff0000"> Just Pat</font> was a little confused, but when is he not confused. Once again we all asked What The Fuck are we doing at another <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> hash, he truly is a Worthless Insignificant Piece Of Shit (Worm-Infested Piece of Shit, Worthless Irritating Piece of Shit; you be the judge!). With that said, the trail was the best it was all night and we find the beer stop through the Out Trail. Knowing a <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> trail it is always better going out then in. <br/>Beer was drank, songs where sung,<font color="#ff0000"> Hairy</font> pissed in the circle and the temperature dropped another 10 degrees. We departed the same direction <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> arrived and got lost, then found. <br/><br/>In the circle, chaos commenced. There were two 'new' faces, <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Snotty</font>. Supposedly they ran in circles, but we all know they just did a circle jerk. It was <font color="#ff0000">Baskets</font> b-day so we all gave him the FU and some dirty toys he will play with at a later date. <font color="#ff0000">Oozing </font>was elected HASHIT, but went to <font color="#ff0000">Wee_balls</font> for beer spillage. <br/></body>
