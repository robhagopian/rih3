<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The directions for this run being far more precise
than last weeks run, however I have to say you were 0.5 miles out on one
of your co-ordinates, however this is far better than getting the name
of the place wrong! Unlike some Hashers we could mention whose handle begins
with B. </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#008000">[You limey! We use miles in the
States, not kilometers! -- Async]</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The setting was on the western side of Rhode Island
at Durfee Management Area, in Glocester where we have previously run before
but the territory is so varied it is difficult to recall which way is right.
Attendees included </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom, Beyond
Hope, Shine on Harvard Moon</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> (Boston), </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo
Jovi, Jake, Oozing Syph</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">, yours truly and of
course our hare </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">For once I had a bit of luck and was not tailgating
for a change. By arriving a few minutes late your scribe picked up on the
first falsie and was immediately leading the pack with Shitbag, I mean
of course </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing Syph</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
maybe we could call him </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shitbag Oozing Syph</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">?
As he is always the dickhead wearing it, he almost owns it! Anyway back
to the run </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and I were burning miles leading the way shouting ON-ON, UP DOWN THE ROAD,
that is until we got to a clearing which scattered the pack, with no marks
in site everybody was all over the place even Jake was chasing his own
backside not knowing whether to fart, bark or crap. A cunning check where
the Hare gave no clues, just standing shouting where the f*** are you going,
or did he? As our one and only Bimbo apparently found the trail after some
five minutes, the hare finally gave the call of ON-ON, wherby everyone
cascaded back from two states. I of course had to negotiate my way down
a rock face, I only wish the Hare would be more considerate to leave a
rope so we could absail down these objects of distraction. As usual I again
found myself keeping a rear guard action but finally catching up with our
primo shortcutter professing he had run 15 miles around an imaginary lake-I
believe you </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">!

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We passed a state marker differentiating between
Rhode Island and Connecticut. I felt it was Vermont for the distance we
had covered. &nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#008000">[Snot, would you
like some cheese with your whine? -- Async] </FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;We
eventually came to the beer stop which was at a river crossing which was
actually quite refreshing, mosquitoes were biting like bastards, but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">

breaking her teeth whilst giving a blow job. Jake was by far the brightest
as he decided to have a shit which gave all the mosquitoes a better target.
Good old Jake, never underestimate a former GM. </FONT></P>

straight forward with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">

to the minus 96, with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">

no option than to re-award the Hashshit back to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
which he was most grateful for. The on-on was at Cady’s tavern where the
Barmaid was also the order taker, cook, server and washer upper. The hamburgers
tasted like cardboard and they took over an hour to be burned. This down
graded the run another ten points. No incidents going home except </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">

two. </FONT></P>
