Johnston, Central Ave; 295 Overpass</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT>, our hare, set the start of tonight’s
hash on Central Avenue under the 295 overpass in Johnston.&nbsp; Anyone
with the “Half a Brain” it takes to hash, should have realized you didn’t
have to stray far from the directions down 295.&nbsp; Our honorary bimbo
from Boston, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Shine On</FONT>, carried the letter
of the directions past our start and into Providence’s West End before
realizing she was off track.&nbsp; Shame on <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT>
for not being more specific about the off ramp signs, but then maybe he
wasn’t interested in hearing her wining on trail.&nbsp; After all, we did
have <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT> to fill that gap.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket,
Hopeless</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Jake</FONT> rounded out the
assembled group at the start.&nbsp; Starting 5 minutes late, waiting for
<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Shine On</FONT> who didn’t show until much later,
we started out.

<P>The trail went under 295 and left along a fence that paralled to the
highway through briar and bramble.&nbsp; A couple of checks were just enough
for <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT> to cum up with some lame excuse
about his eye (my ass) and the quickly diminishing hash was now down to
3 and a dog.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozing</FONT> was probably enjoying
the first set with Mick Jagger at Great Woods, and was missing a glorious
trail.&nbsp; To bad the rain stopped, it would have been nice to know he
was sitting on his Pakistani ass in wet grass, and was as uncomfortable
as we were in the quickly dropping temperature.

<P>We finally reached the Power Lines and we ran on actual trails, at least
for the moment.&nbsp; When we got close to Atwood Avenue, the trail went
through bush again, into the K Mart Shopping Center, under 295, behind
Super Stop and Shop and back into the bush.&nbsp; We meandered along until
we reached a School Bus storage area, and eventually made our way to Rte
6A and the Johnston Park.&nbsp; Lots of big haired bimbo’s were jogging
around the pond, and it did seem like an obvious place for a beer stop.&nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT> let <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Beyond Hope</FONT>
and <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT> circumnavigate the pond twice looking
for flour, and smelling the perfumed breeze as we passed the young bimbo’s.&nbsp;
Finally, with his patience running low, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT>
called us back onto trail, which led up 6A back to the power lines.&nbsp;
We eventually made our way to the scenic overlook beer stop, with <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>
and <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Shine</FONT> On sniffing for beer and farts.&nbsp;
The former not found, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT> pulled the beer
out of a sack hidden in plain view.&nbsp; I remember how dangerous it was
letting <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT> get close to the beer stop.&nbsp;
He would drink all, or hide the rest before the pack showed.&nbsp; A little
education sure has made a mark on him.

<P>A few songs and beers later, we were back on trail to the start.&nbsp;
Down down to the hare, the lazy, and the late cumer. Then we were off to
Scotties Pub (now renamed something I forgot) Food and beer were served,
then a huge male bimbo from the bar was infatuated with our <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Shine
On</FONT>, asked to join the table.&nbsp; He remained there even after
being Allowetted, and the fact that he didn’t punch me out for it was good
enough to end the night with our best bimbo.
