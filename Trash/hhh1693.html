Arriving late I discovered some lovely harrietts c*ming out of the woods to the lot. They said something to the effect of 'I don't think we're supposed to be here' and turned back into the woods and I promptly followed. This led to a beautiful Whisky check. Given the beauty of the area I asked where trail started from and cranium'd off in that direction.<br/>
I followed a well marked loop of gentle shiggy back to the W stop where marks became sparse but was able to find hashers drinking beer by the water and some c*ming out of the woods. I was promptly informed that trail acually continued on and thus grabbed a beer and blazed on through thicker shiggy myself to find a CB 8. Returned to the beer and circle washad. 1.56 mi <br/>
