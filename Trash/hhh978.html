<p><font color="#008000">Run #978,</font> Jan 3, 2005.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Async</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Douglas State Forest</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 40’s, Light Rain</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, Just Jeremiah, Dr WHO, Dry Foot Fairy, 
Fuwangi Boner, Tinker, WIPOS, Seamus, Ben.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Visitor/Virgin:</font>&nbsp; Just Ariana.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>It was unseasonably warm, if not toasty. A light rain was falling. It was pitch black. What better way to greet 
the New Year than to show up in the middle-of-nowhere Massachusetts for a run set by an unemployed hare recovering 
from multiple surgeries.&nbsp; The usuals showed up, mostly late after getting lost. A virgin showed up. After 
seeing <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, she soon wished she hadn’t. But 
she was stuck, momentarily unable to come up with plausible excuses. At any rate, the run started unusually late and 
they left the start at the side of East Thompson Road opposite High Street at about 6:50. [Instructions included a 
plea from the hare to keep an eye out for his cell-phone, lost on trail earlier in the day. Right! These wankers can’t 
find a jumbo cooler full of beer when it’s marked with a giant “B”. Find a 3” x 2” cell phone in a bunch of leaves 
somewhere in one of three states? I don’t think so. But I digress.]</p>

<p>Trail led east into the woods on a path leading to the Southern New England Trunkline Trail. The group was together 
as they crossed the Rocky Brook on a bridge and came to the trunkline. No one was fooled by the check, and they 
continued straight slightly south of east, and began to climb. The virgin <font color="#FF0000">Just Ariana</font> 
voiced some concerns about getting left behind in the woods, particularly after watching the athletic grace of 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>. But she was reassured as she watched <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> stumbling through the night. She stayed safe in the middle of the pack. She was 
the only one actually looking for a phone.</p>

<p>Soon a dip in the trail led to some flooded paths and another river crossing. A check soon after the river led 
south on the Mid-State Trail. Although some tried to circumvent it, the paths were progressively more flooded. This 
was some fine shiggy, and it was ultimately more trouble avoiding the water than just skipping through it. Feet were 
satisfactorily moistened. No cell-phone could have withstood this part of the trail. The group was somewhat spread out 
at this point, but a bushwhacking loop off and back to the trail followed by the hare caught the front runners (led 
by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>) but good, and they were back together soon.</p>

<p>Continuing south, they came to a check that was near the terminus of the North-South Trail. True trail led southwest 
to the Mass-RI border where a check was found surrounding the marker. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>charged 
ahead using random guesses to find trail.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
having been lost in this area on multiple previous hashes, followed and correctly guessed the location of the beer. 
Thus they easily found the trail heading west and uphill to the Tri-State Marker and the beer check. Very soon, they 
all arrived. The cellular reception was excellent from this high point. But <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>had 
found the beer, and was trying to make away with it. He had to be forcibly dragged back by the hare.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Just Ariana</font> was favorably impressed with the choice of Guinness for the BC. [As were 
the rest, expecting a more typical <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>-Recycled-Office-Beer-Choice. Unemployment seems 
to suit him. Or maybe he couldn’t call for the cheap stuff, being without a phone. But I digress.] The rhubarb as so 
often is the case lately, refused to rise, and another dreary and prolonged songfest interfered with the enjoyment of 
the beverages. At least <font color="#FF0000">Just Jeremiah</font> had a new song for the group. In the woods, 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>must have heard this caterwauling, so he never appeared. [Or he could have been 
making free calls to Bangkok on the hare’s cell-phone.] This caused some concern to <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Ariana</font> (and the hare, who would have to go out and retrieve him if he did not eventually appear.)&nbsp; No one 
else seemed to care. But before they left, a token beer was left precariously balanced on the tip of the Tri-State 
Marker, for <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>or as an offering to the Hash gods.</p>

<p>Trail out followed the CT-MA border northwards, bushwhacking along the sides of the slope. They moved along 
slowly through the brush and came back out on the Trunkline trail, where they encountered a strange form, bulky and 
dark, with a long pink stick. It was <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. He did not have a phone. But he did have 
cab-fare. Spirits fell yet again, but they continued northeast on the trunkline, and back to the check where the 
hare instructed them to circle up on the bridge. The beer was easily found and they settled down, waiting for 
stragglers. The circle was called to order as it was getting cold. And just as the ratings were begun, 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> showed up. Another run ruined by perfect attendance at the circle!</p>

<p>The ratings were fair, as always: good weather, no pavement, virgin present, loss of two (including <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>) at the BC were balanced by recycled trail, recycled BC, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> AND <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> at the BC, and the sight of <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
in shorts. Total: +0.69 Next, the virgin was brought into the circle. She didn’t know her own name, claimed that 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> made her come, and said her favorite sexual position was doggy-style. She then sang 
a song which was amusing if not obscene. We don’t get virgins like this very often anymore. Why is that? Now the time 
had come (yet again) to try to name <font color="#FF0000">Just Jeremiah</font>. The naming skills of the RIH3, never 
all that great to begin with, have been strained in recent weeks. But as the son of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo 
Jovi,</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Big Sh*t,</font> the best they could come up with was <font 
color="#FF0000">Steaming Pile of Turds</font> (SPOT). Time will tell if this will stick. For once, at least, no one 
tried to rename <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. 
The reasoning was too convoluted to even try to recall.</p>

<p>Religion was finally performed, and they agreed to head for George’s Pizza in Pascoag. <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Ariana</font> had had some time to think. She quickly remarked that she had to pick someone up at the airport at 10PM, 
so she couldn’t make it. She assured all she would be back soon. Muttering something about changing email accounts, 
she drove off. The rest convoyed to George’s, where pizza was ordered, and bets were made on whether the new hasher 
would ever return. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and<font color="#FF0000"> Fuwangi </font>were believers, and 
took on all bets. They were given four weeks for her reappearance, after which money would change hands. Watch future 
hash trash for the exciting conclusion!</p>

<p>[Addendum: The hare reports that he and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went out on Tuesday to the same area, 
and were able to recover the phone, still functioning. Perhaps we should all give unemployment a chance.]</p>
