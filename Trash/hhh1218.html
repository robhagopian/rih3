color=#000000>OK. So it was a kayak/canoe hash. How much can there be to say 
about that? The start was from a boat launch just above a dam in Hope Village, 
at the border of Cranston and Scituate, on the Pawtuxet river. Pubic, WHO, Bondo 
and the hare were in Kayaks. WIPOS and Wee Balls shared a canoe, as did Basket, 
Tinker and Short Shorts. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

color=#000000>“Trail” was marked with economy. There may actually have been many 
marks, but the river was moving, and they probably had long since washed over 
the dam. The flotilla headed upstream, northwest. There were maybe two checks, 
with falsies leading to blind ends. WHO was stupid enough to try both falsies. 
This was the only thing which made the event resemble a hash. Oh, AND the fact 
that WIPOS and Wee Balls led, and managed to miss the beer check, continuing 
upstream to the dam at Scituate Ave.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

canoers returned, and managed to tip over trying to get out of their canoe. Ha, 
Ha! None of the kayakers tipped. And WIPOS wanted WHO to join him for the Mews 
Canoe race. Good Luck!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finally, they grew low on beer, and bored with song. They headed 
back. Downstream. Southeast. Exciting? It was growing dark as they pulled in. 
After loading the boats on their cars, they circled up overlooking the dam. 
Ratings: No shiggy (except for WIPOS, Ha, Ha!), few marks and no one lost 
balanced against 22.69% bimbos, and complete lack of pavement. Total: +0.69. 
Hashit went to Wee Balls initially for choosing to ride with WIPOS. However, as 
is often the case, it wound up (appropriately) with 
Basket.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
