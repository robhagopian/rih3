</font><font face="Arial" size="2">It was to have been a wondrous event, but 
sadly it ended with sadness and despair. The voting will be called to question 
for all time. The excitement lost forever, and yet few relish in this thwarted 
justice. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The air was cold, even if the 
hearts pounding loudly blocking the roar of the crowd, moved each to his own 
level of enthusiasm. It had been a long time, and everyone was filled with 
anticipation. Who would have thought it would vanish in a blush.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Canadians would find 
happiness, and the remainder wondered…. WHY?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I am speaking of the Olympics 
of course, and how the Americans would be robbed by the Canadians of their gold. 
The Americans finished their programs, without flaw, and the crowd loved even 
reveled in its perfection. The Canadians had 2, some say 3 faults, and one a 
major that should have cast them to bronze at best. Even so, as the scores for 
the Americans were recorded: 5.8, 5.7, 5.8, 5.8, 5.8, 5.8, 5.8, for 
presentation, followed by even lower scores for the technical, it became 
apparent they were fucked.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as the hash was at the AGM. 
The hounds took the trail, after listening to the hare, <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo,</font> explain the marks would be found on the sides of the telephone 
poles. We left the warmth of the garage, neatly arraigned with chairs, tables, 
food, beer, and voting paraphernalia, into the cold New England air. 
Temperatures were dropping into the teens and the wind chill would pull many a 
penis into micrometer measurements. Do we hear “Major Shrinkage” here?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">But first let me paint a 
picture here. This was the AGM and the first in at least 3 years. A major event, 
at the very least. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> has been a proponent for 
another, and even though advice was to hold it on a weekend and invite visitors 
to make a grand spectacle of it fell on deef ears, we bowed to his hineyness. 
Foolishly thinking he would go beyond what is expected of a mortal, and bestows 
on us the Bodhisattva Hash.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">This was supposed to be a 
formal event. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> had black tie and jacket,
<font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font> was dressed in her best sultry black 
strapless, boob thrusting, sheer to the waist Victoria Secret’s finest,
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Wipos</font> had 
exchanged their thermal underwear, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>
cleaned his best, and only, lab coat. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">As we ran along Meadow, 
following the hare’s direction, to the right from the driveway, not one mark was 
found. When we encountered the intersection, <font color="#FF0000">Dr.WHO</font> 
went right, and the balance of the pack traveled left on both sides of the 
street. Still no marks! <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, questioning 
sensibility, returned to see if the trail had actually gone right out of the 
drive, and encountered Bondo, who explained the trail was left and the marks 
were on the side of the Telephone Pole. Re-checking the pole, none were found. 
So I as when these marks would have been set? Oh, yesterday afternoon! “Before 
the downpour last night and 50 mph winds”, I inquired? “Oh, it rained that hard 
last night?”, responded <font color="#FF0000">Bondo.</font> Any fool would have 
stepped out and set live trail, but <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, our 
French Canadian (remember?), decided it was best to keep warm in the garage next 
to the fire and beer.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Eventually all found their way 
in, and the voting for live trail was thus:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> 
5.8 for endurance and going right around the block, </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS
</font>5.7 for sticking the trail to the left, but finding marks right again 
where there was no trail, took points away.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Ever 
Ready</font> 5.8 for have a Bimbo on trail, and the best cleavage.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>5.1 for turning back so quickly and settling on amber (beer).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
5.9 for staying home, and being Mr. MoM. (WOW)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>6.0 a perfect trail. Leading himself down Winter Street to Cold Spring 
Park, following marks from a month ago, and still making his way back to the 
beer and food.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Congratulations
<font color="#FF0000">OOZING</font>!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">And <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>~ let’s just say we renamed him the New Moon.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">As any Old Fart RIH3’r would 
remember, <font color="#FF0000">Moon</font> was notorious at setting shitty 
trail. His last, from his porch, resulted in him being banned from setting 
trail, and allowing him to enjoy his Carling Black Label all by himself. Enough 
of the trail, the AGM could pull the whole thing off, right? WRONG!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Bondo decided, in his 
omnipotent wisdom, to judge the awards himself. Best Trail –
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, Best On On – <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
yadda, yadda. He did give <font color="#FF0000">Misses Enema Bill </font>the 
worst hash, but in retrospect, we may have to rethink that.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The only Gold to come of this 
event…..<font color="#FF0000">ASYNC</font> for Grand Master!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now what can we do for encores?
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">PS, he also got Web Masterbater, 
Trail Master, and Hash Cash. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">PPS, he owes us $25.00 to cover 
the food for the event.</font></p>
