<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare: </font>Oozing SD (substituting)<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Touisset Marsh Wildlife Preserve, Warren<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather: </font>mid 30's, Clear<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present: </font><font color="#FF0000">The Slasher Dr WHO, Fuwangi Boner, WIPOS, Basket Boom Boom, 
KNO,</font> (and at on On On <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>), and Visitor: <font color="#FF0000">Comes On 
Vacation </font>(COV - Happy Valley)<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></font></p>

<p><br>The run was a clockwise loop, possibly the shortest non-<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> run in history. After a 
quick distribution of mardi-gras beads for the occasion, the hare ran off to live-set trail. The later arrivals gave the 
hare about ten minutes, and then they began, entering the refuge south along the edge of the first of many open: fields. 
A check had<font color="#FF0000"> Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> back on Touisset road, but true trail 
continued south to the next: field. Some woods provided a little confusion for FRB <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. 
But the trail soon led to: a field.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> regained the lead, turning west crossing a shallow 
bog, crossing a small: field and coming out onto the shoreline of the Kickemuit River.<br><br>

Around the bend (like the hare) they went turning north and re-entering: another field. Trail led north up the: field, 
where they crossed through some bushes to encounter: a field. Finally, they turned west into the woods. A check sent 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Baske</font>t back to the cars over some frozen mud and ice, 
but <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> turned south where he came upon the hare, the Beer check, and: a field. They 
finally gathered for beer. <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> made excuses for <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> who 
was sick. The hare made excuses for <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> who was sick. COV the visitor made excuses for 
coming, not on vacation but to kill Rhode Island chickens, who were sick. Coincidence?<br><br>

The run back to the start was notable only because it lacked: a field. They circled in the woods near the cars and rated 
the run: a short run, clear weather, minimal shiggy, the hare snared by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>! But the hare 
had volunteered to take an empty slot, and a merciful score was given: 6.9 minus a 1 point deduction for every: field. 
Total: -6.9. Hashit would have gone to <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>, but we are running out of toilet seats, and 
since <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> chose not to attend, he was given the prize. Convenient, too, as he already had 
it. The visitor was not renamed Red C*ck-Killer.<br><br>

On On On was at The Tinker's Nest in Warren where there was some bizarre card tournament in progress. <font 
color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> joined the group, not looking very sick at all, although slightly flushed and tousled 
with a faraway smile that gave<font color="#FF0000"> KNO </font>some pause. That's what you get when you run on Monday 
nights and leave a spouse at home alone;<font color="#FF0000"> KNO</font> just hasn't learned that yet like the rest of 
us have. But good beer was had, and good food (although good-bye to the $1 cheeseburgers on Monday nights, apparently) 
was eaten. Another quiet and genteel ending to a hash. What are we coming to?</p>
