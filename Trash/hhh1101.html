<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">The “monday monDAY MONDAY” Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1101</font>, May 7, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Cocumcussoc State Park, Wickford, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 60s, sunny</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket, Dr. WHO, Oozing, Just John, Amish Ithead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>I can summarize this hash easily - left, briar, briar, water, left, briar, left, briar, check, briar, water, water, 
briar, left, briar.  That’s it.</p>

<p>What came to mind after the run was how similar this was to a NASCAR race, lots of lefts and the hash traveling in a 
pack.  The big difference was that unlike a NASCAR race there was no beer, no bimbos, no fast cars and most importantly no 
beer.  Oh, and there were briars.  NASCAR doesn’t have briars.  I’m going to assign NASCAR driver names to each hasher for 
this writeup based on appearance and personality:</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> – <b>Mark Martin</b>.  I don’t know, he looks pretty old.  Sorry I couldn’t be more 
creative <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> – <b>Ricky Rudd</b>.  Again, lack of creativity, but NASCAR and good ‘ol southern boy 
names like “Ricky” go together like some Southern Comfort and your sister.  I could picture <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> as a “Ricky.”<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> – <b>Dick Trickle</b>.  Although retired, every NASCAR event needs a little Dick.  
Just like <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Just John</font> – <b>Jeff Gordon</b>.  You know, pretty boy that you can almost picture batting for 
the other team.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> – <b>Dale Jr</b>.  Son of one of the greatest drivers of all time (peace be with you 
Sr, racin’ in heaven with the angels, praise the Lord)<br>
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> – <b>Pace Car</b>.  We’ll leave it at that, although the pace car always knows where 
to go, unlike <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.</p>

<p>The race started on monday, monDAY, MONDAY at the east entrance of Cocumcussoc State Park of Post Rd.  Parked at the 
picnic area, <font color="#FF0000">Dick Trickle</font> performed a gentlemanly act, opening his rear for the others and 
offered up some beer.  Complaints arose because it was only warm Sam Adams but it ends up those would be the best beers 
the pack would have over the next 2hrs.</p>

<p>With marks pointing west, the pace car set out into the park at 6:30 with <font color="#FF0000">Mark Martin</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Ricky</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Jeff</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dale</font> in close 
pursuit.  <font color="#FF0000">Gordon</font> blasted off to the front of the pack showing off those rainbow warrior 
colors.  A little briars here, a lot of briars there and eventually the pack ended up on a nice trail.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Ricky</font> then took the lead with the others drafting close behind.  At a stone wall/check <font 
color="#FF0000">Mark Martin</font> continued straight while <font color="#FF0000">Dale Jr.</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Jeff</font> headed off to the right.  Just to prevent questioning about this partnering action, <font 
color="#FF0000">Jr.</font> is straight as an arrow – his Wrangler jean commercials prove that.  Leading the pack like his 
father (may he rest in peace), <font color="#FF0000">Jr.</font> crossed the first stream of the day.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Mark Martin</font> continued far off into the distance, <font color="#FF0000">Ricky</font> followed close 
behind <font color="#FF0000">Jr.</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Jeff</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dick</font> were 
positioned in the rear.</p>

<p>Eventually the pack went farther west and recrossed the stream back to the south side into the briars.  A left (away 
from the wall – like where Dale Sr. should have gone to prevent that horrible accident that caused even Jesus to cry) had 
<font color="#FF0000">Ricky</font> up front and the rest of the pack following close behind.  Left, left, left, briar, 
briar, briar.  Eventually a check was encountered and <font color="#FF0000">Ricky</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Mark</font>
, <font color="#FF0000">Jeff</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Jr.</font> continued straight.  <font color="#FF0000">Dick
</font> must have been running on 7 cylinders because he was far behind, pretty much hanging with the pace car.  After 
traveling around the banked corner and onto the rear stretch the pack realized there were no more marks.  Coming back to 
the check the pace car directed them left, inwards, towards the water, briars and away from everything holy (like the 
checkered flag).  After traveling through that crap for a good bit it was realized that this, too, wasn’t the way to go 
and everyone turned around and made there way back to the check.  Realizing straight was a bust, left was a bust and a 
u-turn brought us to pit lane (aka the cars – which would have been the BEST route to take) everyone realized that right 
was the way to go.  Remember, rights in NASCAR are baaaaad.  The wall is there, and the wall is no good.  Just like this 
trail.</p>

<p>This took us into the woods and eventually back onto the trail we would have hit if we continued far enough straight 
and a loop-de-loop around some houses had us back into the swamp.  And briars.  And no fun.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> knows where we were going?  But <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> didn’t, neither did <font color="#FF0000">Mark
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Jeff</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dick</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Jr.</font>  Or the 
pace car.  What we did know was that this trail contained enough briars for 2yrs of Rhode Island hashing. Enough to rip 
half of Seamus’ hair out of his lower body.  Poor, poor Seamus.</p>

<p>After what seamed like 300 laps and 20 pit stops the pack finally ended up behind some houses on Juniper Dr.  A quick 
left onto that road with <font color="#FF0000">Mark Martin</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Jr.</font> leading the pack 
had us turn left onto Post Rd and back to the cars.  <font color="#FF0000">Ricky</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Gordon
</font> and the pace car arrived at about the same time with <font color="#FF0000">Dick Trickle</font>, as usual, rounding 
up the rear.  The pace car was sent out to retrieve the beer stop beer and eventually <font color="#FF0000">Dick</font> 
showed up.  Booo.</p>

<p>With the pace car cruising back with the beer and the pack hanging around the cars with wounds weeping blood we circled 
in the dark – a full 2+ hrs after the start of this pathetic race. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> stated this was the 
worst run his entire hash career, <font color="#FF0000">John</font> stated that if this was his first hash it’d be his 
last, others stated that there was no trail – therefore no hash, and that this should be an example of how NOT to set 
trail.  Rating was <b>–6.9</b> and the hashit ended up going to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for being so 
charitable with his warm Sam Adams prior to the run and for passing out at midnight at his own Cinco de Mayo party.  
Pathetic!</p>

<p>After tending to their wounds the pack headed off the Gillians, home of the famous basket I Pee A.  Upon arrival <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> found how his daughter had been bucked (“b”ucked guys) from a horse and had to go home to tend 
to her injury.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was given a high-chair for his dining pleasure and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> decided that the fish Rueben was the way to go.  WTF?  After a night like this there wasn’t 
enough IPA in the keg to make the mental and physical pain go away.  Shame on you <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, 
shame on you!</p>
