<p>What could be better than a winter rainfall for a Monday night hash? And in virgin territory, on “the island”! 
Obviously few shared the hare’s views on this matter, as no one but the dregs bothered to show, for what legitimately 
could be considered Trail-of-the-year! But 6:30 always comes around, and led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> followed trail south from the parking area 
opposite the Polo Fields at Glen Farm.</p>

<p>Trail led around the schooling ring and turned left towards the Polo Fields. The trail led for a few hundred yards 
through a fine combination of thistles, mud and old horse manure. It came to a check that obviously turned right into the 
woods. There were few choice here. The “trail” was densely hemmed in with briars, and the way was 80% under water from the 
recent rains. Led by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, the group embarked upon a counter-clockwise circle through the 
muck, ending up on an eastward trail to a legitimate swamp and a check.</p>

<p>As they cast about trying to find true trail, they could hear a horn in the distance. This meant one of three 
possibilities: <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> or an eccentric fox-hunter giving 
chase through the dark in a swamp. They quickened their pace. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tried left, further into 
the swamp. <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> tied a drier path more sharply left, out of the Swamp. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> tried right, and almost gave up, until he saw the hare following. Trail led out to Sandy 
Point Ave.</p>

<p>Another check led to some confusion, but meanwhile the distant bugle appeared to be approaching. The pace became 
frantic. Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> found a mark heading east, and correctly took Colonel Barton Dr 
to Colonel Christopher Green Rd. They were confused for a moment by the absence of the hare, but at Sigourney Rd, he 
called them back and they continued east to Sandy Point Beach. Trail now led north on the beach to a check just across a 
stream. Each hasher made a decision, and all of them were wrong; most satisfying for the hare.</p>

<p>Finally, trail was found by Short Peck, turning west on a wooded path parallel to the stream. A few more checks were 
dealt with and the group came to a ruined stone cottage in the middle of the stream. Trail led into the cottage. Trail led 
out of the cottage. But the hashers, sensing a good spot for a BC, stayed put and waited for the hare. They waited. And 
waited. To the north, they could hear the whistles of the hare. To the south, faintly, they could hear a bugle. They 
finally abandoned their post and turned north and uphill to come out at a field and the hare’s light.</p>

<p>The hare informed them that he had hidden the beer under one of the three giant fir trees. Unfortunately, it soon 
became apparent that there were in fact FIVE giant fir trees. After some profanity and rolling about under dense evergreen 
foliage in the mud, <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> came up with the juice, and they moved into an old open horse 
stall in the middle of the field. A few songs were started. The bugle in the distance became fainter so they all breathed 
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Trail back was begun, but after a brief shiggy patch crossing a stream, the hare decided to save the rest of the trail 
for the next time, and led the group on a visit to his daughter’s horse, in the hope that one of the hashers would get 
kicked in the head. No such luck, and they came back west on the stable roads. They circled.</p>

<p>Ratings were of course reflective of the outstanding shiggy, the virgin territory, the lack of <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> and/or <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> the mysterious bugler with the only subtractions being the hare 
losing his own beer, and the lack of bimbos: <b>+0.69</b>. Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Why? Because I say 
so, that’s why! On On On was at the Coddington Brew Pub, where the small numbers didn’t prevent the waitresses from 
giving the group a jaundiced eye and an isolated table as they sat subdued and repentant from their last visit to this 
establishment.</p>
