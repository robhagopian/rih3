<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">Apologies to the Hash for my disregard

so much effort on his part deserved so much more of mine. <br>

The Hare called all to the Burrillville High School with promises of 'Sights yet 
unseen' 'nor tread upon by the Hash'. <font color="#FF0000">The Slasher</font> 
waited patiently along with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> for the hare to 
arrive. It was the Hare's birthday, 54 years young, and the
<font color="#FF0000">Everyready Eager Beaver</font> had arrived just to insure 
her birthday gift to the hare would make the festivities. She gave all a quick 
kiss and asked <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi </font>to do the same to the 
hare when he arrives. Off she went to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> 
house to drop off the gift, for one so deserving, then on to her house to tend 
to her little children, alone and cold in her house. She had forgotten to pay 
the utilities and the evil Gas Company had severed her service, surely they 
would survive the 50 minutes it would take for her to return and turn the 
propane grill on to warm their tiny bodies. &nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">The temperature was dropping quickly, 
and she knew they would survive, plus her car's heater kept things just ducky 
for her on the ride up and back home. Good Luck Kids, and remember it's just 2 
weeks to Christmas and Santa's making a list, so don't bitch. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica"><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
joined the fray, and all were beginning to get itchy feet, as
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> drove up. His directions were clear and 
concise: red flour on white snow, A to B, short but interesting virgin trail, 
great beer stop and OnOn, with the OnOnOn party to be the years &quot;Great Event&quot;.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">The pack started out behind the tennis 
courts and soon got, lost with the mixture of dog/foot/deer prints mottling up 
the refrozen snow. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was off trail, but 
amazingly found flour heading across a field. The pack followed quickly, and was 
soon going east then west along the Soccer (Football) field fence.
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> spotted flour and called the pack around the 
Hockey Arena and into a series of paths. No other than the hash had been here 
since the snow, so following the hare's footprints was like licking the panties 
off of the <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font>, &quot;Easy Street&quot;! </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">A check at the Branch River stalled the 
pack for a short time until WIPOS, with his night vision goggles, spotted 
footprints still warm from the afternoons setting, let the pack through a Nipmuc 
Village set along the river. 9 Huts of various designs were found, with one 
great long one in the center. The trail led out through a gate of tied branches 
and southward downstream. A check was encountered and I attempted to wade out to 
see if there were markings on the opposite side of a Great Falls. Just as I 
stepped into the frigid water, <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>called, &quot;On On 
On&quot;, as he ran inside a dried up river tributary. This reminded me much of my 
Pakistani home, with little water, just dried up shit, rocks, and muck. Why any 
honest Indian would want to control my homeland is beyond me. They can just take 
it and shove it up there tight brown arses, as far as I'm concerned, give me New 
York, bright lights, beer and loose women, screw the veils and Taliban. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">The pack made their way behind private 
property marked with the hideous Christmas light burning bright their electric 
bill, and a massive cross ablaze like none in Klu Klux Klan county 'Bama' during 
the 60's. It was at least 40 feet tall, all ablaze with white lights saying to 
all &quot; we're white, and we're right, what are you?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">We found tarmac and followed the trail 
to the town salt mines and sandpits. A check here brought all to a halt as the 
confused pack (easily done), finally found marks down to the river and into a 
marsh. This Back River area was covered with bronze covered muck at least a foot 
thick, and as we traversed out to the road again, we found ourselves knee deep 
in primordial ooze. Climbing up the opposite bank, we found marks traveling East 
to Rte 102 and then South to the entrance of the Burrillville Water Purification 
Plant. Mohammed I wish we had these back home, so I wouldn't have had to travel 
so far just to get sweet tasting water. You American assholes don't know what a 
great benefit have good bacteria can be to bad shit. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">The trail led out past the Animal 
Rescue, Water Works, and eventually along a power line to the now closed 
Burrillville Dump. &nbsp;A check had the pack spilt in all directions, but
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>call 
all along a path. They were on the wrong side of the fence however and lagged 
far behind the pack as they found trail and the Beer Near mark leading up to the 
top of the old dump. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica"><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Baxter</font> were waiting for us at the top, and being 
the first to arrive, I swallowed deeply from the keg the hare carried to the 
highest point in NorthWest Glendale. As the remainder of the pack made their way 
up the snow covered mountain, I was aghast at the wondrous view. It was a 
cloudless night, with just enough moons to light the snow in 360 degrees. You 
could almost see Boston, not that anyone in his or her right mind would want to, 
but it was almost possible. Trinity Brown Ale was served and many hash songs 
were song in the still night air. Temperature was around 12 F, but the warmth 
felt by all was more than enough to bring a smile to frozen faces. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">Beer finished; we made our way back 
down the hill, where the trail crossed the Branch River. <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> complained like a girlie, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was 
protected by his specially made &quot;all weather gear&quot;, <font color="#FF0000">Async,</font> 
the good Doctor, the dogs, and I found the temperature of the water to be about 
15 degrees warmer than the air and relished in its comfort. As we continued on 
the opposite bank, we found flour leading into the Long House and the pack 
opened beer and waited to celebrate the hare's arrival. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">Lobster was served, and Trinity Brew 
was enjoyed as we sang &quot;The Monks of St. Bernard&quot; to call all to the circle. The 
hare receive his down downs, one for hare, one for birthday, and one for 
carrying the Hashit left behind by myself on the previous hash. Admitting to 
stupidity, I suggested many to carry this torch, but all were denied by this 
most Democratic Group. I, again, received the Hashit, for what I know not, but 
since they are all learned and white, except for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
who's French Canadian, they must know better than I. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">After Down Downs and songs and a grand 
Swing Low, we made our way to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>. Turkey 
dinner with all the fixin's, along with late cumer <font color="#FF0000">Tinker 
Bell </font>and a roaring fire made for a delicious end of a grand evening. <br>
