style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Starting 
from the Buckeye Brook Rd parking area, the pack arrived to find the hare 
missing. To pass the time and find a spot to take a leak, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> crossed the road 
south and found some marks. But the hare soon arrived and directed them north. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> would be stupid enough to listen to the hare. So, 
when 6:30 rolled around, the entire pack headed north; <FONT

was on paths with a few checks to the left, but true trail almost always to the 
right. The hare avoided some fine spots. The canoe launch on the Pawcatuck. The 
summit of Shumankanuk Hill. The fine trail along the railroad. To mention a few; 
perhaps inspiring a future hare in this area. Regardless, the pack mastered the 
first few checks with little effort. But as they turned east, then south, 
confusion became king. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

North Camp area, and began to bushwhack. Trail turned west again. Finally, trail 
was found heading south. Of course! The beer check would be on the shores of the 
Watchaug Pond. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT>, at least 
should have realized this. Especially <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, who had

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">After 
a few attempts to mislead, the trail led to the shores of the Watchaug Pond. 
Marks were few, and there was much milling about.The hare showed up, but as 
usual, was no help. The beach with the obvious spot for a beer check was empty. 
They turned west along the shores. No marks. East led to falsies. Finally the 
hare relented and placed a few new marks to lead them to the beer. After an 
extensive search near the almost invisible “B”, it was finally 
found.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

a chitty trail, what could be better than a chitty beer. Perhaps a chitty-chitty 
bang-bang. But there were no bimbos. A few songs were sung, the beer was 
consumed, and, as twighlight approached, they headed back. Trail was poorly 
marked. This was an improvement upon the first half. North they went and made it 
back to the parking area with no losses. Even <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> 
found his way back.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
