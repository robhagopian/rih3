<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>This is a summary. This is only a summary. There are no frills, when we’re this far behind on the trash. Feel free to 
send your comments to DrWHO@icouldgiveashit.com.</p>

<p>The trail started from Everett Skinner Road, in Wrentham, at some ball-fields just south of Wrentham State Forest. The 
small group was stag yet again, with a visitor from Chang Mai Underground Men’s Hash. More manliness. Great. Trail went 
straight into the woods, northeast.</p>

<p>There was some light bushwhacking. There was an easy and dry stream crossing. They ended up at a fence guarding a tree 
farm. They crossed the fence, all except <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> who marched as usual to the beat of his own 
drummer. He was not seen again. The hare lost his own trail at this point.  Finally, a few marks were found turning 
northwest, and coming out at the intersection of Everett Skinner and Cowell Street. They crossed.</p>

<p>Trail immediately went back into some light bushwhacking in the woods west of Everett Skinner. They continued west to 
some powerlines. They turned southeast. There were at first a few marks on the powerline poles. Then a mark was seen on a 
frozen puddle. But then there were no marks at all. The hare indicated that they should continue. They crossed School 
Street. Finally, they came upon a beer check. It was unmarked. But the hare hung back and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
took the hint and found the satchel. They tried to get <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to continue on. It might have 
worked but for the fact that they had to hold the visitor at the beer. Even <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> catches on 
eventually.</p>

<p>There was some light singing at the BC, but no one wanted to attract <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. It became 
clear that he was lost for good. Everyone began to enjoy themselves. Once a sizeable dent had been made in the beer, they 
gathered up and ran back to the cars, northeast on School street, and left to the fields. Still no <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>. There was great rejoicing. But like a turd on the bottom freed by an errant swirl in the septic system, 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> finally resurfaced, with his usual tales of brilliant trail, missed shiggy, etc. They 
circled.</p>

<p>Ratings for the run favored the virgin territory, the loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and charitably 
overlooked the lack of real shiggy. Total: <b>+0.69</b>. Hashit made the usual rounds: from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, but of course settled upon the most deserving: <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>. The On On On was at L. A. Roberts. There was singing. There was a retired hasher from Tampa who bought the table 
a round. There was an acquaintance of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font>, a young lady (undoubtedly a dangerous 
psychopath given her evident affection for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>) who stopped by. And that’s all I care to 
say about this one.</p>
