The Tird tried his best to keep the regulars away. With OOzing, Hairy, LB, Amish and Meat Wallet cooling their beer in Iceland, there were others that had no excuse other than the veiled threats from our Hare about the dangers we'd find on trail. The small parking lot had a few cars there already, as I pulled in following Butt Plug. SSS greeted me with a hug. It's been a long time since her last Hash; she's been in South America forever. The Hare gave a confusing Chalk Talk and explained some additional marks, including one that the Beer/Whiskey checks may not be found near the beverages. Luckily, there were plenty of marks out there for all to follow. <br/><br/>
The Trail started behind the CVS on Rte 136 in Bristol, with a short bushwhack to the neighborhood on Jenny Lane towards Coelho Park. The Hare giggled as we wondered in circles looking for a trail out of the thickets that surrounded the park, when Butt Plug and Just the Tip found flour through the briars. Rusty was caught pecking at the ground like a chicken and had to retrace his chicken tracks back to where the FRBs and the rest of the pack had followed the flour. Trail led over an old roadway and up onto a raised area, heading towards Haffenreffer Museum. I stayed on the hard top and found a check leading into the woods. The pack followed and we were soon at the Whiskey Stop. A number of songs sung and Burbon was enjoyed. WIPOS was creeping around with his phone taking pics and making the virgins a bit nervous. This was not the last time WIPOS and his phone would cause some excitement tonight.  <br/><br/>
Back on trail, we continued bushwhacking easterly towards the bay in Virgin Territory. After a mile or so, the Beer Stop was located. Again, we found ourselves singing, drinking and WIPOS taking photos of the pack doing what the pack does. Then it was on the BS#2 (or tree if you include the WS). It was on the bay, at Mount Hope Point. The view across the water was brilliantly lit with the lights of Fall River and the Bridge. It was the Tird's second trail that had us under that bridge and we talked about the jumper that night. He was lucky (or unlucky depending upon your point of view) that he didn't do the Tird's Hash that night...but I degress. The Tird challenged me to join him for a naked dip in the water, and having just had my hair done, I declined. He was joined by Just Pat, Just the Tip and virgin Just Ashlee. Unfortunately, I missed her entrance and exit, but WHO filled me in on all the glorious details. WIPOS was still stalking the pack taking pics and, again feeling uneasy, the ladies led the way out, going around the fence and back on trail.<br/><br/>
Flour led us onto proper paved roads to an overlook that seemed very familiar. It wasn't until the next day when I went back looking for (spoiler alert) WIPOS' phone, that I realized it was the location for Swamp Whine and Fuwangii's wedding. The trail went right past some private property signs and we made our way back to the cars. Just as we were circling up, WIPOS said he was going back to look for his phone. He had it at the last beer stop, so we weren't about to wait for him. <br/><br/>
The Hare received his just rewards for a shitty (and long) trail and started Beastialities Best that I tried my best to move on to another ditty. Backslider had to explain their absence and getting one married without our consent. Virgins were displayed properly and had their DD and had a song ready for the pack. Hashit was discussed briefly, and it was a shoe win that WIPOS would be the winner for his slinking around the pack and losing his phone. Unfortunately, as it usually happens, the pack chose a lesser candidate and awarded the Hashit to me. Circle ended, we made our way torwards our cars, but not before being stopped by the local constables. Two cars stopped to ask what all the noise was about. Neighbors had complained about mischief going on in the woods. We explained the Hash, as delicately as we could, and they left us in piece. It's a good thing they didn't arrive 2 seconds earlier as they would have caught Just the Tip carrying one of the virgins across the parking lot, feet in the air and giggling all the way.<br/><br/>
The next day I travelled to Mount Hope Farm to look for WIPOS' phone. As I was leaving the last Beer Stop through the woods, I received a call that the Tird found it. In the end, it should have been the Hare with a toilet seat around his neck; maybe next time. <br/>
PS Has anyone seen any of WIPOS' photos?
