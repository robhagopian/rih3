<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Halloween Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1022</font>, October 31, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing Syphilitic Dicktaphone (Pregnant Nun)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; East Side of Providence</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 50’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom (Incontinent Infant-in-Red), Bondo Jovi (The Tin (NOT 
Thin) Man), SESYB (Tattooed Lady), Dr WHO (Scottish Pirate), Dick Doc (Gypsy-Scottish Pirate Wench), Dry Foot Fairy 
(Scottish Pirate Polecat), Great at Giving Head (One-half of the Ambiguously Gay Duo) (The not-so-ambiguous half), Just 
Sandra (Low-budget depiction of Broadway’s “Cats”. Or perhaps an Avant-guarde Scottish Pirate?). <font 
color="#0000FF">Virgin:</font> Just Jennie (Convincingly dressed as someone-who-should-know-better-than-to-follow-Bondo). 
<font color="#0000FF">Hounds:</font> Seamus, Ben. <font color="#0000FF">Late-cummers:</font> Mother Goose (Miss Conception 
2005), Bungy (Super(Cleavage)Girl). <font color="#0000FF">Partygoers:</font> Just Jamie (Three, four, or even 
five-sheets-to-the-wind), Just Sonia (Common-sense Woman), Just Shafie (Lack of Common-sense Woman).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>A few minutes past 6:30, because of the late arrival of <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font> (Second Run!) (and 
because some little kids kept trying to give the hashers candy. All they wanted was beer!), the group gathered outside the 
hare’s new place on Larch Street. Some instructions for the newer folks were given. The hare dangerously omitted warnings 
about following <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Perhaps the hash should start 
with a written disclaimer. We might still have <font color="#FF0000">Just Ariana</font> (second run, pending), then! Off 
at 6:45, they turned west on Larch and ran, dodging trick-or-treaters.</p>

<p>The hash started with a loop. What else would you expect from this hare? He had to draw it out somewhat. But it 
inevitably led to enough confusion that the group milled around for quite a while. Finally a few marks were found. They 
proceeded slowly and also inevitably down the hill to Camp Street, and the East Side’s only ghetto. <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> down Abbott and turned left onto a path to some playing fields. There was a bridge 
crossing Cypress Street. The Bridge was unlit. There were 15-20 youths on the bridge. In the dark. They were not 
trick-or-treating. They were not in costume. They might have been “wearing colors”. Most of them would have set off 
metal-detectors, had any been present. And we’re not talking bling, either!</p>

<p>Fortunately for the hash, the yutes were not prepared for the sight of lights with accompanying whistles running 
towards their turf. They rapidly dispersed.  But many of them stayed on the edges of the ‘hood to watch. They quickly 
realized that it was only a bunch of idiots. They started to regroup. Again fortune favored the hash as the sight of <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> in tinfoil gave enough pause to allow the last of the hashers to pass on through.</p>

<p>Trail continued up and down the hill, centered mostly on Camp Street. The crowds of kids in costume were larger, and 
some tried to run along with the group. The adolescents were particularly impressed by <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> 
and his Gay superhero outfit. Quite a codpiece! His virtue was only saved by <font color="#FF0000">DFF</font> and his 
five-foot skunk tail. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> found the trail out, passing a large puddle (the only shiggy to 
be seen, this evening). He led the pack to Olney Street, then correctly guessed that the hare intended to run the pack on 
Thayer. He continued south on Brown Street. He soon was lost in the fields of Hope High School. <font 
color="#FF0000">Ambiguously Gay man</font> to the rescue!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> turned left on Barnes. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed. But they were too 
early. They lost marks at Barnes and Hope. Milling about allowed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font> (Run #2!) to catch up. And the hare was then 
sighted, resetting his own trail. What a wank! <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led the charge down Thayer Street, 
passing students, vagrants, and drunkards fast enough that, initially speechless, they were fully prepared to make 
cat-calls for the Tattooed Lady’s lingerie, and the Gay Crime-Fighter’s codpiece.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> 
kilt was admired for its authenticity. There was a bit of a breeze.</p>

<p>But what of <font color="#FF0000">The Tin Man</font>? DFL, he was wracking his brains for a way to get out of this and 
return to the hare’s. He knew there was beer there. He knew there was an 80% chance he would not find the beer check. He 
knew how to get to the hare’s from Thayer Street. Thus he soon made a quick reversal and turned down Lloyd, crossed 
through Moses Brown School (passing immediately adjacent to the Beer check), and headed back north on Hope to the hare’s 
house. Unfortunately, thinking that this was the way it was supposed to be, the virgin <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Jennie</font> followed. She followed <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>! Sure, and SHE’LL be back (for a second run)!</p>

<p>Trail turned east on Euclid, past Wheeler School, and continued east on Angell. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
was back in the lead, but was soon fooled by a check on Arlington. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> took over and led 
north on Arlington with <font color="#FF0000">DFF</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font> (the two-timer!). At 
Lloyd, a check led into Moses Brown at the Baseball field, and some confusion with fences and blind trails at the top of 
the old sledding hill. <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font> (this was her second 
run!) finally found marks on Weymouth. These led to a “BN” pointing back into the woods. And a tipsy monk pointing the 
way, calling the group the “Hashish Harriers”! The hare had apparently just tried to lay claims of paternity upon this 
bystander. But the beer-near sign was too tempting, and they didn’t stay to talk.</p>

<p>The BC was found with the hare, at some picnic tables behind the Quaker Meeting House in some sparse woods. <font 
color="#FF0000">DFF</font>, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> spread out into the 
bushes trying to find the beer. The hare, sitting atop a picnic table, had a cup of beer in his hand. He had been 
fiendishly clever. He hid the beer in a bag right next to his feet, on the bench of the table. Genius! They still would 
have been looking for it, had not <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> accidentally sat on it. Soon they were all drinking 
Trinity IPA, singing and enjoying themselves. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, Ben and <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> were missing. O, the hashing life, Tra-La! But sadly, a frustrated Seamus finally dragged Basket to the BC. Poor 
dog! What a life he must lead!</p>

<p>Luckily, the beer was almost finished. Even <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> could not prolong the BC with the same 
old stories and songs. Beer gone, the hare mentioned that he had not really bothered to set trail back to his house. He 
gave bizarre and incomprehensible directions back to his place, involving Morris Avenue and the Brown Stadium. Perhaps he 
had hoped that some would become lost, and he might be able to economize on beer at the circle. But even half-minds could 
figure this one out (Brown Stadium = Jewish Temple. D’uh!), and they made their way back to Larch Street and the circle on 
the balcony.</p>

<p>The circle was formed. Some non-runners watched: <font color="#FF0000">Just Jamie</font> had been watching the fort 
(and the beer) for the hare during the run. She was joined by <font color="#FF0000">Just Sonia</font>, who was watching 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Jamie</font> (and her beer). At any rate, they refused efforts to involve them in the 
proceedings, claiming the sanity defense. Ratings for the run were colored by the excellent costumes, the fine beer and 
the holiday atmosphere. All were positive. Total: <b>-6.9</b>! Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> for not 
being ambiguous enough and for not having his other half present. The virgin was queried, and got none of the three 
(five) questions right. (Good material! SHE’LL show up again! Right!) </p>

<p>New arrivals <font color="#FF0000">Mother Goose</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bungy</font> rolled in, bringing with 
them the hirsute lady in pink, <font color="#FF0000">Just Shafie</font>. Efforts were made to hear excuses for lack of 
recent attendance. But as they appeared disinclined to put up with what was becoming a rather unruly circle, this issue 
was not forced. The circle was finished. <font color="#FF0000">Just Jamie</font> complained that all this circling 
business was making her dizzy. And nauseated. It couldn’t have been the beer. She wisely used the bathroom to empty her 
stomach. Dinner was almost ready. A varied collection of food was brought out and the beer continued to flow. A fine time 
was had by all, although the hare needs to get a DVD player if he wants to see any Talking A**holes on screen and not 
just in person.</p>
