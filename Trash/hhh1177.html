style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">OK. We had it 
coming. We showed up. Could there be any greater lapse in judgment than to show 
up for a <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> hash starting from his own home? Do we 
never learn? Already, this write-up is longer than the trail! But the RIH3 has 
to maintain its perfect run record, and so despite the risk of alienating any 
visitors or virgins, we continue to allow <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> to 
“set” trail. (Nice knowing you, <FONT color=#ff0000>Good Pie 
Hunting</FONT>!)<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hare claimed 
that his grandchildren actually set the marks, so for a brief shining moment it 
seemed as though there was some hope. Wrong! The crabapples don’t fall too far 
from the tree it seems. Trail (I take certain liberties in naming it thus) went 
up Meadow, and degenerated into a series of checks which led to falsies marked 
with vituperative adolescent comments in flour in the middle of the road. 
(“Wrong!!!”, “You blew it!!!”, “Ha, Ha!”, “Try again”, etc.) There was no true 
trail. There was no beer check. There was a brief run around the block followed 
by some beer with a girlishly giggling <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> in the 
garage.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Not much more to 
say here. Except, whatever you may think, no matter how much the itch to hash 
has you in its spell, no matter how much you need to get out of the house and 
away from your significant other, even if you room with JIMA, no matter how much 
your church-going has convinced you of the worthiness of any human being, even 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, DON’T EVER COME TO A <FONT 
color=#ff0000>BONDO</FONT> HASH IN WOONSOCKETagain! Have I made myself clear? 
DON’T DO IT! NO! NO, NO, NO! DON’T! JUST SAY NO! NYET! NEIN! NON! (I believe I 
just broke the exclamation mark on my keyboard. Sorry.)<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

formed. In the history of the RIH3 there has only been one other score to 
compare. A <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> “run”, of course. Total: -6969^69. 
Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Scatwoman</FONT>, I believe because she said 
she enjoyed the run, or something. The visitor left early, complaining of shin 
splints. They finished up and moved upstairs for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> spaghetti, football and a pool game between <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Cumsocket To Me</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Home
