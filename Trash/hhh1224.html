Balls</FONT> to <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Keri</FONT>, the hare set a short, but 
redundant trail in Uxbridge, starting from Hanna’s Place. Most parked following 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO’s</FONT> lead, in the adjacent parking lot for the 
currently vacant real restaurant the name of which escapes me. The hare arrived 
in time to give some instructions to the pack, and they were off. Trail led 
initially west, behind Hanna’s.</FONT></SPAN><SPAN

color=#000000>Soon, marks led them back, across the street and northwest on Balm 
of Life Spring Road. A check caused some confusion. Soon, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Pat</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> found true 
trail heading northeast on the backside access road behind the truck depot. They 
soon found a river crossing, and led the pack into a bushwhack on the opposite 
side. Those that had done this trail before knew where this was going. A run 
through the old sand and gravel pits, up to the powerlines, down the powerline 
trunk back to another river crossing. Why do we 
bother?<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

river, a nervous kayaker packed up and left at the sight of <FONT

fleeter and more graceful <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi </FONT>and <FONT

view. And praise be! The beer check! <o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

(almost) was <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, who seemed to have difficulties 
negotiating the stream. But it was all a ploy, as he managed to pilfer the 
hare’s bugle, and make his way back to the east bank. Songs were begun and it 
was pleasantly childish as usual. And to top it off, who should show up but 
two-timer <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Jen</FONT>! The enterprising lass had arrived 
late and still managed to follow trail! A natural 
hasher!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

and energetic followed true trail east on the powerlines, crossing Quaker 
Highway and turning south in the woods. The hashers with any sense followed 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO’s</FONT> lead and backtracked on the backside access 
road to a brief tour of the tractor trailer graveyard, and out to Quaker 
Highway, and the cars. If only those young folks would take the time to read 
some of these Write-Ups, then maybe they wouldn’t be led astray so often. When I 
was a lad, I paid more attention to my elders, I can tell 
you!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

The trail was rated: pavement, no virgin territory, minimal shiggy were bad. 
But, no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, multiple bimbos, good beer, and silly 
youngsters that actually followed the On-In trail. Total: +0.69. Backsliders 
were punished, the wedding couple were punished, and the two-timer was 
chastised.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Another attempt was made 
to name <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Pat</FONT>. Good Luck! Pathetic!&nbsp;Hashit 
went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT>. Allright! Enough! I’m tired of having 
to explain that I can’t remember why someone gets hashit. I usually can’t even 
understand it when it happens, much less 4 months later. So quit yer 
bellyachin’! I’m sure <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> remembers why he got it. 
But he’s not talking.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
