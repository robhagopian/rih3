color=#000000>One is always tempted to waste an entire paragraph listing how 
many times the Burrillville Middle School has been used by <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> for a hash. Most of us have nightmares about this 
place, and most could run the area blindfolded. In fact, this may be a good idea 
for the next time he sets trail here. At least it would lead to some interest. 
But the hare is getting old. He gets lost in his own neighborhood not 
infrequently. And he claimed to have a new twist.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

two virgins showed up. Poor girls, what a way to start hashing! As always, trail 
started off at the east end of the parking lot. There was some initial off-trail 
shiggy. <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> of course, ignored this and just 
carried on on the loop trail inside the river. As always, there were some 
unnecessary river crossings. <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> chose to join 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, and ignore these.<SPAN

color=#000000>The pack finally came upon the Beer Check, and the hare. He was 
busy inflating two bed mattresses for a race down the river. After some beer and 
some singing, the mattresses were ready, and team captains <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT> chose 
sides. With <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> missing, and the hare abstaining, 
it made for five to a mattress. The girls felt a new surge in their already 
soaring popularity.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The race was marked by numerous snags, illegal team swapping, and 
gross cheating by<FONT color=#ff0000> Just Pat</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> won? I’d like to 
think it was a moral victory, at least. The hare met the teams and the floats 
were deflated, with some more beer distributed. As always, the circle was moved 
to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>’s, and held in the ice-cold swimming pool. 
Ratings for the run: the only thing saving the hare was the30% bimbo factor, the 
mattress-thing being considered racist. Total: -6.9. The virgins were queried, 
and told a joke. They promised to come back after their upcoming deployment. 
Right. Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Need I say more? 
Finally, the grill was going, the beer was tapped and the evening ended on a 
mellow note.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
