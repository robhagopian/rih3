<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Mid 50's, Partly Cloudy<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD, Birdbrain, Dr WHO, Async, Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Basket

<font color="#0000FF">Theme:</font> None, unless <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> wants to celebrate the 73rd anniversary 
of the conversion of the &quot;Bank of Italy&quot; to the &quot;Bank of America&quot;.<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><br>A counterclockwise loop, entirely uphill, designed to befuddle the elderly and decrepit <font color="#FF0000">
(Basket)</font> among us. First crossing Taunton Ave and north for 20 yards then east, uphill. Trail led then south and 
east, uphill approaching Rt 495 and curving east and north uphill into some shiggy which allowed <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> to baptize <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> as well as to expedite the loss of <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> who short-cutted as usual to avoid getting his feet wet. Along the general path of the Warner Trail north, 
and uphill, the stream was crossed on a bridge, numerous zigzaging checks were negotiated and a cliff known as the 
&quot;Pinnacle&quot; was reached, only to find that there was NO BEER HERE (as well as to lose <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> who inexplicably joined <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, shortcutting uphill to a &quot;BN&quot; on the west 
side of the forest and, finding no BN, frolicking through the woods with <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and Seamus 
gaily for hours after all the others had had their beer and returned uphill to the parking lot and begun to circle but I 
digress). There were multiple uphill opportunities for <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>to fall into mud and hidden 
swamps, but <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> wasn't there so <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO, Oozing</font> and<font 
color="#FF0000"> Birdbrain</font> had to substitue and they did. They headed west uphill. They turned south uphill. 
Finally, a brief downhill segment led to the BN sign, then south to a stream, whence they went uphill, to the BC. Beer was 
had by all save <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, who were climbing hills 
elsewhere in the forest. After a protracted stay at the BC, the hashers turned uphill north, all save <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> missing the turn west to the cars, led by the nefarious and disoriented hare futher uphill 
into the wilderness until <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>'s probation ankle bracelet sounded a warning signal that he 
was passing out of his range limits and he directed the group back south and west uphill to the cars. Or whatever.<br><br>

Ratings: A unanimous 69! Until <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> found their way 
back up the hill, resulting in an unfortunate downgrade to 6.9.<br><br>

Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font> No, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>. No, <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font>. No,<font color="#FF0000"> Basket.</font><br><br>

On On On: Box Seats. No (closed at 9 PM because no one in Attleboro watches Monday Night Football in a sports bar), The
