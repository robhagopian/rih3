Directions were elusive, PG had even resorted to posting a pleading message on the board seeking info asap and this was followed by Amish posting a promise to get better info out about his run, either before or after his event. So, as most hashers lay in bed dreaming of whenst we would be graced with the info, Fuwangi actually managed to get something out at midnight Sunday.<br><br>

Waking on Monday morning was like Christmas Day all over again, the anticipation was huge, where was it going to be? Will it be at a place that we like? Will it be the same old crap with a visit to Coventry? Or perhaps it’ll be “on Island”? The latter was the case and the directions, meaningful and all, did have that FU twinge to them to such an extent that one might wonder if one should actually even show up. But this was true FU style, and he welcomed all turteen of us with open arms, as we made our way around numerous road detours like a rat in a maze. Speaking of amazing, Hairy completed an amazing feat with his inability to stay on the Island after arriving there for free, he actually entered via Route 24 and proceeded to Newport trying to find America’s Cup Ave, as this was
the start point of FU’s directions. A miserable effort saw Hairy  inadvertently travel over the Newport Bridge, which cost him $4, then the nice man at the toll booth told him he couldn’t do a U-Turn which resulted in the departure of another $4 from his pocket as he made his way back to the Island in spectacular tourist fashion. Well done Hairy, it almost
deserves a story of its own.<br><br>

Other late cummers included Basket and Crotchy, the latter being the usual one to be last to the start. Trail markings were explained and we listened intently for the description of the BN mark, there would be one tonight and the placement of the flour would be so fresh that one would almost be able to smell the biscuit in the oven. With the sounds of
waves crashing against the rocks and the gentle hum of construction equipment working overtime, the pack headed out and made their way through the park. SheMail was quickly on a check, the trail took a right and most of the pack followed. We meandered our way through stone walls, bushes, grass and flour only to reach the thorny bush area. Hairy was
returning from a dead end, cursing under his breath as he removed several sharp points from his skin.<br><br>

WHO was seen pondering the placement of the beer, and it didn’t seem to add up. His internal compass told him the beer near should be at the base of this large castle structure that he was standing at, but it wasn’t so he continued on trail. Little did he know that the hare had not placed the marking at that spot yet, for fear of it being seen to early. Does this make WHO’s compass a time travel machine, because it allows him to move forward in time and usually drink beer and eat orange food before the rest of us get there? Perhaps there is an idea for a TV show in there somewhere?<br><br>

The pack climbed the stairway to heaven, opened a few IPA’s and began singing as if this were some kind of end of the world event. The songs continued for a long time, probably because Basket sang a solo the words of which completely fail me right now. FU eventually told us it was time to leave, we circled up beside an 8 ft high wall that Basket failed to climb, he returned to the ground having left shards of skin on the wall.
This was enough reason to give him Hash Shit for the night, and so it was.<br><br>

We retired to KJ’s for some warm food around a really big table.
