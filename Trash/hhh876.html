<p><font color="#0000FF">Run #876</font>, February 10, 2003</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Scribe: </font>THE Raging ‘Snow Hare’ Queen of Beers<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Johnston/Cranston or one of those places, just off 295 on the Plainfield Pike<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Upper 20’s, Light Snow<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Dr WHO, Birdbrain, WIPOS, Oozing SD, SESYB, Bondo Jovi, Fuwangi Boner.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hounds-of-spring-pulling-upon-winters-traces:</font> Seamus, Jake, Ben.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Commemorating:</font> The spy exchange of U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers for Rudolph Abel (although 
what the hell this has to do with anything, I’m sure I don’t know. Didn’t the hare know that this was also the anniversary 
of the world premier of “My Friend Flicka” on CBS? Much more relevant.)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Consider the following words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outstanding</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incredible</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brilliant</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Superb</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well-conceived</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incomparable.</p>

<p>NONE of these could be used to 
describe the hash of February 10, 2003. Well, maybe incomparable. But not in a 
good way, if you know what I mean. Try: incompetent, pointless, pathetic, 
worthless, unnecessary, or insipid (How do you like that one! I got it from my 
P-Chem text: “In the final analysis after all, ethyl-tri-chloro-acetate is at 
best an insipid catalyst…). This might give you the idea. The usual crowd 
gathered at a snow covered driveway leading to an old Elks (or Freemasons, or K 
of C, or whatever) lodge. The weenies got frightened that their wimpy cars might 
get stuck in the snow, so they parked in the middle of the unplowed road right 
next to the Plainfield Pike. I guess this was in case they had to flag down a 
Girl Scout or something if they got stuck. I had heard it was to be a Spy hash, 
so I wore my Alpenkorps camouflage and scouted things out before I joined the 
group. They all acted like they couldn’t see me for the whole hash. Fine with 
me. I hate when <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> or <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> tries to bum a Bud Light out of my stash.</p>

<p>After some worthless 
instructions to look for paper or footprints or whatever, they were off.
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> decided to use his cross-country skis, the 
rest were on foot. They wore ski masks, and balaclavas, and tried to look 
mysterious. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> managed to look a little crazed, 
like Bill Cosby when he’d really had enough of Robert Culp.
<font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain</font> looked like Matt Helm off the sauce. For 
some reason, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> looked a bit like Annette 
Funicello (in that one where she goes skiing in Sun Valley with Tommy Kirk, but 
Don Rickles decides she’s a spy or something). <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
as always looked annoyed to be there, perhaps a vexed Fat Bastard.
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> looked like a confused, overweight Hymie the 
Robot. (That’s like a trivia test for you wanks, you know!) But no one looked 
like a spy. Actually, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>did look a tiny bit 
like an aging Mata Hari in a winter labcoat. But he doesn’t count.</p>

<p>They ran north on the driveway 
briefly, then turned right into some meadows. A small baby opossum or maybe a 
big mother rat blocked the trail, holding us up for a minute. I mean those 
things carry diseases and stuff. There were no marks. Footprints were all that 
could be followed. I led naturally, totally unseen, and tried to leave a bunch 
of false trails to screw everyone up good. Trail led along the shore of the 
Simmons Lower Reservoir. A quick falsie sent <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
down into a gravel pit. This must be like his most favorite place in the world 
by now. He spends more time in gravel pits than Barney Rubble. Everyone else 
watched his flashlight down in the bottom of the pit. They commented unfavorably 
on his form as he stumbled and shouted: ”On TWO! On two!” The hare provided 
unfair hints for <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing,</font> and they turned back northwest. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
couldn’t take advantage of his speed on skis because he kept getting tangled in 
bushes. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>couldn’t take advantage of his 
superior hashing abilities, because he HAS NONE! (Ha, Ha! Some joke, huh!)</p>

<p>Well, if you were designing 
your RIH3 typical trail, what would you put in now? That’s right, a freakin’ 
powerline. Trail turned away from the Reservoir and headed northeast on a 
powerline, leading to a menacingly well-lit powerplant. The hare started to act 
funny. He started to pretend he was James Bond in that scene where he sneaks up 
on and jumps Pussy Galore in Goldfinger’s stable. Except for the snow. And there 
were no stables. And he jumped <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. And he’s no 
James Bond that’s for sure. But maybe he was just ‘shaken not stirred’ at birth.
<font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain, Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
started to get into it, too. If the <font color="#FF0000">Hoover </font>had just 
worn a long blonde wig and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had gone Afro, 
they would have been the spitting image of the Mod Squad. Except LA doesn’t get 
this kind of snow. Lots of the other kind, though, as <font color="#FF0000">
Async </font>can tell you.</p>

<p>I was getting good and tired of 
this by now. I decided to take some long thin boards and make fake X-Country ski 
tracks all over the place. Poor <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> thought he 
could always backtrack if he got lost. Ha! That’s why I was voted most likely to 
succeed at oxidative phosphorylation in my Biochem class. The rest went east, 
over a giant, ice-crusted pile of gravel and onto Scituate Ave. The hare said 
the beer would be found in some Al Qaeda caves. Ooh, were we scared! We soon 
found that we were at a Cox Cable Building, undergoing extensive sewer 
renovations because of severe overuse. (I guess <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
has been visiting <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> at work again.) Beer was 
found in a large pipe near a backhoe. They could hardly drink any ‘cause they 
all kept cracking up over stupid jokes (“<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> a 
Ho”, “Come back, Ho!”, “A Backhoe for the Crack Ho”, and on and on until I 
wanted to puke).</p>

<p>The beer was the usual swill: 
Trinity Barleywine. Barleywine and a snowy night! The hare obviously has 
something against <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. Why don’t you just kick 
him with the poisoned knife hidden in the toe of your high heels, for cryin’ out 
loud. I stuck with my Bud Light, and waited with the rest for
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> to arrive. But who should show up, but
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> dressed as Derek Flint, even though he 
probably doesn’t have a clue what I’m talking about. He said he had seen
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> back by the factory, but thought some KAOS 
agents might have got him. Well, we only wait so long when we know the wanker 
has cab fare. They said, “At least he can always follow his tracks backwards.” I 
chuckled, secretively like a real spy.</p>

<p>Trail back led along the 
embankment high above Rt 295. It was pretty dull and straightforward once you 
got past the part where you were in danger of slipping down the slopes into the 
traffic. The hare backtracked a bit to look for <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, 
but got bored and rejoined the pack as they turned west to the reservoir. The 
trails crossed at this point. Luckily, the trails were so poorly marked no one 
got confused by actually trying to follow trail. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
led across the ice, running fast so’s not to crack through.
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain</font> 
chased him, so he started farting like crazy and trying to light the gases with 
a match. Obviously, he was trying that thing that James Bond did, where he lit 
the gasoline on the lake from his speedboat, killing all the bad guys behind 
him. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>gave up, and tackled
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> instead. They shared a special moment. The 
hare was jealous and tried the same on <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>a 
moment later, but the big mother rat tripped him and he ended up with his nuts 
in a pricker bush. (How many times has that happened this week!)</p>

<p>Anyways, they gathered in the 
driveway to circle up. But still no <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. They 
started anyways, and I slipped off into the night because no one had seen me yet 
and I only had two Buds left. I figured they would try to steal them for the 
down downs. I heard later that they gave the run a +6.9 for beer (Yah, right!), 
weather and losing <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>(yippee!), but then 
downgraded it to –0.69 when <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> finally showed 
up. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> must’ve got the hashit because I heard 
she flashed the Mobil station, sending secret messages using her Captain 
Midnight&nbsp; “moon-light decoder ‘ring’”. They rendezvoused for dinner at some 
cheap dive in Cranston known only by a secret sequence of numbers that the hare 
f*cked up anyways.&nbsp; But you can’t lose hashers in search of cheap food and beer, 
so they all ended up the night with another bad case of indigestion and diarrhea 
and with vows to stop coming on Monday nights except when the Raging Queen of 
Beers sets one of his masterpiece trails of course when everyone wants to be 
there to share in the sublime experience (Got that one from Organic: “Carbon 
tetrachloride is some sublime kind of solvent…”).</p>
