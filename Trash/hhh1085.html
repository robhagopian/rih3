<p>I don’t remember this run, except that it was dark, the marks were invisible, and (I think) we made a counterclockwise 
circle, with a fair amount of bushwhacking, and the hare losing his own trail. Business as usual. The start, off North Shore 
Drive at Spring Lake, was to be repeated by the same hare (trying to get it right this time) in August. That one was only 
better because of the presence of quality bimbos. The hare has learned nothing. But he is free to add his recollections to 
make this an actual write-up. I’m sick of it all!</p>
