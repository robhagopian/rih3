<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">My journey began in Newport at 5:30, it gave me
an hour to find the pack. This wouldn’t have been a problem except that
the last 16 miles were on a 25/35 mph road. Anyway, with cold nervous sweat
running down the back of my neck and into the crack in my wallet, I found
the pack of four huddled in some bushes muttering tales of past runs. I
was greeted with “What da fuck are you doing all the way up here” little
did I know that things would get worse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The motley crew had been briefed and the hare
was going to run with the pack accompanied by a six pack on his back. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was on true trail immediately, his tell tale flashing red lights (located
on his derriere) were a beacon of hope on some occasions. Quick as a flash
we were in the woods, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The Hopeless one</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
sought out the flour whereas </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Uuuuzie</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was looking skyward and admiring the starry starry nite. The first check
had us spread out as far as 4 hounds can spread out, eventually </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
got us back on trail. This was potentially the first opportunity to legitimately
whine on this fair night, but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was having none of it. Across the foot bridge brought us from RI to CT
without a toll (obviously a loophole that the RI Politicians have not closed).
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> had taken
to the high ground because of his familiarity with the area, it later transpired
that this was complete and utter bullshit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">By this time the pack had split, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozie</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was trying to find a payphone, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was trying to find trail and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
said lets go to the covered bridge as he will probably do the beer stop
there. And so it was, the beer was warm, ten years old and came in twist
off tops (more whining). We all agreed that second helpings of same would
go to improve the average rating this run would receive, however the Hare
was not impressed with our invitation to the Lincoln (RI) bedroom and refused
our bribe. More whining followed and then we moved on in search of Beer
Stop #2 which was also the end of the run. The beer was carefully concealed
in a trash can that had the hallmarks of also being the local piss house
for the rabid dogs of the area. Nonetheless we consumed the brew and began
more whining. Most memorable down-down went to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
for imitating a fish out of water when he dribbled the suds down his front.
Hash Shit went to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and
since </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">is
writing this trash I can truthfully say, Up yours….See ya soon! The On-On
was at an establishment that was closing for renovations as soon as we
finished our beers, Pool is free there on Monday nights and the clientele.…well
they were all pissed as newts. The combined IQ was somewhere in the 69
range or was that the channel they were watching on TV </FONT></P>
