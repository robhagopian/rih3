The Run: We should've known this trail was shit when we arrived to WHO explaining the sample marks, which of course included some Boston ones. No hare in sight, as he was setting some of the trail live, likely due to procrastinating. Still, we set out at 6:30 and made our way around the parking lots. Initially it was a fairly normal trail with a "view" of the parking lot, followed by normal bushwhacking, which led into shitty bushwhacking. After spending tirty minutes in between a very steep hill and a mucky swamp, we emerged to a trail near the power lines.<br/><br/>

All this time we had seen some strange marks. The usual toilet paper and flour, but also crushed up crackers and purple chalk. These types of marks continued throughout the trail, though they somehow managed to get shittier. Basket managed to find a tiny check drawn in chalk on a rock that couldn't be longer than 3 inches and marveled at how big it was compared to what he was used to. After recreating an actually visible check in the dirt, we continued winding back and forth across the power lines and eventually made it to the quarry, where the beer stop was expected to be.<br/><br/>

This shitty trail could only be culminated with shitty beer, but the hare surprised us with an abundance of 16oz Captain's Daughter and other unexpectedly good beers. After spending some time worrying Rusty by me standing too close to the edge, we eventually left and returned to the parking lot. We watched a worker clean up trash in the parking lot as we rated the trail, which was a very generous -6.9 somehow. A few people went to Chilis afterwards because it was the only place that was open, which is a fitting end for the desperation of this trail.<br/>
