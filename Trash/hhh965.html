<p><font color="#008000">Run # 965,</font> October 4, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Tinker</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Francis C. Carter Preserve, Charlestown</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 60’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Oozing SD, SESYB, Dr WHO, Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS, 
PW, Just PW’s Friend, Seamus, Ben. Virgins: Just Sarah, Just Bert [Your scribe apologizes for his confusion with 
names, but he’s a wanker, and has a short attention span after 6 PM.]</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Starting from a small parking area maintained by the Nature Conservancy off Carolina Back Road (Rt 112), the laws 
of man and nature alike were violated immediately with the arrival of the hashers. Two virgins made their appearance 
independently against all reason. Courageous? Maybe. Stupid? Definitely! All were soon to regret their rash behavior.</p>

<p>Trail led straight out into the Preserve, heading northwest. A few checks led to some pointless bushwhacks to the 
right and left of the single trail. The newcomers and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> obliged by checking these 
out. There was no appreciable shiggy, although a small dry stream was crossed. It was soon clear to <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> that keeping on trail and ignoring the checks was 
the way to go. As such, in less time than it has taken to write this paragraph, they followed trail curving back south 
west to the hare’s car and the beer check on the Narragansett Trail.</p>

<p>The rest of the runners gradually trickled in.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>made it in. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> did not get lost. And after the beer was delivered from the hare’s trunk, a new light was 
seen approaching on the trail. The news couldn’t have been worse!  <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> had returned for 
the second time in less than a month. (And brought a friend who had hashed with the RIH3 at least once before, but who 
concealed his name from your scribe for no doubt excellent reasons.) The situation called for strong action. So singing 
started. The newcomers were impressed with the harmonies of the Little Bird Song.</p>

<p>There were now three choices: a) trail east would lead back to Rt 112, and the cars, b) the hare indicated that 
true trail led west, beyond the gate on the Old Mill Road, or c) the beer was in the trunk of the hare’s car, and showed 
no signs of budging. Naturally, most made the wrong decision, and continued on trail. One might think that the 
preceding ¾ of a mile of trail would have been enough, but no! Words come to mind. Intrepid! Fearless! Adventuresome! 
Moronic!</p>

<p>Trail then continued slightly north of west on the dirt road. A check led left with alternatives to the right 
and straight causing dispersion of the pack. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> found an arrow into the woods and, 
followed by one of the virgins, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, they went off on a merry bushwhack through a pine grove filled with downed trees, briars 
and poison ivy. Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> continued straight and took a right on the now paved road. 
She followed the crashing, cracking and cursing sounds from the safety of this road but she soon turned into the woods 
to join the main group. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> found the exit 
arrow on the road and returned east to a check by the powerlines. They now had trouble finding trail again. What a 
surprise!</p>

<p>The confusion allowed time to regroup, and mill about aimlessly. The check was finally mastered by <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, realizing that the eastward trail on the powerlines had to lead back. The first mark was 
found finally, 400yds up the powerlines, and all were called on trail. The path climbed to the top of a 170ft hill, and 
began to descend.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> heard a sneeze in the woods to his left. He still didn’t have 
sense enough to turn that way at the next check: the intersection of the Narragansett Trail and Old Mill Road. He and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>continued straight while the rest dealt more successfully with the challenge.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a back check was discovered.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> returned to the sounds of the whistles.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>continued straight. The group turned on its heels and soon came to the hare’s car. 
The hare was there. <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> was there, with his friend. The beer was there, but considerably 
reduced by the attentions of the three non-participants. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> continued straight. The 
few remaining beers were being guarded for the circle, so it was with some impatience that the group awaited his return.
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> realized with a start that he was back at the original beer check. Talk about short 
attention spans! <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>finally turned around and came back.</p>

<p>The circle was joined. Ratings for the run: no shiggy, too long, lousy weather, <font color="#FF0000">PW </font>
arriving, beer shortage, and lack of checks were balanced by virgins, including a bimbo, a good and completely 
unnecessary bushwhack, and no North-South Trail. Total: -0.69! Hashit went from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> again. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
doesn’t know why (or care). On On On was at the Wood River Inn, a pleasant change from Marks for the hashers (although 
NOT for the Wood River Inn). Both virgins guaranteed to return. We’ll believe it when we see it. But if they do, the 
scribe will get their names right, and they can see their names go into history as part of the RIH3. [Tip: Don’t 
think about running for major office if the scribe gets your name right.]</p>
