<p><font color="#008000">Run #1093</font>, March 12, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Bondo Jovi</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Lincoln, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 40s, clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish, Oozing, Dr. WHO, Basket, Dry Foot, Eenie Weenie Dick, Justin My Ass, 
Seamus.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>As the first hash of daylights savings, we all had hope of good things to come.  But, since this is the hash the only 
thing to be expected is the unexpected.  Or something.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> arrived early at The Lodge in Lincoln to see <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> heading out the rear (weird, he usually heads up the rear, but I digress) of the parking lot with Ben and flour in 
hand.  Actually, flour in hand and Ben on leash, but you get the idea.  Our initial comments were – “wow, <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> not setting a hash from his house, how bizarre.”  We would later wish he’d take his normal 
lazy route and rounded case de <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> instead.  As <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> showed up, some secondary comments came up 
related to a series of text messages sent from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> phone in regards to his love of the 
male anatomy and his desire to have his orifices violated.  Not that this surprised us.  And just like that the hash was 
off, heading into the woods behind the Lodge.</p>

<p>A first check was found at the entrance of the woods, with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and Seamus heading to 
the right/north with <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> while the rest went left/west.  Soon enough after, horn blasts 
from the north had the pack bushwhacking to the other trail and an eventual circle jerk back to Breakneck Rd had us at a 
check.  Obviously, the correct route was into Lincoln Woods.  With the previous weekend’s high temps and rain all snow and 
frozen ground had thawed leaving a slippery mess.  And leaving <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> previously set marks 
vague and sometimes washed out.</p>

<p>Trail continued southeast, along the sides of the pond and down into the lowlands.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
continued out front while <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> rounded up the rear.  
The rear – which apparently is <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> orifice of choice.  Heading to the right and then 
right again uphill (almost matching mark for mark Cumunder’s virgin hare in this same park, and yes – I am serious) before 
coming to a split in the trail without marks.  This was soon to be a common scenario on this trail, but apparently to 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> this should not have been a problem.  Of course, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
never follows marks anyway so <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> listens to him.  Actually, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
doesn’t.  Or something.</p>

<p>Downhill to the parks areas had us come upon a single mark and no more, but we pushed on assuming <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> had taken the easy, and previously traveled, route.  To the ball park and then right on-road was the way for 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font>.  Once 
again <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was long gone.  After the pack had spread far and wide (far and wide – a 
necessary position for the action <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> requested in one of his text messages) <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> finally found a mark uphill and far from where we were standing.</p>

<p>A continuation through the woods had us finally come out onto Table Rock Rd, although no marks had been seen after the 
initial one spotted by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, a check was found at the base of a tree.  Searching in the woods 
without luck, the pack traveled right up Table Rock Rd.  By this time the daylight was as nonexistent as the marks, so all 
decided to follow the same trail as <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder’s</font> previous run hoping we’d happen upon 
something.  Negative.  With a right off Table Rock Rd back into the woods the group traveled round and round, listening 
for horns, looking for marks, until it was decided that the best thing to do was head back to the Lodge for a beer.  
Heading northwest towards the car, the group made an incorrect turn west, and back down to Table Rock Rd.  Realizing that 
the longer we wondered around the woods the longer we’d have to wait to drink beer, down Table Rock Rd we went, under he 
covered bridge onto Manchester Print Rd and finally a left onto Great Rd/123.  By this time <font color="#FF0000">EWD
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had managed to get themselves separated by themselves (by accident, I 
think not!) and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were off by themselves (again, 
accident, I think not!) which left <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> to trudge up the miles of pavement of 123 towards the Lodge.  Nearly there (at 
Butterfly Way), <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were spotted in the woods.  
Shortly after, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> could be heard furiously blowing his horn trying to entice the group 
back into the woods.  Furiously blowing, somewhat like the action <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> likes to perform on 
the male member he loves?</p>

<p>With no more desire to walk in the unmarked woods and with a desire to drink some beers all but <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> continued to the Lodge where a quick circle was held and inside to the popcorn and beer they went.  
Eventually both <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> came in to let us know that 
the “official” circle had been formed, but considering the table held mostly full beers the rest decided that their brief 
version held before would be sufficient.</p>

<p>Once inside, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> informed all of his displeasure and disappointment.  No one paid 
attention.  The others informed <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> of his nomination for hashit due to his lovely phone 
messages.  He didn’t pay attention.  As we bickered the waitresses stood around the corner.  Not paying attention.</p>

<p>After some beers, popcorn and sandwiches all left to ponder by themselves the debacle that was this night’s hash.</p>
