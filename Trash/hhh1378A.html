Run# 1377B<br>
Chocorua Recovery Colt State Park, Bristol<br>
Hare: Ass Quack<br>
Pack: Crabby Shag, WHO, Basket, Shemale Man, Oozing, WIPOS, Mrs WIPOS, Flobanger, Butt Plug, Retard, Just Mark, Fuwangii, and late cumer Pat My Cravasse.<br>
Weather: Same as Sunday, Brilliant
Hashit: Wasn't determined, but should have been Madelyn or Mrs WIPOS for making a really big mistake 30 years ago, or Crabby for making the same one this weekend in MD. I'll accept for the lack of another wanker.<br><br>
The trail started out northerly from the southwest corner and we quickly ran out of flour. Following the speedster, Crabby led us like she knew where she was going. Unfortunately, she was as knowledgeable of the trail as she is about her future with AQ. She was well off flour by the time I shortcutted in front to ask her, and wondered why the rest of the pack followed her butt. Well, may that's not the right question.<br><br>
Eventually flour was found heading back southerly and into the woods at the southern end of the island. It wasn't long before I was following Flo in the back of the pack and eventually even he left me. I could hear him call off in the woods as I was just about to travel on private property. Going under a wire, I found myself alone in bull briers trying to find the trail Flo was on. It was a lost cause and I made my way, eventually, back to the road. Backtracking I found the error of my way and a lot of flour and unmarked checks. One check had 3 arrows, all in different directions (big help), but most were unmarked. I hit 4 false trail marks and eventually heard the pack off to my right. Going through another false trail mark, I was on the water and at the beer stop. <br><br>
Beers and orange food was enjoyed along with some singing and OOzing complaining about the nude photos of Harry in Las Vegas. I'm sure there were some important things discussed with the hurricane in LA and the Republican Convention, but WHO remembers that with all the complaining from OOzie.<br><br>
We made our way back to the cars, where it was decided that we should have a quick circle, since we haven't had a swing low in 3 weeks, save Chocorua, and the park police would be kicking us out as it was dark and the park was closed. Down down to the Hare and it was over as quickly as it started. We all made our way out the rear gate to Aidans in Bristol.<br><br>
After ordering beer and food, the wedding ceremony commenced. The bride wore a beautiful tiara with a white veil. The groom was dressed neatly in a black tie. Father Basket officiated the ceremony. Just as the groom was to kiss the bride, Pat My Crevasse hobbled in on crutches (we were on the second floor), with her nieces and a handful of bra's she knitted for the ladies of the Hash. Her discontent with OOzing was not easily concealed, as she had hoped to have him bring them to Chocorua for her, but as she was in the hospital, he didn't have time for her.<br><br>
Food arrived just after the ceremony and we enjoyed the wedding cake that OOzing made that afternoon. Another beer and it was all too soon that it was time to go home.
