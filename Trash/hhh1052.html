<p><font color="#008000">Run #1052</font>, May 29, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Visiting Scribe:</font>&nbsp; NEON</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; A parking lot off East Ave in Harrisville, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Sunny and cold enough to snow</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Oozing, G@GH, his pretty young thing, Dry Foot, Fuwangi, Just Joe 
the virgin, Seamus, and me, Neon, with my trusty friend Fufu, who just happens to be a lemur.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>It was a cold and dreary day along the Clear River, where a stellar pack of hounds came to join <font color="#FF0000">
Basket Boom Boom</font> on one of his legendary trails. Well at least it felt cold and dreary for someone from Panama, 
where the weather is always hot, so hot flesh could just melt off your body….but I digress, as you say in RI.</p>

<p>The pack was enjoying a light pre-lube of IPA and Stouts as <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived with his trusty 
pal Seamus. Having just completed setting the trail, he was covered in muck from his head to his toe and smelled like what 
Fufu leaves in the back seat of my rented car. A visitor arrived along with <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> just as 
the hare was giving instructions. The pack listened intently as <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> explained about having 
to reset trail after the previous days deluge, but he was sure we would all enjoy the trail none-the-less, as there would 
be not one but two beer stops.</p>

<p>We started out across the footbridge over the river and found trail leading counter clockwise around the pond. <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> led all crossing Steere St, then a right and left 
into a neighborhood of small cottages with strong men pushing lawnmowers and children playing in yards. It was quaint and 
wonderful and reminded me of my small village in Panama. Men mostly walk around without shirts, showing their manly chests 
and women sunbath in the nude. It’s really quite nice; you should go there.</p>

<p>At the next intersection a check was found that fooled no one, as all ran around the gate and uphill along an old dirt 
road. It was a simple road, with pot holes filled with rain water and fallen trees lay strewn about. It had us traveling 
behind those lovely cottages, and you could see the children playing there. Fufu was tightly wrapped around my neck and 
got so excited his bowls let go and he left another trail down my back, but I digress, as you say.</p>

<p>At the next intersection, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, who up till this time was following close behind me, so 
close I felt somewhat uncomfortable yet excited, as he passed me I caught his eyes leering down my plunging neckline, so I 
thrust my bosom high and smiled.  He checked left down a small hill, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> right uphill, 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> continued into a small grassy clearing. They 
seem to be very likeable and friendly, as they trotted off together, almost hand in hand. <font color="#FF0000">G@GH
</font> and his girl found true trail just down from the clearing where <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> were taking an awful long time to explore. I became quite hot at the thought of the two of 
them and their sweaty bodies that I had to run quickly downhill after the FRB’s to compose myself.</p>

<p>The trail crossed a small brook and turned left running parallel to the stream. It was soon overtaken by the flooded 
conditions and was a good foot to two underwater as we made our way forward. The marks were cleverly made with flour 
sprinkled on the leaves along the waters edge and reminded me of the parties we had as children in Panama. White powder 
was everywhere and we all had great fun. The pack stayed together and just as Basket had said, we were enjoying ourselves 
immensely.</p>

<p>Trail came out to a fishing area, turning right and right again up a steep hill through large boulders and trees. It 
was like standing above the canal, looking down at the water, where the bare chest men would fish and drink beer. And we 
did too, drink beer that is, at the very top of the hill. As were standing a between the rocks enjoying IPA, many songs 
were sung and the men played with my little Fufu. We were enjoying ourselves so much, that none wanted to leave, but as 
soon as the beer was finished <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> led the pack down the hill and back into the woods.</p>

<p>The pack stayed close together, talking to me and petting my little Fufu, until we came to the next check. Then the 
manly men ran right and left looking for trail, only to come back again and go straight out to East Ave. We were running 
west along East Avenue when the trail crossed the road and came out at the Burrillville High School. The next check was a 
bit more exasperating, but we eventually found marks leading around the school and down to the river. Here beer check #2 
was found and we all stood in the freezing water drinking and singing and petting my little Fufu. A couple of kayakers 
came by and made some complementary remarks about my breasts. As beer was finished again, we started out.</p>

<p>Trail led up to a closed landfill, around the fence and along an old trolley bed. It reminded me of the trains that 
were used to dig the canal back home that we now use for running on. It was a beautiful trail through the forest of tall 
oaks and might larch. We continued out to a new housing development, which led the pack out to an old mill village along 
the river and back to the start.</p>

<p>The pack packed up and drove back to <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> for the circle and post lube. Some late 
cumers showed and all poured a beer to celebrate the completion of a great trail. As we enjoyed his fresh keg of IPA, we 
all jumped into the pool and as the water temperature was quite cold, my nipples were trust out against my shirt. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> made a comment on it, so I showed him mine and he showed me his. Down-downs were given to 
the hare, the visitors, late cumers and virgin, and the Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, for 
doing something stupid on Trail. We then settled down to some great food and more beer. It reminded me of parties we had 
in Panama…..</p>
