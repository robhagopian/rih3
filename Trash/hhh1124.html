<p><font color="#008000">Run #1124</font>, October 15, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; The Slasher Dr W.H.O.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Abram’s Rock, Swansea, MA</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 50’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Concrete Feet, WIPOS, Just Rebecca, Basket Boom Boom, Just Miranda, Oozing 
SD, Async. Virgins: Just Therese (sp?),  Just Zeke.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> set the <b>Hash of the Year</b> this 
week! <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> is too old and lame to do this write-up, and he missed all the good parts 
anyways. So I’ll just have to come out of retirement and act as scribe. Don’t expect this again anytime soon. But as I 
said, this was the <b>Hash of the Year!</b> Don’t believe me, if you like. But I’ll prove it.</p>

<p>First: another run with three bimbos and two virgins. This was the fifth week in a row for virgins, so maybe the hare 
can’t take all the credit Could be some kind of weird subliminal advertising. Maybe that “On-On” foot I noticed at that 
great new coffee shop in Wayland Square, “The Edge”, is affecting peoples’ subconscious. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
knows!</p>

<p>Second: the start was designed to attract as little official attention as possible. Rather than going straight into the 
woods, and risking calls to the police from frightened librarians, the hare set trail out onto Main Road from the Swansea 
Library parking lot, turning right past the fire station and turning right again in the Middle School parking lot,, and 
into the woods.</p>

<p>Third: this was the only pavement seen on the run. I mean it! <b>Hash of the Year!</b></p>

<p>Fourth: Trail now entered the woods and almost immediately crossed a stream over a very deceptive log that led to 
almost certain immersion in some viscous mud. This was followed by the first of many false trails leading up a large 
“pudding rock”. Ooo, did <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> whine about this one!</p>

<p>Fifth: not only did <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> whine, but <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> proceeded to get 
lost! I’m telling you: <b>Hash of the Year!</b></p>

<p>Sixth: trail led north to a very confusing set of checks with at least one circle-jerk, and sufficient confusion to 
allow the group to pretty much come together as we entered a field. Now <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was able to 
catch up at this point, so you might subtract some points. But I feel this just proves what a good job the hare did. If 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> (a reasonable hasher) can find trail, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (a wank!) 
cannot, it seems that this almost defines the ideal trail.</p>

<p>Seventh: trail took a short bushwhack down and into a swamp. At least two people, as well as the hare, temporarily lost 
their shoes.  And this was not some long drawn-out <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> kind of swamp. Just a brief trip 
through the mud to a series of trails over palettes laid out to cross the worst of it. I unfortunately tried to short-cut 
at this point. I avoided some mud, but had more than my fill of briars. <b>Hash of the Year!</b></p>

<p>Eighth: trail curved east through a scented pine grove and came out to some powerlines! What would a RIH3 trail be 
without powerlines?! (Certainly NOT the <b>Hash of the Year!</b>) And the powerlines again intersected with a main 
trunkline, causing the group again to get more than slightly confused, and sending <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> off 
on his own. I was off trail too, but followed the sounds of the lead group as they re-entered the woods and continued 
southeast parallel to the powerlines.</p>

<p>Ninth: the complaints about too long trail began now. Take note of this, prospective hares. If you get to a beercheck 
before you get these tell-tale whinges, your trail is too short. In particular, <font color="#FF0000">Just Rebecca</font> 
was vocal about the excessive length, and she was starting to get physical with the hare, when <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> showed up. I’ll admit it. No trail is perfect. Not even the <b>Hash of the Year!</b></p>

<p>Tenth: the beer check was found, atop Abram’s rock, the largest of the “pudding rock” formations in the area. A scenic 
stop, the trail three-quarters done, fine beer choices in sufficient quantities, savory peanuts, a lost hasher, and some 
classic songs. <b>Hash of the Year!</b>  Perfection! Well, it would have been if the lost hasher had been <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, instead of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. But at least <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> wasn’t there!</p>

<p>Eleventh: the trail out was scenic, with just enough checks to be interesting, but not so long as to be a waste of 
time. The reality of course, is that the hare didn’t want to hike a long way when he’d brought his beer out. But he was 
still able to put enough distance to this segment that we all arrived at the cemetery north of the library parking lot 
with a bit of a thirst. He held us there out of sight of the parking lot, while he went and got some fresh beer for the 
circle.</p>

<p>Twelfth: the circle was controlled, but not overlong. The run was rated for most of the qualities I’ve mentioned above. 
Total: <b>+6.9!</b> The hare went out with a classic (“The Ring-a-rang-a-roo”) avoiding some of his more annoying efforts 
(“Poisoning Pigeons”, etc.) The virgins were questioned, and somehow Just Zeke knew to start the “Dough, the stuff that 
buys my beer...” song. Hashit went back to me, because I wanted it. I mean, it’s pretty cool, and all. Especially it’s 
contents.</p>

<p>Finally: the On-On-On was at Jillian’s Sports Pub in Somerset. Not too far, easy to find and inexpensive. The food was 
fine, the beer adequate and not too many food missiles were launched. The Red Sox lost, but the hare can’t handle 
everything!</p>

<p>So as you see, if you too want to set the <b>Hash of the Year</b>, take my advice and follow the guidelines above. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could have done it better?</p>
