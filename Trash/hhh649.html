Arcadia Management Area</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The hash congregated at the glowing pumpkin on the side of the road
along
<BR>the Acadia Park mismanagement area.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">OOzing</FONT>
was the Hare.&nbsp; If you didnt go
<BR>exactly 6.2 miles and see a pumpkin, you were hosed.&nbsp; Several
of the 9
<BR>hashers who attended drove by the start in the pitch black of night
and had
<BR>to turn around.&nbsp; Seems <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozing</FONT> was
not quite capable of buying a candle large
<BR>enough to make the dang pumpkin glow.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Cheap
Licker</FONT> apparently never made it
<BR>because she drove the 6.2 miles from the intersection and the pumpkin
was no
<BR>longer lit.&nbsp; Thats the last time she follows directions from Basket
she
<BR>said.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We set off on trail, attendees including <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">EB
Ripta, Hurling, Nippy,</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket, Tinker, Async, Bondo Jovi, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and</FONT><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">
Wipeus.</FONT>&nbsp; It was pretty damn dark and
<BR>equally as cold.&nbsp; Make sure you purchase the energizer batteries
before
<BR>heading out, if your flashlight dies your screwed.&nbsp; On and On
the trail went
<BR>with <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozing </FONT>prodding us along the way,
nothing like running a trail with a
<BR>damn Pakistani terrorist showing you where to run in the middle of
the night
<BR>with a flashlight.&nbsp; We had a nice beer stop on a huge rock overhanging
the
<BR>flowing water below.&nbsp; The full moon was quite nice as was the
beer and song
<BR>that ensued.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozing</FONT> sent us back
on trail as he got tired of the incessant
<BR>whining by <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">EB
Ripta</FONT> complained about the cold weather, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>
didnt
<BR>like the beer, and the rest of us didnt know the fucking lyrics to
the songs
<BR>that <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT> kept singing.&nbsp; We followed
trail about another 20 miles to the
<BR>end back at the original checkpoint by the cars.&nbsp; We sang a musical
review
<BR>relating mainly to women and the degradation thereof.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Hurling</FONT>
was called
<BR>into the circle to drink for being a wisitor.&nbsp; He mumbled some
excuse about
<BR>the Monday Night Football game being so lame that he decided to actually
<BR>hash with a bunch of wankers from our RI counterparts.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Nippy</FONT>
felt the same
<BR>way, or he would have been at the bar drinking beer and counting his
fantasy
<BR>football points.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Tinker</FONT> colored
his beard and was the only wanker to half
<BR>attempt a halloween costume, course he does that all by himself anyhow.
<BR><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT> continued to whine as we did the
10 words or less on the run circle.
<BR>Everyone seemed to agree that <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">OOzing</FONT> should
stick to his day job, course the
<BR>wankers from Rhode Island love to whine about every trail ever set.&nbsp;
After a
<BR>few down downs and the presentation of the toilet seat hashit to <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT>...
<BR>we ambled down the road to a local pub and drank and ate and carried
on.
