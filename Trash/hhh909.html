<p>Supposed to be a clockwise loop, but due to circumstances beyond the hare's control (because he's a wank!), ended up a 
counterclockwise jaunt of considerably less interest. Nevertheless, the most completely recycled run since <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> last Woonsocket run. It should have been: southeast on Rail grade, then east to Booth Pond, 
through some shiggy northwest to trail, to fork (used in March (#885) as the Turkey-Turkey split) to powerlines, up 
southwest to crest for BC, then down the cliff/scree and back northwest to rail grade and cars. Actually, the hashers all 
reversed the trail, and got to the beer with almost no effort. No one deigned to enter the shiggy. No one was attacked by 
vicious wasps or bees. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> found his horn in a tree.<br><br>
