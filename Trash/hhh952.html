<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">A to Z Hash</font><br>(Async to Zambarano)</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #952</font>, July 12, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare: </font>Async</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Buck Hill, Burrillville</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather</font>: High 70’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Dr WHO, Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, Fuwangi Boner, Oozing SD, Tinker, Ben, 
Seamus.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The run started from an abandoned road on the southbound side of Rt 100 about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of a mile south of 
the entrance to Zambarano Hospital. This is a former tuberculosis sanatorium and mental institution, now supposedly a 
rehab facility. A fitting start for the RIH3 with it’s collection of lame (<font color="#FF0000">Async, Bondo, 
Tinker)</font>, deranged (<font color="#FF0000">WHO, Oozing, WIPOS</font>), and phthisic (<font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>) runners. [<i>Ed Note: Actually, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>may qualify for all the above 
categories.</i>] At any rate, early arrivals <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
shared some beer with the hare, as the others straggled in one by one. They were prompt as always, and headed out on 
trail at six-thirty, north on the abandoned road.</p>

<p>Trail soon spit the hashers back out on the road.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried a few of the hospital roads 
but soon gave up. Oozing was directed by the hare, and turned west on a bushwhack, skirting the hospital property. 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>kept on going, marching to his own drummer as usual. The bushwhack was short and 
not very sweet, although there was a shortcut through some of the hospital garbage that  <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> managed to find. They came out to a road that led to the Benson Mountain Trail, continuing west.</p>

<p>They ran along with little difficulty as the trail was well-marked and unexciting. <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> remembered <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> last sojourn on this same trail, on a bike.  (He had headed 
for the CT border and missed the beer check.)  <font color="#FF0000">WHO </font>again tried the power of suggestion on
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and sent him back off to Connecticut in a vain search for beer. <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker h</font>ad fallen behind, and mistakenly followed the trail of <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font>. True trail was found by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>turning north on the North-South Trail.</p>

<p>After a brief spell on the NS trail, they passed the overgrown path along the ridge of the south shore of Wallum 
Lake. Soon thereafter trail turned into the woods, bushwhacking through some heavy brush eastwards. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing, Fuwangi </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> traded the lead, with the hare in attendance.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was occupied untangling Seamus to a large extent. After passing a few tantalizing 
openings on the shoreline, they finally came to a “B”, by an opening overlooking the hospital. Beer was found in a cooler 
and brought out to a rock in the lake.</p>

<p>A few beers later, and still no sign of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>or <font color="#FF0000">Tinker.</font> 
The BC was abandoned, and trail back was begun, looping south along the shoreline and turning back to the Benson Mt 
Trail. The trail was followed back to a check and the south branch led to the abandoned road and the site for the circle. 
The hare continued back to the cars to collect <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, 
who returned sheepishly with the hare to join the circle with a lame story of many miles of searching for trail in CT.</p>

<p>The circle was joined. Ratings were favorable based upon the loss of<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, the first swimming opportunity of the year, and the absence of GM Jake. Offsetting this, 
of course, the presence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, lack of shiggy and good weather. Overall: 6.9. Hashit: 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. How <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> avoided it, is as a result of one of those 
incomprehensible bits of legalistic hash minutiae that the RIH3 has regrettably been burdened with of late. (Your scribe 
doesn’t remember.)</p>

<p>On On On was at George’s Pizza in Pascoag. Fair pizza, foul beer and a few songs once the kiddies left. What more can 
be said? Another wasted Monday night for the RIH3.</p>
