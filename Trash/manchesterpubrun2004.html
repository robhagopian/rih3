<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Just Kevin</font>, a Hartford H3 few-time hasher, and notorious Clydesdale, has taken over some 
of the organizational reins of the 17<sup>th</sup> Annual Manchester Pub Run. This venerable event involves running a 5K 
(more or less) course through Manchester, CT while stopping at six pubs to consume a beer. Strictly speaking, this is a 
r*ce of sorts. But no one in their right mind is trying that hard anyways. And the trail is poorly marked, it never starts 
on time, there is considerable confusion on the part of the onlookers, and it is remarkably stupid. Perfect for hashers. 
Too bad there’s no shiggy in Manchester, CT.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> led a contingent of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi Boner</font> from the RIH3. <font color="#FF0000">Follow My Tits</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Kevin</font> 
represented the HardFarts. Just Matt, the eventual winner of the event, has hashed with Boston once. Three rugby players 
who ran were recruited into the circle as virgins and were made hashers.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> 
received honorary Hashit in absentia. So with this write-up, all the elements are in place to consider this an official 
hash.</p>

<p>The start was at the Manchester High School, in the back parking lot, hidden from the view of the responsible. <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Matt</font> took off, not to be seen again until he greeted all the others as they finished. Among 
the regular hashers, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> initially led, west on the Middle Turnpike to Rt 83 and the 
Main Pub. But <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Kevin </font>were on his heels and with 
years of experience at swilling beer, were back out on trail first. <font color="#FF0000">FMT </font>was not far behind, 
but <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> (without his stick and wearing SHORTS!) was pacing himself. Trail led south on 83 
with several chances to die prematurely crossing back to the east side of the road, and then crossing Rt6/44.</p>

<p>Next stop was Cheney’s, famed for the intense gaseousness of its beer. &nbsp;Actually, calling any of this stuff beer 
is an intense exaggeration. But no one said this had to be fun. Kind of like running with Boston, come to think of it. 
Next up, less than a third of a mile away was a left turn to the Oak Street Tavern. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was 
in control at this point, in a rhythm that allowed the sloshing beer in his stomach form a harmonic and to actually 
increase his speed, much like the pumping arms of the elite sprinter. He was closely pursued by <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Kevin</font> who kept up with incredible 10 second beer times in the pubs.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> 
fading fast, got lost.<font color="#FF0000"> FMT </font>was losing time by insisting on Coca-Cola in each pub because of 
her alcohol intolerance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>continued steady but watched an inning of the Red Sox game in each pub, 
drifting further to the DFL spot. The Sportsman’s Pub was next, maybe 200 yards away from Oak Street. The short distances 
worked against the runners as there was insufficient time to clear the top layer of gas from the stomach. Any belch from 
this point on meant re-swallowing six or seven ounces of warm beer, an almost certain recipe for disqualification. They 
continued south to number five, the Hungry Tiger, on Rt 534, where a group of rowdies in the outdoor seating provided 
color commentary on the runners.</p>

<p>The last leg was the longest. West on 534, back north on 83 and the east again on Oak Street. The spectators beckoning 
one back for a second visit to the Oak Street Tavern have been the undoing of more than one participant in the past. But 
the beer quality doesn’t make an extra all that tempting, so <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cruised past, ignoring an 
elderly female participant who called after him derisively: “Hey! You can’t skip one!”</p>

<p>The end of the event comes with the downing of the second beer at the Sportsman’s. <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Matt </font>had indeed finished first, and by the time <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had arrived, was well on his way 
to getting completely crocked. Luckily, he only had to drive back to Boston that evening. Finishing a solid sixth, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> felt thirsty for some beer for a change of pace, so he bought a Long Trail Ale and went outside 
to watch for the others. Just Kevin was right behind him. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>arrived and got into a 
challenge with another resulting in a chugged beer, which soon reappeared on the pavement outside. (After the finish, so 
no DQ!) <font color="#FF0000">FMT</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> came in more sedately. It was decided to 
circle up.</p>

<p>After “The Monks” was sung, the run was rated.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Kevin</font> was stuck taking times at the 
finish line, so missed his down down as “hare”. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> took responsibility and was duly 
punished. Soon three rugby players came up to ask about the songs. They were joined into the circle for as long as the 
beer remained free. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> was dementor and asked them each three questions for which no 
intelligible answers could be detected, although there was a) some self-abuse, b) some homosexuality, c) a fondness for 
sheep, and d) demonstrated a complete failure of the mathematical educational systems of this country regarding the 
determination of a square-root. They “Swang Low” and closed the circle.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> led the hash contingent back to the cars while awaiting the barbeque. <font 
color="#FF0000">Follow My Tits</font> demonstrated the rationale for her name.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, 
desperate for shiggy, scaled a fence at the high school. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> scoured the neighboring brush for some poison ivy or briars. The beer was still free so <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Matt</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Kevin</font> stayed at the bar and drank heavily. By 
the time they all got back to the Sportsman’s, the hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken were ready, and the afternoon was 
complete. An event worth any hasher’s time; hopefully we’ll be there in greater force next year.</p>
