<p><font color="#008000">Run #919</font>, November, 24, 2003<br><br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hare: </font>Dr WHO<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Nickerson Park, Attleboro, MA<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Clear, High 40's<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Async, Bondo Jovi, Fuwangi Boner, WIPOS, Oozing, SESYB, Basket Boom Boom, Jake, 
Ben, Seamus.<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Commemorating:</font> Dr WHO's Birthday<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The usual misfits gathered at Nickerson park under a sign forbidding Dogs, Alcohol, and Foul Language. For almost 15 
seconds, these rules were obeyed. <br><br>

The run was a clockwise loop, beginning with a counterclockwise and unecessary circle-jerk marked with almost invisible 
blue chalk through the neighborhood, past the satellite police station. <br><br>

From the standpipes on top of Ides Hill, the trail led back down to the park, east to some powerlines then southwest and 
uphill on the powerlines to a check (the falsie for which led to a tent containing some of the most filthy pornography the 
hare had ever encountered thus accounting for the prolonged time <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>spent on this trail), 
continuing straight to a short bushwhack and then a trail leading west over some hills finally coming out on Tiffany Road. 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket, Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>chose poorly at this check; the rest 
turned north and then east on a new powerline. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
were encouraged by the hare to take a long falsie east, but because of <font color="#FF0000">Async's</font> lumbago and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> blindness, they turned back early to rejoin the rest further north where true trail 
did in fact turn east, and north skirting the neighborhood again (whose residents were doubtless calling the Attleboro PD 
for the second time this evening) to the beer check atop a cliff. Beer was Riley's Irish Stout, and Red Hook IPA, served 
from juice jars.<br><br>

On In was straightforward, and none of the hashers noticed that the masterfully marked trail looped back over itself for 
50 yds, and then turned north back to the standpipes.<br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">Ratings:</font> 0.69 for lack of bimbos, lack of shiggy and lack of losing Basket or Bondo<br><br>
