<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Metaphysical Conversation In Cumberland Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run # 954</font>, July 24, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> Fuwangi Boner</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Mendon Road Near CVS, Northwest Cumberland</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> 70’s, Cloudy but dry</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Bondo Jovi, Dr WHO, Tinker, Visitor: Anti-Cock (HVH3), Basket Boom Boom. 
Seamus, Jake, Ben.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Encroaching on the territory of the sacred Bodhisattva, the hare from Cumberland set trail from a Physical 
Fitness Center on Mendon Road near the Woonsocket line. <font color="#FF0000">WHO, Tinker</font>and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had a beer while waiting. A visitor from Happy Valley, <font color="#FF0000">
Anti-Cock</font> joined the group. [His decision to hash with the RIH3 was obviously the result of a peculiar 
derangement occurring after eating too many “mushrooms” at a lesbian faculty party at one of the Seven Sisters. But 
I digress.] <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>ruined the evening again. He arrived. The Fitness Center was busy. 
The group watched as a series of cars and SUVs pulled up near the hashers. Girls in tight athletic outfits would get 
out, and glance over at them in curiosity. But the hash’s hopes for some metaphysical conversations were dashed again 
and again as the girls turned away (usually with a little snigger) and went inside. When it became clear that no one 
else was stupid enough to join the group, they were off on a trail at the back of the parking lot.</p>

<p>Trail led north, then generally northwest.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO </font>took an early lead, only to find a long 
metaphysical check-back that regrouped the hashers. The trails were overgrown and dry. Flour marks led to frequent 
annoying zig-zags. But there was no real shiggy. Before long, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>as usual struck out 
on his own, heading west. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>was given inside info by hare, and therefore became twice 
as lost. More metaphysical conversation. His artificial hips lead to the tendency to walk in clockwise circles, while
<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> loss of sight in one eye forces him to walk in counter-clockwise circles. Thus the 
two met, ultimately joining forces to try and find trail. [The sight of these two wandering aimlessly through the woods 
led by the long-suffering Seamus, would bring pity even to the heart of the most ruthless Iraqi terrorist or Nazi War 
criminal. But I digress.]</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was first out of the woods, on trail on Highland Corporate Dr. However, he was 
stymied by a check and wandered southeast on some powerlines, holding a metaphysical conversation with himself. [This 
only took a minute or two. It was a small conversation. Not much meat to it. But I digress.] <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">AC</font> emerged, and with hints from the hare, trail was found on the powerline 
heading northwest. It was straightforward from this point, and as they ran along, in the distance they could just hear
<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> horn as he and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>went further and further into 
Woonsocket. Trail was led by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>. They turned northeast on the powerlines at the branch 
point, and crossing back over the far side of the Highland Industrial Park loop, they found the beer check by a overflow 
holding pond.</p>

<p>The beer was opened. They sat on the concrete access shaft for the pump station, and talked while occasionally 
whistling to see if the lost elders could be brought back to the fold. Sure enough, with the beer almost finished, 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>showed up, with the usual dramatic tales 
of virgin trail, missed opportunities, and fine hashmanship on the part of <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font> 
No one was listening. They were figuratively being subjected to more metaphysical conversation. The dogs decided to swim 
in the distinctly stagnant and noisome waters of the holding pond. They then thoughtfully climbed the embankment up to 
the hashers to shake off. This was sufficient excuse to call it quits and hit the trail back.</p>

<p>Marks were found leading southwest on the loop road, and then cutting through the woods south of CVS. They were 
all together briefly. But at the check on Highland Corporate Dr, <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Bondo</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>decided to retrace the marks through the woods, while <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">AC</font>, led by the hare, made the mistake of taking the true trail. Yet 
another metaphysical conversation! This was several miles of pavement: down the loop road, then left on Mendon back to 
the start. Footsore, coughing from the traffic fumes, and dripping from the heat, they limped into the parking lot to 
see <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>resting easily in the cool shade 
by the cars. Wonderful!</p>

<p>They circled up behind the fitness center. Marks were poor and the hare couldn’t even get much mileage out of 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> loss as he still made the beer check. Lousy weather, no shiggy, no bimbos from 
the fitness center, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> AND <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> at the BC: total 
score was -69! Hashit went to the hare for non-trail related crimes against nature and humanity, along with excessive 
metaphysical conversations with <font color="#FF0000">Granola Balls</font> of the NH3!</p>

<p>On On On was at Tucks, and the visitor, fully recovered from psilocybin toxicity, wisely begged off. The group was 
well-behaved, although the discussion became quite heated with <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>stirring up a 
political debate beginning with the upcoming Presidential election and ultimately leading to questions of the existence 
of God and the reality of Natural Law. The evening thus was ended with a final metaphysical conversation.</p>
