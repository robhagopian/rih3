<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF">The Run:
</font><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
<br>
First, your scribe must point out that the hare's d'erections to the start of
the run have again raised our level of incompetence to almost superhuman
heights, setting the standard to which we all must ultimately be held. In spite
of this and because of the well-known locale, <font color="#FF0000">Just Susan,
Dr WHO, WIPOS, Shine On</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> arrived
before the strict 6:30 deadline noted by the hare. Of course Diamond Hill,
described as virgin territory by the hare, is about as virginal as the average
104 year old sailor so it wasn't that hard to find. It did provide a bit of a
poser for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font>, who circled between Mt. St. Rita Convent and Mercymount School
looking for virgins (and flour) before the location of the true start occurred
to them. <font color="#FF0000">Just Susan</font>, in an effort to gain an unfair
advantage on trail by poisoning the pack, provided a six pack of Carling Black
Label: an unusual brew obviously mislabelled as beer by a ruthless and amoral
manufacturer. But the stomachs of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and<font color="#FF0000">
Dr WHO </font>were more than a match for the dreaded Black Death; in fact they
were pleasantly surprised to find that the mixture successfully killed off their
tapeworms, as well as several other intestinal parasites. The hare committed the
unspeakable crime of passing the deadly mixture on to the GM after enjoying a
few sips himself.<br>
<br>
As 6:30 arrived, the rain which had been light began to come down in earnest and
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, fearing that he might catch a wee sniffle,
broke out a second water-proof layer, and spot-welded the seams before setting
out on trail. <font color="#FF0000">Just Susan</font>, under an oversized
umbrella, asked if the hash truly intended to go out in the rain and thunder.
Reassured that this was indeed the preferred weather of the RIH3, she lent the
bumbershoot to the hare (who used the blunt end in deviant ways while awaiting
the pack at the beer check), and the pack was off. Arrows led northwards, and
then turning right to the base of the ski slope, no further evidence of trail
was seen except for a flour tinged rivulet coming down from the awesome peak.
Using crampons and a modified chimney traverse, the 481 foot crag was attacked
by the valiant hashers to find still no evidence that the hare had ever made the
summit. The body of Archibald Mallory (George's brother) was found
half-concealed in the permafrost of the&nbsp;South Col glacier, but left
reverently intact. Southeast along the ridge, crossing the 42nd parallel a lone
checkmark was finally encountered. This was followed to a second most obviously
placed check, downhill and visible from the first. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>
felt that the hare could not have been so stupid, and that the group was
probably following the trail backwards. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font>, having long experience with the hare's level of intelligence, knew
better and continued on trail, picking out the partially washed-out paste of
flour from the white quartz with ease.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font> crossing back over 114 after a brief but ill-advised sojourn at
Catamint (or was it Catamite) Hill, made several rotations around the hare's
circle-jerk which the rest of the pack had missed. <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font>, tiring of this, followed the obvious ridge and joined the rest of
the mountaineers who had followed trail, conch horn sounds and unusual odors to
the hare and the beer check. This was on a cliff, 150 feet above 114, qualifying
it as highest beer check of the millennium. Brown Ale and Shandy were enjoyed,
the rain stopped, a beautiful sunset and breathtaking rainbow were marveled at,
and all was for the best in this best of all possible hashing worlds. But, like
a booger in the scorpion bowl, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived
dripping on to the otherwise perfect scene.<br>
<br>
The hare said: &quot;Of all the beer checks, and all the hashes in the world,
and he walks into mine!&quot; Yes, after weeks of missing beer check after beer
check, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>finally made one. There was a
palpable change in the tone of the evening as he proceeded to show his delight
by mooning Cumberland, insulting the pack, and attempting to convince <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
to hang-glide off the cliff using his legionnaire's cap. A few songs, a quick
game of shandy football with the dogs made <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and<font color="#FF0000"> Dr. WHO</font> give up and head off down the trail
north along Sylvy's Brook to the cars, followed by the rest of the pack. A brief
trip back up the mountain by the confused <font color="#FF0000">Slasher</font>
resulted in a few scrapes and a fractured patella, but otherwise the run ended
without incident. The hare had no beer and ran home to start cooking with his
tail between his legs (about the only thing visible in that location without
significant magnification, by the way). <font color="#FF0000">Just Susan</font>
had run out of diabetic horse urine, but she came up&nbsp;with a six pack of
Irish Ale to soften the fact that she was already showing annoying signs of
responsibility by skipping the on-on-on to care for her children.<br>
<br>
A convoy to Woonsocket was next, and at chez <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
the circle was held in the garage, knee deep in filth and detritus specially
prepared by the hare to discourage a long ceremony. The run was rated by
opposites: the ideal weather was balanced by the lack of shiggy, the presence of
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was balanced by the presence of two females
(a record for 2001), the shortness of the run was balanced by the gain in
elevation, etc. Total score: 0. Hashit was presented by the Baxter sniff test:
the hare had left the circle in a cowardly fashion to burn the chicken, but he
could not fool Baxter who strained at his traces to nominate the hare. After
swinging low, the wet and malodorous bunch went upstairs to befoul the
furniture, swill the beer and ravage the hounds. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>,
feeling that not enough damage had been done this evening, set himself up in the
hot tub, using 7 times the recommended amount of Kermit the Frog Bubble bath. He
was not seen again, although many of the group noted a suspicious looking
formless cloud of foam which now and then materialized to steal more chicken and
corn. Compared to a naked <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, the improvement
was immeasurable. <font color="#FF0000">Just Big Sh*t</font> arrived, and took
the scene in stride, pretending not to notice the destruction and carnage around
her. As always, a good time was had by all.<br>
<br>
<br>
On on<br>
