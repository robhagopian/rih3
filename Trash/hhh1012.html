<p><font color="#008000">Run #1012</font>, August 22, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Slatersville Reservoir, Burrillville.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 80’s, Clear.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Dry Foot Fairy, Sparky the Hobosexual (Newport H3), Dr WHO, Oozing 
SD, Amish It Head, Gives Great Head, Fuwangi Boner, WIPOS, Tinker, Pounder On It, Dogmeat, Seamus.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>For reasons [Actually, the word “reason” is basically incompatible with “<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>”. He’s an 
oxymoron, after all. But I digress. Already!] known only to the hare, the run this evening was to have a Scottish theme. 
This meant that: a) the hare would bring single malt to the start in an attempt to mask the pathetic nature of the run, b) 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, freshly returned from Scotland would bring something stupid that he acquired 
overseas, like a Scottish Flag or something equally pathetic, c) <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> would exercise his 
pathetic Scottish accent, and d) that <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> would wear a kilt as yet another excuse to 
flash his pathetic genitals at everyone. Unfortunately, all this came to pass.</p>

<p>The hare further demonstrated his laziness by live-setting the first half, and having <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat
</font> accompany him to the start to act as “Bag Lady”, excuse me, “Bag Car”. He promised a swim. He promised 
Scottish-themed flotation devices for the non-swimmers. [At this point, a reasonably astute hasher would have got back 
into his or her car and driven straight to the hare’s house. Where there would inevitably be a keg! But again, 
“reasonably” and “astute” are words rarely applied to hashers. At least in a positive sense.]  With sinking hearts, they 
allowed the hare a generous head start. No one wanted to risk snaring him. If caught, he would all-too willingly forfeit 
his pants. They knew he would be naked soon enough. Most dreaded this. (And yet they showed up in the first place. Hmmn!)
</p>

<p>Trail was started at 6:40, then. They crossed the street and went up the embankment for a small circle jerk around the 
retention pond, and avoiding the obvious powerlines. Soon, they bushwhacked briefly and caught trail heading southwest 
across Inman road into Wright’s Chicken Farm. They crossed the parking lot mostly together, and turned west on Rt 102. 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> led, with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, who never left the road, catching up 
quickly. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> took advantage of this moment to disappear. They all should have followed 
suit.</p>

<p>The trail crossed 102 before coming to Rt 7, and joined up with the overgrown railroad grade heading southwest. The 
group soon turned south to the Victory Highway, and reversed direction, heading east. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> 
appeared from the woods. Big mistake. Trail crossed down to the Branch River just before the Old Nasonville Road. <font 
color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> looked doubtfully at the river. But the hare was 
sighted, just making the crossing ahead of the pack. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> led. He ignored the inflated 
turtles, rings etc. left by the hare. He plunged in and swam across. The rest followed and discovered that the bottom of 
the river was a mucky mess of rotting vegetation which, when disturbed, released some particularly foul gasses. By the 
third or fourth swimmer, the water resembled a particularly active sewer emptying the dysentery ward of a Cholera Hospital 
in India. A fine moment!</p>

<p>Trail then led to a second river, with an arrow pointing across. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> thought he could see 
a mark on the far side. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">GGH</font> were too smart for 
this. <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> and <font color="#FF0000">DFF</font> were not. <font color="#FF0000">Sparky
</font> found the second river even more flatulent than the first. Excellent! True trail led around through a clearing 
filled with garbage, following a semicircle on a ridge overlooking yet another swampy curve in the river. The confusion 
around these markings, laid by an obviously panicked hare, allowed the second-time swimmers to rejoin the main group. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> found trail down to a dirt road, and southwest out to Rt 7.</p>

<p>A check on the road sent half northwards, to the Western Inn. It was closed. They returned south to find true trail and 
the BC at some powerlines on the west side of the road. The hare was waiting, but wouldn’t reveal the beer. It was 
nevertheless found and opened. As they drank, <font color="#FF0000">Pounder</font> appeared, suspiciously dry. Then <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> showed up, also dry. The group was almost complete. Only <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> 
was missing. Only <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> was concerned about this. It was explained that the hash has been 
running under Darwinian principles for some time. But somehow, winnowing out the weak just doesn’t seem to be working out 
for us. Perhaps the laws of Natural Selection need to be revised.</p>

<p>After a decent interval and a few songs, they moved on. Trail now led southwest on the powerlines, briefly. A check 
sent <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> to the left, correct for once. Familiar territory was entered, and the approach to 
Snake hill Road was sensed. It was getting dark. Only <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> had a light. Doesn’t he know that 
among the <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> technology is forbidden? At any rate, the trail zigzagged southwest across a 
ridge and descended down to <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font>. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led the pack. He 
arrived triumphant. He was greeted by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>. Aghast, he tried to run back. But the beer was enough to keep him there. The rest arrived.
</p>

<p>The Circle was held in the pool, with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> opting for the au naturel mode. <font color="#FF0000">Pounder</font> noted that the 
cold water was having quite an effect. She was assured that there would be little improvement in the shrinkage, even in a 
hot tub. Ratings for the run were prolonged, mostly irrelevant and occasionally unintelligible. But the loss of <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, the fine stream crossings, and the good beer made up in part for the sight of <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> naked (or in a kilt, for that matter) and the hare 
was awarded a <b>+0.69</b>. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> received the hashit. No surprises. No reasons. None 
required.</p>

<p>After swinging low, they came out to a fine meal courtesy of Dogmeat. They tried some single malts. They had some more 
beer. And how could you end such a fine evening? Why, by introducing <font color="#FF0000">Pounder</font> to the fine and 
rare cinematic experience of “Lulu’s Talking Asshole”, of course. She was duly impressed. (Unlike her reaction to her 
earlier experiences in the pool.) This masterpiece was also well-received by <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">GGH</font>. Perhaps it’s time to begin the RIH3 Film Festival. Maybe that’ll get us some more new blood.
