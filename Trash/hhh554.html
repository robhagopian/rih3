<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Emerald Square in the northern part of Rhode Island
was the start of what was to be </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket BB’s</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
500th run, attendance was the best this year with twelve idiots plus two
late comers, which were </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket BB, Async,
Bondo, Jake, Little Neck, Plume, Sajid, Rusty, Krisco Kid, SEO, Ate Balls</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and yours truly </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Snot</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
plus our latecomers </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Piece of Tail </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Horny Stump</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
An expectant crowd were not to be disappointed, only by the fact that </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">wanted the whole of the square to know it
was his 500th by trying to erect a sign using a handkerchief two bits of
string and some matchsticks, this reminded me of Blue Peter. (only the
British contingent will understand this) Consequently the run was delayed
15 minutes whilst </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">amused
himself as nobody else was interested, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">at this point made a couple of calls on the
old cellphone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> thinking this
was a Newport run marked the start in the wrong direction and wrote the
wrong time we really must get you a minute hand for your Mickey Mouse watch
one day, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
then proceeded to blow his whistle, I don’t know how he gets his head down
that far, but the pack was off looking for red chalk which only the hare
could see, with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">already
lost carving his own trail the hare gave us all some help at the first
few checks not wishing to piss off or lose such a good turnout as the best
or worst was yet to come. It was not long before we settled down to a track
running along side one assumes was the 295 with water on the left and snow
underfoot. It was not long before the pack came across the first circle
jerk which took the less intelligent ones through briar, the brighter sparks
which included the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Plume, Ate Balls</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and myself doubled back to the hares horny sound, the now familiar wet
fart of a bugle. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Another couple of miles of twists and turns until
we came across the first stop, hot chocolate with butterscotch schnapps
to warm our cockles in the 20 degree F conditions, at least it made up
for the cider on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Baskets </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">previous
run. On out was a loop back onto a road past some gobsmacked plods (police)
in wheels through a pit area where </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">found
out he still can’t play Batmans sidekick as he was unable to fly over a
steep 20 ft drop, instead landing on a thin layer of snow finishing up
sitting on his brain, fortunately he was not hurt, but he is of Irish descent,
that is no sense no feeling! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The second stop which this time had beer was taken
behind a large rock away from the prying eyes of plod and if </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Horny
Stump</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> had not been busy poking </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Piece
of Tail</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> he might of heard us. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s
portable vibrator again went off and he quickly put it into his shorts,
not to deaden the sound but to feel the full benefit of the AT&amp;T buzz.
On off and with no shiggy the previous two weeks expectation was high and
we were not to be disappointed, however after running for over two hours
a battery stop would have been useful as flashlights were getting low all
round, with ice cold shiggy the only way home, cold it was with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
laughing all the way-you bastard. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The pack truly stretched out all we had was the
sound of that bloody bugle to follow which a lot of us wanted to insert
further up! Eventually Emerald Square lights in view we worked our way
back to the cars the last hurdle being a fence. I followed </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> through
a small hole in the fence the only problem being my well built body got
wedged in, finally releasing myself with a quick fart, I removed the Hashshit
and tried again with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
pissing himself offering no help at all, just remember </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Snot</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> will have
his revenge. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Eventually all returned to meet our latecomers
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Horny stump </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Piece of Tail </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">who
had been very close to catching the pack-tough luck try again next week,
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">again on
his bloody cellphone directing incision guides for his patients circumcision
which apparently went wrong, the poor chap will be surprised to see he
will need hormone tablets to grow tits to match his lower half. Circle
up continued even though </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was on line as this was true brass monkey weather. Usual ceremonies performed
with the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Plume</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
doing a fine job on his down down to make up for the dreadful mistake of
referring to us in his article as the Harriets. Marks for the run came
out at just above average for this year at 1.3 the high mark being given
for variety of terrain in difficult conditions, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
had a special down down to commemorate his 500th run-where were the T-shirts!
Eventually </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s
battery run out and he was duly awarded the Hashshit<IMG SRC="kilroy.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT>,
for such a serious offense, I feel a handle coming on “Dick to Phone” I
use my finger personally. Actually </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">invented
the tin cans and string communication when he was a boy and never got out
of the habit of stringing people along. The on-on was at an establishment
in the Attleboro area where </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">had
a huge champagne bottle to celebrate his achievement. Do it yourself sarnies
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Krisco Kid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
thought it was going to be the last time he ate, the only thing restricting
any more food going in between the bread was the floor and the ceiling!
Another memorable evening at the Rhode Island Hash.</FONT></P>
