<p><font color="#008000">Run #1014</font>, September 5, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Bonoer</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Diamond Hill and Arnold’s Mill Reservoirs, Cumberland.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 70’s, less humid, clear.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy, Async, Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Amish It Head, Oozing SD, 
SESYB, Just Dima (a little Fairy), Seamus. Visitors: Friar F*ck (BH3), Follow My Tits (Hartford H3), 
Gee-Your-Dick-Smells-Terrific (SFH3). Virgin: Just Kari.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hare was determined to get revenge. He was smarting from numerous insults and slights (imaginary, pecuniary, 
urinary and otherwise) inflicted upon him by the hash. He had tried for revenge before. But, it had failed. They were all 
let off with a warning. (See <a href="hhh967.html">Run #967</a>.) So this time, he planned more carefully. A broad 
daylight assault upon the water supply of Pawtucket, during a period of high terrorist alert. There was no way that 
someone wouldn’t get arrested this day, he reasoned. Fortunately for the hash, this hare always gets in trouble when he 
tries to reason.</p>

<p>An early start time for Labor Day ensured a good turn out. Visitors showed up. A virgin magically appeared. <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> brought his kid, <font color="#FF0000">Just Dima</font>. There was lawn bowling. There 
were Frisbees. A few beers were opened. It was all very festive. The hashers were laughing and frolicking. If only it 
could have ended right there! But it was soon 2 PM. The run started.</p>

<p>They were directed out Wollen Drive, and turned left. [Hey, what do you think? Shouldn’t it be Swollen Drive? Did they 
lose the S? I bet <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> stole it! But I digress.] Trail was on Nate Whipple briefly, but 
soon turned right, into the Water Board Property off Sneech Pond Rd just before “Pentimento”, an antique shop. The pack 
followed marks through the woods northeast to the lower spillway access road. Most continued east out to North Attleboro 
Road. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
continued through the woods, and paralleled the road into Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The pack on trail, led by <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Gee-Your-Dick</font>, and newcomer 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Kari</font>, had faithfully followed trail. They were shepherded by the hare, who was looking 
back anxiously hoping that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> would not find his 
stingy marks. They mastered some checks in a pine grove and turned back west into RI.</p>

<p>In the rear for once, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was delayed on a falsie. But he soon found true trail and 
thanks to his unfortunate lateness, he met up with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> as they came out on the road. He cursed under his breath. He joined up with 
the DFLs as they continued northeast on N. Attleboro Rd. A mark was seen, heading west. They quickly turned back into the 
woods and heard the pack ahead.</p>

<p>This was not exactly virgin territory. Each of the hashers in the rearguard had an idea of where trail would lead. 
They all independently decided to head for the spillway between the reservoirs. (See the pictures from <a 
href="hhh898.html">Run #898</a> for happier days!) <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, having actually set trail here, had 
the best idea of which way to go. So he split off from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB
</font> and made straight for the spillway. There were no marks. This guaranteed he was right.</p>

<p>In the lead pack, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led the others on trail. This was a half circle dipping south to 
the shoreline and then turning back up hill to a short bushwhack. He could hear <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> 
whistle ahead, and arrived to find <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> stumbling around in the spillway, looking for a “B”, 
some beer, or at least some shiggy. They were both disappointed. As was <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, trying his 
own route down along the shoreline. <font color="#FF0000">Just Kari</font> was impressed by their incompetence. <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> finally climbed out on the road. He found marks leading north on Reservoir Rd. He could just 
make out two figures far off in the shallows of Diamond Hill Reservoir. It was <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Dima</font>! <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot’s</font> car was parked just west of the spillway. 
Auto hashers! But they were in shiggy!</p>

<p>Out of the spillway the group climbed. They ran up Reservoir Road north to a mark by the road. This mark was right 
next to a “No Trespassing: Pawtucket Water Board, Violators subject to $1000 Fine and/or Imprisonment” sign. But hashers 
in the RIH3 stop reading after “No Trespassing…”. They get bored. They are impatient. Reading is hard. [Note: the word 
‘trespass’ derives from the French: ‘tres’=three, or too much and ‘pass’=to cross, or break wind. Since no one, except 
perhaps <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, ever passes through an area three times on a run while breaking wind, the 
hash is never in technical violation of these laws and can feel free to proceed. I think. Therefore, I digress.] More 
importantly, they saw a poorly-concealed cooler. At last! Beer! The cooler was seized and brought down through the woods 
to the shore. They waded with their precious burden through shallows and mud to a small islet 20 feet offshore.</p>

<p>The beer was opened. The group stood drinking. They were standing in a protected reservoir in full view of the pumping 
station. As well as the busy road. Brilliant! The hare’s plans were coming to fruition, or so he hoped. He hung back, 
ostensibly waiting for <font color="#FF0000">FMT</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Friar</font>. Right! Finally, the call 
of the beer proved too much. No one was getting arrested. He joined the group on the rock, kicked aside some goose turds 
and started some songs.</p>

<p>Just as they were finishing up, a truck with a flasher pulled up and slowed as he saw <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot’s
</font> Car. He placed a warning sign on its windshield. He turned around. He finally saw the nine adults, one child and 
one large dog standing in the water. Having noticed him themselves, the group quickly packed out and headed for the road. 
Expecting arrest, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> jogged along towards the official. They received a dirty look. The truck continued down to the rest. They got a 
nasty glare. And that’s it! <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi’s</font> plans went down in flames. Pathetic! Your taxpayer’s 
dollar at work!</p>

<p>Trail now was on pavement. They turned west on Reservoir Road. A check just past Wisteria Lane had some looking for 
desperate housewives. Others looked for trail. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Gee-Your-Dick\
</font> south into Diamond Hill Cemetery. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> led the others north on trail in the Jason’s 
Grant development. They quickly turned into the woods and continued north towards the old ski slopes of Diamond Hill. 
<font color="#FF0000">GYDST</font> [Now, don’t you think someone would have re-named him: Gee-Your-Prick-Smells-Yummy. 
GYPSY. Get it? Must be because of the competitive hash in SF. Or maybe, I got his name wrong. But I digress!] left <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and cut through some private backyards out to Nate Whipple. [There seems to be no respect 
for private property in California. Not like RI! Oh, well. I’m digressing again.] <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
followed familiar trails southeast through the cemetery, crossing the standing pipes (showing the exceptional bravery and 
athletic prowess that we all have always associated with him. What a hasher!) and meandering through the cool pine groves 
out to the Park Cemetery and the Fire Station.</p>

<p>The main pack crossed into Diamond Hill. What debaucheries occurred, your scribe dare not describe. [Note: Your scribe 
in fact does ‘describe’. From the French: ‘de’=not and ‘scribe’=write-up. And while we’re on this, for <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> sake: ‘digress’, from the Greek: ‘di’=two and ‘gress’=to break wind. I knew he was 
curious.] But <font color="#FF0000">Just Kari</font> may never be the same. At any rate, they waited for a while by the 
hare’s truck. They suddenly realized <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> they were waiting for. Off they drove, back to the 
hare’s home. They found <font color="#FF0000">FMT</font> and <font color="#FF0000">GYDST</font> playing Bocce, with 
<font color="#FF0000">Dima</font> at high risk. <font color="#FF0000">Friar</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot
</font> were drinking beer. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was trying to find the “On-In” trail in the swamps at the 
end of Wollen (Swollen) Dr. They began the circle.</p>

<p>Ratings for the run: minimal shiggy, reused territory, pathetic weather, dry spillways, and no arrests were cited. 
But, in favor of the run: bimbos, multiple losses on trail, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, wet BC, etc. Final 
total: <b>+0.69</b>. Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Maybe. But if not, he should have got it. The visitor 
was welcomed, the virgin interrogated, and they Swang Low. <b><i>[Warning: Long Sentence ahead!]</i></b> Food was 
provided by all, and they ate, drank, sang and behaved like idiots (all except <font color="#FF0000">Just Dima</font>, 
who was above all this childishness) with heavy lawn bowling balls, and large, strangely-shaped, copper lawn sprinklers 
as the day wore on, the yard furniture was fractured and the spouses at home grew almost as annoyed as the hare’s 
parents, who had been forced by circumstance, by an act of foolish passion years ago, against all reason, defying all 
the dictates of common sense, to stay here and put up with their prodigal son the hare, selflessly and charitably, 
ignoring both him and his rude companions late into the afternoon. Oh, pity them!</p>
