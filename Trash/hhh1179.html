far enough south to virtually guarantee the absence of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, the Woonsocket girls and any visitors from Boston. 
This is a good thing. And the gas prices were coming close to an all time low. 
But then again, <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> was hare, so all bets were off. 
It was a small, all-male group that gathered in a small parking area just south 
of Buckley Oil on Rt 108 in South Kingston. The police cruisers showed some 
interest. But not enough to stop the whole thing. Too bad! At 6:30, fearing that 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> might go against form and show up, they were 
off, casting nervous glances backwards over their shoulders.<?xml:namespace

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail ignored 
the obvious in-trail on the north side of the Rocky Brook Reservoir. Instead, it 
followed the banks of the pond south and turned west on Dam Road. A check sent 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> along 
the road. <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> turned right and found true trail 
entering the woods. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> after some brief indecision followed. Trail was a 
winding nature path, heading north. There were many convenient bridges and 
boardwalks over the shiggy. Boring. Eventually they came upon Asa 
Pond.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> was mightily confused. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT>, not confused at all, took a long falsie along the dam east. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and the hare caught up. The hare gave hints, and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>now led out to the bike path. Trail turned 
northwest on the bike path, crossed Asa Pond Road. A missing mark was replaced 
by the hare which turned them left, up an embankment to a ridge. The trail 
turned south.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

color=#ff0000>Oozing </FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> now led as 
they came to an open industrial area, and followed a fence. A maze of dirt bike 
paths, discarded PVC pipes and numerous identical appearing clearings were 
encountered. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> came down to the Peacedale Reservoir. No 
Marks.<FONT color=#ff0000> Oozing</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> 
shared some special time in the woods further east. Finally <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> came upon the hare, smirking in one of those 
identical clearings. The beer stop! Unmarked, of course. But there were no <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> beer hiding games this night. As the rest gradually 
arrived, the beer was out and flowing.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">No one was there 
to impress, so singing was limited. The hare indicated the way out, east along 
the Peacedale Reservoir dam towards Sandy Bottom Shores Dr (sounds 
uncomfortable, doesn’t it?). A car was idling, then driving back and forth. But 
no, it wasn’t the cops. Damn! At any rate, trail re-entered the woods north, 
back to the bike path. The in-trail was found and followed in reverse to Asa 
Pond. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> decided to follow <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls’</FONT> falsie back to the road, and, with a brief bushwhack, they came 
out at Buckley Oil. They turned back to the cars. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> found their 
own way back. More special time, no doubt. Only the hare stuck to his guns and 
followed actual trail. They circled.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Ratings: virgin 
territory, only moderate pavement, and mass confusion near the beer check were 
good, and lack of <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> sealed the deal. Total:+6.9! 
Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> for no good reason. But there's 
never a bad reason to give hashit to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>.&nbsp;And 
it was getting cold. Finishing up, they moved to The Pumphouse Tavern, a half 
block away. They were very well-behaved. But there were no hot chicks in the 
place, so why make a fuss?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
