at the same point as a previous Robby Burns Highland Hash in January, almost
tracking the same route, at the beginning at least at this North Smithfield
location. </FONT></P>

run, being wet, long and containing very few checks. Before long I was
following up the rear which is my normal position, with the exception of
the lone Boston Hasher-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine On</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
Being the perfect British Gent waiting and shouting on-on for this lone
Bimbo, which is one thing I will never do again. For the reason that we
shortly came across shiggy upon I very soon found myself up to my thighs
in shit and completely stuck. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine On</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
using my head as a stepping stone carried on, suggesting I should get out
before dark! After finally digging my way out and retrieving my trusty
running shoes from a premature burial, I carried on only to get that sinking
feeling again. At this point </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">was
not on my Christmas card list and after another strenuous removal I continued
on. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">By now my adventure had cost me the best part
of five minutes and after taking another minor detour I found trail and
eventually caught up with the hare, who suggested I was a touch slow, totally
unaware I had almost drowned in a bog. Eventually my pace caught up with
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine On</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> and
the old bastard-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
who led us down a so called short cut, where we got cut to ribbons in the
thorns, but eventually ended up by a reservoir supping beer before the
other poor bastards were anywhere near, due of course to the lack of flour.
Eventually </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
came in from one side of the reservoir and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">coming
in from the other side. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Jake</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
however decided to swim up through the middle of the reservoir. The Hare
gave all sorts of lame excuses why there were two trails, fortunately for
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> the Beer
was OK other wise he might have been drowned. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As darkness was falling the on in was re-routed
mainly on tarmac which had few marks but led us back to the start. Poor
old Jake was throwing up left, right and center, probably from something
he had drunk from the reservoir, but this expression summed up the run.
Don’t feel bad Jake we all agree with you. The On-On was at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s
abode where </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
did a fine job of cooking for the evening. The circle up gave the run a
mediocre rating of 1.3 x 10 to the minus 96, the saving grace being the
grub and grog. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
again was the recipient of the coveted Hashshit award which as always was
well deserved for his whining. A long run where more flour would have been
useful never the less this run had everything including a near drowning.
