<p>From the Hareline:</p>

<p><i>IMPORTANT: After setting trail today, the mystery co-hare and I marveled at the beauty and brilliance of what is 
sure to be hash of the decade. Nevertheless, and going against my better judgement (which is why I'm saying this), there 
are a few things you should know for this hash, especially the newer folks. Wear warm socks, like the triggered by water 
thermo-nuclear type. Also, if you've got gaiters (not gators), then wear them. Heck, if you've got gators, bring them too. 
Otherwise, prepare yourself for an experience you will never forget and rave about for years!</i></p>

<p>The hare set the scene for this trail with the above false advertising. Even with this carnival-like shill, reasonable 
numbers of experienced hashers made an appearance. But experience in a RIH3 hasher correlates inversely with their 
intelligence. The more you show up, the stupider you become. Just read the list and the proof is self-evident. Only 
<font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> had no excuse. But the hare promised an event to celebrate the birthdays of both 
Rita Hayworth AND Evel Kneivel. The thought of doing motorcycle jumps in a low-cut satin evening gown was too much 
temptation for her. If she only had known! And the hare had co-opted <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> from Newport, as 
co-hare! Could things be worse?</p>

<p>The hash started promptly. In spite of himself, the hare had one brilliant innovation in mind. They left some glowering 
parents and dog-walkers at the school, and ran across the street. They turned north on the powerlines. They came to a BC! 
Fantastic! It was almost too good to be true! Less than a hundred yards, and a Beer Check! This could revolutionize 
hashing as we know it! He claimed it as a substitute for a prelube, but clearly, this is the wave of the future. Some 
thought that the beer choices were somewhat suspect. This is simply jealous carping. Beer was enjoyed. Several beers, for 
some. And to top it off, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> arrived late, and missed it altogether. <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> wasn’t even in West Warwick, yet. Wow!</p>

<p>True trail was reluctantly started. They crossed back and turned south on the powerlines, led by <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> (who had only managed to drink one beer. Wimp!). All of a sudden <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> burst through some poison ivy, like a sudden expulsion of pus from a giant, ripe boil on 
the buttocks. He caught up with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> as they continued straight down hill with checks only 
alternating between the three routes along the powerlines. There was occasional mud. But nothing else of note until a 
check led to a falsie straight. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> obliterated the false mark. He hid in the bushes. Ha, 
Ha! This fooled no one. At least for half an hour. That was when <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> had arrived, got lost, 
got disgusted with himself and went home for a beer. Ha, Ha! He left a note on the car of the hare:</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1020/1.jpg"><br><br>His trailcraft is only equaled by his grammar!</p></center>

<p>Back up at the last check <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> were on track and 
turned right. The trail briefly bushwhacked south on the west side of the powerlines, and then turned in. Again the hare, 
desperate to make the trail interesting, set checks. But almost all led straight. Only the co-hare was fooled. And with 
impenetrable brush up hill to the north, and the north branch of the Pawtuxet River to the south, it didn’t take a genius 
to find the trail. Luckily for this crew! <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
still managed to get in the lead. What do you think happened next? They called back, pretending they were on a falsie! Ha, 
Ha! Only the co-hare was fooled.</p>

<p>They trail was partly path, but mostly deer tracks. The recent rains favored the hare, and there were several active 
streams of run-off to cross. The trail led through a few brambles. There were some fallen trees to negotiate. There was 
even a nice knee-deep pool, camouflaged by a carpet of floating fall foliage. It wasn’t on trail. So it caught <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> nicely. Ha, Ha! But it still didn’t come close to living up to the hareline disclaimer. Even 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> couldn’t get much blood out of his legs! Only the co-hare was impressed.</p>

<p>Finally, they came to a path next to the river. This led west. And soon, a second “B” was encountered. The second beer 
check was a great improvement. Juice Jars containing beer! 60 Minute IPA! Chicory Stout! <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
made a brief attempt at hiding the beer from late arrivals <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>! Ha, Ha! No <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>! WOW! It could have been the BC of the 
century. Songs were started, beer was enjoyed. But, a mysterious light appeared across the river. It went back and forth 
along an apparent path on the opposite bank for several minutes. The hashers called out. They prayed that it was the 
police. “Arrest us, Officers!” they pleaded. But their worst fears were confirmed. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
crossed the river and joined them.</p>

<p>While <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had a beer, and tried (unsuccessfully) to come up with a Rhubarb song that 
hadn’t already been used, the hare and co-hare conferred. The trail had been set while the river was much higher. They had 
not thought to cross the river at this point. So, it was decided that the hare would cross and live set the rest. So he 
was given 10 minutes. He told them to leave the remaining beer there, and he would pick it up in the morning. But like the 
Navy SEALS, the group was not about to leave one of their own (beers) behind. Led by <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, and carrying the precious cargo they crossed the waist deep flood.</p>

<p>On the south side of the river now, there was no confusion. The hare’s light had been clearly seen setting a west-bound 
falsie and doubling back. Only the co-hare was fooled by the first check. The rest turned southeast. Trail was a 
well-defined path, with a few puddles. It was a tough, grueling, pitiless 250 yards. Ha, Ha! And then, they came to the 
third BC! The thirsts needed quenching! Again, a great moment, with picnic tables, additional juice (beer) jars, pickled 
onions, Chex mix, and only the fact that no one had got lost casting a minor pall on the event.</p>

<p>The circle was formed. Ratings for the run: by now most were feeling their oats (or barley, as the case may be) and 
were inclined to bee charitable. So: no pavement, three beer checks, river and swamp crossings, quality bimbos, and a few 
(self-inflicted) scratches on the shins of the co-hare and the total was: <b>69</b>! Hashit caused some competition in 
its awarding. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> must have learned a new song or something, as he kept volunteering. Or 
perhaps it was the beer. Therefore, it was given to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>! Ha, Ha! They finished up the 
beer, the Chex, the onions and the ceremony simultaneously.</p>

<p>The hare directed the group out, east in a semicircle that eventually came out in River Point Park. Skirting the 
fields, they came to Hay St, and the bicycle path. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> turned west on the bike path. Ha, 
Ha! The rest followed the hare and co-hare to their cars, and got in. But unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> heard the cars starting and came back. The hare threw him in the back with Seamus. Poor dog!  They regrouped at 
the school, and convoyed to a new restaurant:  Bill’s (or Joe’s, or Dick’s, or Mark’s, or Pete’s. Or someone’s!) The beer 
was weak, the songs were tired, but after this much beer with this little running, most of them needed the time to sober 
up. Not that that helps much.</p>
