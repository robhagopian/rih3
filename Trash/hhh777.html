 <font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom-boom, Bondo Jovi,
 WIPOS, P.W., The Slasher Dr. W.H.O., Shine On, Just John</font>.&nbsp; Virgins:
 <font color="#FF0000">Just Brian (2), Just Maggie</font>.&nbsp; Visitors: <font color="#FF0000">Eats
 Tail Sucks Head</font> (Houston H3)&nbsp; Masters: Ben, Jake, Baxter, Zoe..</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The pack gathered at the back of the parking lot
at &quot;The Lodge&quot; in Lincoln, in a timely and orderly fashion, thanks to
the central location of the trail, and the simple directions to the start. There
was no bowling alley seen for miles. Although somewhat disappointed by the
all-too-clement weather, it was realized with a wild surmise, that <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> was not present, and the hash was to start in one minute. With
screeching tires and 30 seconds to spare, <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>
arrived, offering up a sacrificial visitor to appease the crowd. This was<font color="#FF0000">
Eats Tail Sucks Head</font> (ETSH) from Houston, an experienced hasher whose
unusually tasteful name accurately reflects the elegant insouciance found
universally in the Lone Star State. Two virgins from the Navy also were
welcomed: the follicularly challenged <font color="#FF0000">Just Brian 2</font>
(&quot;2&quot;, to distinguish him from his Navy predecessor), and the pert and
spunky minx, <font color="#FF0000">Just Maggie</font>.<br>
<br>
The hash began. Crossing the street to enter the woods in a southwesterly
direction, the group was impressed to see that the hare had arranged a police
escort for the 20 yard trip into the woods. Leaving this behind, the trail began
most promisingly, with thorns, and steep paths around and over Quinsnicket Hill.
A skunk was sighted, but unfortunately, did not grace the dogs or the hounds
with his fragrance. At one point, the short-sighted <font color="#FF0000">ETSH</font>
thought he saw deer. &quot;You've got big deer up here,&quot; he observed, not
realizing he had interrupted a group of large naked individuals of confused
sexuality who had been lying in wait for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>.<br>
<br>
Up and down the trail led, with and unfortunate preponderance for cleared trail
and asphalt. There were a few areas of unavoidable water, and some beautifully
camouflaged mud in some of the low lying areas. However, the trail's challenges
can best be summarized by noting that for much of the run, <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> was an FRB. Most of the false trails supplied the best shiggy, and
this, given <font color="#FF0000">Shine On'</font>s general squeamishness, had
the unfortunate effect of keeping her on true trail while <font color="#FF0000">ETSH,
Dr. W.H.O</font>., and <font color="#FF0000">P.W. </font>mucked happily around
in the bushes.<br>
<br>
The trail led to Twin Rivers road, and thence to the main entrance to the woods,
where the trail led East into the camping areas and Tablerock Hill. The hare
coyly floured a few check marks after half the pack had passed, thinking that no
one would notice his retroactive trail marking habits. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
took a leisurely stroll on trail, and avoided the falsies which universally led
up hill. This confused Jake enough that he pursued an elderly couple of walkers
from Parsippany, NJ all the way around Olney Pond, thinking that at least they
were moving quickly. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> mostly admired his new
walking stick, but kept up a sage commentary at the checks, as he waited with <font color="#FF0000">Just
Brian</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Maggie</font> for Dr. W.H.O., and <font color="#FF0000">ETSH</font>
to return from the false trails. <font color="#FF0000">Just Maggie</font>
commented upon the quality of the briars. <font color="#FF0000">Just John </font>showed
his vigor and youth by running back and forth along the trail, shouting
&quot;On-on&quot; at every clump of used toilet paper in the bushes. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
got lost temporarily, but ultimately allowed his instincts for alcohol
consumption to guide himself and <font color="#FF0000">P.W</font>. to the group
at the Beer Check.<br>
<br>
The beer check was found after negotiating an unusual check with three false
marks on three trails, with a fourth side branch of the middle trail being true.
A &quot;BN&quot; mark was encountered, signifying, as it turned out that the
pack was NOWHERE near the beer. It was found and retrieved by <font color="#FF0000">ETSH</font>,
under a picnic table at the base of a cliff overlooking a pond some miles away.
Beer and pretzels were had atop the cliff. The only thing missing was canine
companionship, and Baxter, after having a swim in the pond, came up to the cliff
to shake water off his ample coat onto the virgins and <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> <font color="#FF0000">P.W.</font>,
Ben,and Zoe arrived, and all were present save Jake, who was looking for beer in
other venues. After a few brief songs, the pack was off.<br>
<br>
The short westward stroll back to the road and the lodge was uneventful.
Twilight had settled in, but flashlights were never really necessary. Basket
decided to go back to see if he could find the missing dog. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>planned to drive in, but as the group came back to The Lodge, the
smirking dog was encountered at the door to the restaurant, with beer and aged
prime rib on his breath. Two women, mother and daughter were with him (doing
what I can only imagine). The mother, aged seventy, came over to the bedraggled
hashers, to find out what they were up to. Explanations from <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> got her so excited that she
regaled them with tales of her speed-walking exploits in Lincoln Woods. While
the RIH3 recruiting team worked its magic, the rest prepared for the circle,
held in the wood behind the restaurant.<br>
<br>
The hare received exceptional marks, from a 13F from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
to an &quot;excellent run&quot; from <font color="#FF0000">Just Brian</font>.
The virgins were queried, and refused to show their rings. <font color="#FF0000">Just
Maggie</font> told the touching tale of a birdie with a yellow bill. Finally,
effort to name <font color="#FF0000">Just John</font> were made in an
exceptionally confused and disorderly manner, which could not be accounted for
by the beer, which was limited in quantity and intensity. &quot;All-Turd
Boy&quot;, &quot;Erectile Dysfunction&quot;, and &quot;Asshole&quot; were
suggested, and the preliminary hybrid &quot;All-Turd (or Altered?) E.D.&quot;
selected until the bewildered pack could come up with something better at a
later circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment of religion later, and all were inside
The Lodge.<br>
<br>
The Lodge had no out of uniform policemen this time, so the pack was fairly
well-behaved.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Just Maggie</font> found a tick
on her person. Unaccountably, she refused detailed physical examination of all
hair bearing area by professional (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
W.H.O</font>. and talented amateur (<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>) alike.
We'll see how she feels when she comes down with Lyme disease in some foreign
outpost. Nonetheless. she was &quot;alouetted&quot; in good spirits, and as the
evening ended, the pack could not get thrown out, and so had to pay the
exorbitant check.<br>
