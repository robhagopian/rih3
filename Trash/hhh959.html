<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Killingly, CT</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather,</font>&nbsp; 70’s, Light Rain at times</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font><br>
Async, Dr WHO, Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, Oozing SD, SESYB, PW, Seamus.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Visitors and Virgins:</font><br>
Becks (Singapore Harriets), Just Drew and Just Josh (one a virgin, one a short-timer from somewhere out of country), 
Follow My Tits (Hartford).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>An unusually large group gathered in the far western range of the RIH3, on Pond Road, just across the border in 
Killingly, CT. The mystery of why anyone would show up for one of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS’s</font> Connecticut 
runs was compounded by the appearance of <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>, long thought to be buried by angry 
co-workers under one of the concrete pilings in the Big Dig. No such luck. Promptly at 6:30 they were off into the 
mists heading north on Pond Road. Also known as the North-South Trail!</p>

<p>The two newcomers arrived after the main pack had left. Showing a singular lack of good judgment, they picked up 
trail. Showing an unhashman-like athleticism, they rapidly caught up with the pack at the first check at the junction 
of Quinn’s Hill Road and Pond Road. Introductions were given. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> finally found true 
trail going straight. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> were called back from 
the reservoir to the west. The pack continued north, entering the woods proper. Again, on the North-South Trail!</p>

<p>A few well-placed checks held the pack together for the most part. No bushwhacking was necessary, and the light rain 
and occasional puddles on the trails gave the only shiggy. As trail turned east, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
made his first and only correct choice of the evening and took the lead on a long and boring eastward path. But a check 
sent him left over a stream to an abandoned industrial area, while the rest continued towards the RI border. Still on 
the CT portion of the North-South Trail!</p>

<p>Marks now led slightly south to the northern shore of Killingly Pond and the beer check. <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> led, having regained his bearings and recognizing the lack of imagination on the part of the hare. The 
newcomers followed by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> arrived, and the beer 
was opened with most cooling off in the still-warm waters of the pond. Only Basket was missing, and a valiant effort 
was made, but the beer could not be finished before he turned up. He made it finally. By using the North-South Trail!</p>

<p>The beer finished and the light waning, they turned back on trail heading west, with instructions to look for a 
left turn. On the Old Kentuck Road. Otherwise known as the North-South Trail! No surprises on this part of the run, and 
they all made it back to Pond Road and the cars, to find Follow My Tits for Hartford, waiting in her car.</p>

<p>The circle was joined in some adjacent woods. The run was rated harshly, considering the lovely weather, virgins 
and visitors. But no one was lost, there was substantial rehashing, little shiggy, the return of <font color="#FF0000">
PW</font>, and most of all: excessive use of the North-South Trail! Total -6.9! Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>, of course. After virgins and visitors were dealt with, and religion completed, they drove back into RI 
for the On On On at the Bishop’s Hill Tavern in Scituate, about 6 miles east of the North-South Trail. The newcomers 
tried to involve the group in some political discussions. This of necessity led to loud and off-key renditions of some 
of the RIH3 favorites (once the food was delivered, of course).</p>
