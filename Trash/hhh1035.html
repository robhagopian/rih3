<p><font color="#008000">Run #1035</font>, January 30, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Pawtuxet River Park, Warwick.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 30’s, Light Rain.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Amish It Head, Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, Just Bob, Cum Under 
PSHS, Oozing SD, Fuwangi Boner, Amazon.cum, Seamus, Ben.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><i>(Note: <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> decided to try an audio recording of this hash as an experiment. The idea 
was to skip the painful process of writing Hash Trash. It came out quite clearly audible. Thus it is not fit to listen to. 
If anyone reading this wants a copy of the edited recording, cash or sexual favors will be accepted. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> will add you to his “Dangerously Psychotic” list. But then again, if you’re reading this, 
you’re already on the list.)</i></p>

<p>The hash gathered in Warwick in the parking lot of a Stop and Shop on Warwick Ave. The hare planned to live set, so all 
knew that this would really suck. But somehow, week after week, the same crowd shows up, hoping against hope that the hare 
will surprise with a quality trail. Was this to be a surprise? The newer ones (<font color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>) have an excuse of inexperience. The intelligent ones (<font color="#FF0000">SESYB
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>) were smart enough to stay away. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> probably 
broke one of his hermetic seals and stayed home. But the rest? Idiots and Wankers! As <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
pointed out during the run and throughout his rating at the circle, this was Pawtetic!</p>

<p>The hare set off. A few minutes later at 6:30, the rest followed. Trail led south out of the parking lot, and then out 
to Warwick Ave. Confusion, screeching brakes, honking and near-misses resulted, as the hashers tried to find trail 
crossing the busy road. Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> found flour heading back north on Warwick Ave. They 
crossed the Pawtuxet River on the road, and turned right into a parking lot, and into the woods. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led as they came up to the Silver Hook branch of the 
river, and began bushwhacking through some briars and old garbage. It was looking good! But before long, they spilled back 
out at a service station, and were back on pavement. Pawtetic!</p>

<p>A check at Dallas Ave was obvious. Unless the hare was really planning to get hashit for life, he had to turn east to 
follow the Pawtuxet River Park. And luckily for him, that’s what he did. The hashers didn’t hesitate, but turned east on 
Dallas. A second check soon came, equally obvious. Let’s see. Should we continue straight on this boring road? Or should 
we turn right into Fay Field, and follow the path in the woods to the river. Even <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> got 
it right! Pawtetic!</p>

<p>The trail entered the woods heading south. A boardwalk covered over the initial marshes, but once off this, the rain 
provided some good puddles and mud. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> led, but went straight at the next check. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried left, and found true trail. He called them all on. Except <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. They went straight, blowing past a false marker. Things were looking up! 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> entered a swamp. WOW! Everyone was happy. Especially <font color="#FF0000">Cum 
Under</font>. Somehow she managed to find all the sink holes in the swamp as she brought up the rear. Lucky girl! 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font> complained about the lack of shiggy.</p>

<p>But all good things come to an end. Coming out of the swamp, they ran into <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. And 
pavement. And more pavement. Pawtetic. The trail led to “Rhodes on the Pawtuxet”, and then along Woodbury and out to Broad 
Street in Pawtuxet Village. The river was crossed south at the Pawtuxet Falls. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> led, 
well out in front. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed as they turned west 
on Post Road. They came to a check. Let’s see. Should trail go straight on this boring road? Or would it turn right at the 
sign for the Pawtuxet River Park Trails into the woods. Hmm! What a poser! Pawtetic!</p>

<p>Trail passed north next to the river, briefly entered an industrial parking lot with stacks of sewer pipes (clean ones, 
unfortunately) and then back into the woods, following the turn of the river to the BC. The hare was waiting and the beer 
was quickly found and opened. It was a lovely spot. Gentle rain in a birch grove next to a rolling river, with good beer, 
and no sign of <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>. Or <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>! Good times!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> arrived. Well, you can always welcome the bimbos. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> arrived. Sigh. Then to top off the misery, lights were seen across the river. It was <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>! And <font color="#FF0000">Amazon.cum</font>! Like, give us a paper cut and pour lemon 
juice on it! Unaccountably, they refused to swim across, so it was hoped for a while that they might yet get lost. But the 
actual distance wasn’t that great. The group was unable to: a) finish the beer, b) obscure the marks beyond the sewer 
pipes, or c) hide behind the birch trees (Thanks again Ben, you canine WANK!!) before they arrived. So they were all 
together briefly. Pawtetic! But having sung all seventeen songs associated with Rhubarb, the BC ended. Soon they were 
on-out, to finish this disaster off.</p>

<p>Trail was virtually unmarked beyond this point. The hare gave instructions that were mostly ignored. They started out 
on the river trail but soon came out into an industrial parking lot. Rather than stay on the river, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> decided that it would be quicker to go on the street. He thus was able to add an unnecessary 
half-mile to the trail as he lead <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> out Pioneer Ave to Bellows. At least they didn’t turn the wrong way. But <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> and the hare 
were all waiting at the cars when they finally stumbled back into the Stop and Shop.</p>

<p>The circle was formed just in the woods at the back of the lot. Ratings for the run included such factors as rain, 
swamp, garbage in briars, and virgin territory. But this could not outweigh the excessive pavement, <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> at the BC, and the use of the word “antithetical” by <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> at 
the circle. (Antithetical, from the Latin: “anti-“ meaning mother’s sister, and “thetical” meaning corrective eyewear worn 
by one with a lisp) (But I digress.) Total: <b>-0.69</b>. Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, of course. Finishing 
the circle with a partly spoken version of “In Mobile” by <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font>, and a prolonged and 
pathetic attempt at naming <font color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font>, marred any good memories that anyone might have taken 
from this run. Somehow, he ended up as “MicroHard”. (Even a careful perusal of the recorded 
transcript of the circle can’t justify this! Pawtetic!)</p>

<p>The On On On was at Billy’s Frosted Mug, the call of the hot wieners too hard to resist. The usual rounds of pool and 
darts were initiated, the wieners were distributed and the evening ended with a few songs, barely audible a few feet 
beyond the tables, thanks to the incessant metal rock blaring from the jukebox. Trying as hard as humanly possible, the 
hash STILL could not offend the regular clientele. Pawtetic!</p>
