It's been a long time since we were here...starting at the trailhead to Ryan Park, NK off Oak HIll Rd.
I don't know why I was so early, but it was me and the Hare's car for the longest time. WHO arrived about the same time as the Hare, back from setting trail. He offered me and WHO a beer and said he was off to set the beer stop. Rusty was next and grabbed a Little Sister just as JtT left the lot at 6:06. Slowly, one by one, the pack grew and grew. OMIT, Just Alex, PG, Just Pat, WIPOS, and OOZing parked in the small lot, as we watched a line of bikers with lights ablazing slide by like ships in the night. The Hare returned at 6:25. That meant it would be 20+ minutes to beer and another 20+ back, roughly. At 6:30:29, we started out on the main trail. The first check sent most of the pack left towards Rte 4. I was checking the right trail, and circling back decided to stay on the main trail while keeping an ear out for the pack between me and Rte 4. All went well, until I hit the parking lot on Lafayette Rd trailhead. <br/><br/>
Turning around it wasn't long before I spied some marks on the trees in the woods to my left. I took the first opening and found myself on a, well marked, ridgeline trail. Soon I hit the first of many checks. Most of these had multiple options, so I covered a lot of fuckin' ground as I could hear the pack closing in. I marked as many checks as I could, but feared I'd miss out on a Captain's Daughter if I didn't get lucky and find the BS first.<br/><br/>
I could hear Rusty and OOzing breathing hard as they found my marked checks and called on the pack. Soon Rusty was telling me the trail was found to my rear and then the Just Pat found the beer. "Shit!" If it was anyone else, I may have had a chance at a CD, but by the time I got there 7 Wankers were tossing down beer. I settled for a 60 minute IPA. Eventually, JtT had to go out and retrieve OMIT and WIPOS, and we were whole again. Songs were sung and beers enjoyed before setting out at WHO's request.<br/><br/>
It was a short walk back to the cars and the Circle. As luck would have it, I found a Captain's Daughter and was very happy with myself. Ratings were mostly positive, even from WHO, but it was settled on a negative zero. No other business was needed so we moved to Hashit. It was almost on Rusty's shoulders, and should have been, until I told the story of my neighbor getting a job as a Diesel Fitter. I asked what he did, as it was in the ladies underwear section of a local store. He said he'd take them, put them over his head and if they were the correct size, he say, "des 'll fit her." AnyWHO, I got it and this is what I remember from last night.
