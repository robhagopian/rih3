<P><br><font color="#0000ff">The 
Run:<BR> </font><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hare 
assigned the 1169<SUP>th</SUP> hash knew that for a special occasion like this, 
loads of hashers were bound to show up. Beer is getting kind of expensive, 
though. So he felt it best to arrange the start in Tiverton, far enough away 
from Providence to discourage the casual and the lazy from attending. He even 
went so far as to make some homemade crap T-shirts to hawk at the end of the 
run, so as to try to break even financially. If only another physician had 
showed up, he would have been able to deduct the whole thing from his taxes. But 
then again, the only other physician in the hash is <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, so ultimately he counted himself 
lucky.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail started 
out from the Weetamoo Woods Parking area on Lafayette Rd, west on the road. The 
hare instructed the pack to look for a left turn, so naturally, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Colin</FONT> kept on going. They would have reached the water 
(and maybe drowned?) if <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT> hadn’t called 
them back to the large and obvious true-trail arrow they had missed. Marks led 
into the Pardon Gray Preserve, and out onto the fallow pastures. There was some 
confusion at the next check. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> led a group into 
the woods due east. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> found the real trail 
continuing south along the border of the field, and then turning east on trail 
back towards Weetamoo.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The group came 
out onto the yellow trail, where a check sent <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> 
(whining about his broken foot) and <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> (whining 
about always taking the wrong trail at the checks) south on a long falsie. The 
rest turned north led by <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Colin</FONT>. They ended up on 
the trail portion of Lafayette road, about 100 yards east of their cars. Ha, Ha! 
An arrow sent them past a large and prominently displayed “No Trespassing” sign, 
continuing north. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail was filled 
with thorns and fallen trees. It appeared to be bushwhacking until a Nature 
Conservancy sign was found. This is their excuse for a path. The going was slow 
and the group was pretty much together as they began to curve east through some 
recently cut paths through dense rhododendrons. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Colin</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> began to pull ahead. Finally, after a brief 
bushwhack, they came to a rise and managed to stir up a buried yellow jacket 
hive. Just in time to ensure that the rest (especially <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT>) would receive more than a fair share of 
stings.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Things were 
looking up. They came to a legitimate path. Another long falsie. Another chance 
for <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> to 
whine about taking the wrong path. True trail turned south. It wound over some 
boulders and small hills until it finally led to the Beer Check. The stragglers 
in, the beer and fine snacks were provided by the hare. Some songs were sung. 
Some generalized whining about broken feet, injured knees, bee-stings, cramps 
etc. filled the air. Hashing at its finest.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">On out trail led 
back south to Lafayette “Road”. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>It 
was just starting to get dark, and a few flashlights were taken out for the 
first time. A check was ignored by most, as the hare led straight (sick of all 
the whining and ready for dinner). They came back west, and down to the cars. 
The circle formed up. Ratings included fine thorns, excellent stinging-insect 
and tick populations, large amounts of whining, and only 69 yards of pavement. 
Total: +6.9! The visitor from Newport was queried, and chastised for not 
bringing more bimbos. Hashit was given to <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, for 
boasting about always taking the wrong trail at the 
checks.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The circle was 
closed in the usual manner. They convoyed on to Li’l Bear where the kitchen was 
closed, so they had to make do with Tiverton’s Famous Pizza delivery. But 
another inexpensive evening resulted. Crappy T-shirts were sold, and a few songs 
were sung to the bartender and the clientele, who whistled through their few 
remaining teeth to show their approval. It doesn’t get much better than 
this!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
