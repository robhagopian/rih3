<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Primrose Fire Station, North Smithfield was the choice for tonight’s
hash.&nbsp; By the time <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT> arrive from
setting the beer stop, hounds <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo, Jake</FONT>
and <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT> were scouting out flour, while <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Dave</FONT>
and <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozing</FONT> were trying to keep warm by pacing
the rear lot looking for a free beer.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT>
gave all a shot of Irish Whiskey to warm the cockles then pointed out the
start. Amid <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>’s cry’s of “I knew we were
going up to the Woonsocket Hill Tower, we crossed Rte 5 into a new bird
sanctuary.&nbsp; Moments later, tail between his legs, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>
replies, “Oh, I guess we are going into a new area.”
<BR>Shiggy wasn’t readily available at the start, but in time all things
would cum.&nbsp; Following trail, the hounds made their way over hill and
dale, and eventually found flour leading to the power lines.&nbsp; It was
at this point, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT> falling far behind, left
the pack and went straight uphill on the power lines looking for beer at
the top.&nbsp; The rest of the pack followed trail into a swamp, now slightly
firming up in the frozen night air, and out again onto dry land for only
a short time.&nbsp; Back into another swamp soon after left no feet dry
or warm.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozing </FONT>didn’t mind, as his
sprained ankle, numbed by the frozen water, felt much better.
<BR><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT> in the lead kept calling back to
the hare many terms of affection, as he fell knee deep in frozen muck.
<BR>The trail led through a back yard, crossing Rte 5 again, and straight
uphill.&nbsp; Eventually winding our way to the tower.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>
was right, but nowhere in sight.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket </FONT>by
this time had recovered the beer bag cleverly hidden along the trail, and
followed the pack back downhill to the waiting Beer Stop.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>
had short cut to the beer stop, but couldn’t enjoy his success, because
the beer hadn’t arrived yet.&nbsp; We found him searching in every scrub
brush and behind every rock.&nbsp; When the bag was finally opened curses
of “Fuck You Asshole” were repeated towards the hare.
<BR>On In was downhill straight to the Fire Station, and a circle would
be formed at <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT>’s house.&nbsp; Down Downs
were given to the hare (<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT>), shortcutter
(<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>), hashit (<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozing)</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Asshole T.F.N</FONT>. (newly named Dave), last weeks
homophobic (<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT>), and then additional DD’s
for assorted offenses, real or imagined.&nbsp; Then we enjoyed a great
Corned Beef and Cabbage Irish dinner…farts enough for everyone.
