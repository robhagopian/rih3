<p><i>If</i> you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other hashtrash. In 
this hashtrash, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. 
This is because not very many happy things happen in the lives of the Rhode Island Hash House Harriers. <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish It Head</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Great at Giving Head</font>, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom 
Boom</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD</font> were unintelligent hashers, and they were 
annoying, and pathetic, and had unpleasant facial features, but they were also extremely unlucky, and most everything that 
happened to them was rife with misfortune, misery, and despair. I'm sorry to tell you this, but that is how the story 
goes.</p>

<p>Their misfortune began one day at F. Gilbert Hills. This particular evening it was dark and chilly, which didn't bother 
the hashers one bit. When it was hot and sunny, trail was crowded with tourists and it was impossible to find a good place 
to drink one's beer. On dark and chilly days, the hashers had the woods to themselves to do what they liked. The hare, a 
walking misfortune if ever there was, had decided to set trail in a tired old spot, north of the border in Foxboro, 
Massachusetts. This unhappy park is frequented by hooligans, muggers, thieves and, all-too often, the RIH3. I would 
recommend that you skip the hash the next time trail is set here. Or the next time this hare sets anywhere, for that 
matter. But that’s just the way I feel.</p>

<p>As the group gathered in the deepening gloom, the hare broke out some “beer” to try and cheer up the early arrivals. 
But <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> were there, and immediately started 
squabbling. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> chose this ill-advised moment to return to the hash, and incredibly chose 
to dress like the hare in multiple protective layers. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> showed up with a festering sore 
on his lip. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> attacked Seamus, and lost his car keys in the bushes. <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> picked his nose. (It would be his last chance for several weeks, but he didn’t know that, 
just yet!) <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> tried some pick-up lines on the exceptionally uninterested <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>. The visitor watched, amazed and depressed that he had decided to come. I would think you 
would have been depressed, too.</p>

<p>Finally, six-thirty rolled around. They headed out, south from the Radio Tower on a path. It was immediately apparent 
that there had been a sale on baking flour at BJ’s. Every rock, stump and fallen branch bore witness to the hare’s 
passage.  There was no shiggy. So a line formed, with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi
</font> in the lead, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> bringing up the rear. The first check led to a long 
well-marked trail culminating in an “X” at the edge of a cliff. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> got there first. He 
contemplated ending it all by continuing straight, but instead called the rest on, as he sneakily circled back to the 
trail in the bushes. Unfortunately, no one else decided to continue straight, either. I’m sorry, again.</p>

<p>Trail continued briefly south. After a brief time on a dirt road, trail continued east into a maze of checks and poorly 
cleared paths. But it wasn’t what you’d call shiggy, not by any stretch! <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, knowing this 
area like the back of <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> ass, pulled further and further ahead, and probably was 
already at the beer stop by this point in the narrative. [That didn’t do him any good at all. This hare may be dumb, but 
he knows how to hide his beer. Even he himself couldn’t find it, when he arrived later on. But I depress.] And to make 
things even worse, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> had arrived, and were on 
trail back near the start. There were hashers all over, on rocky outcroppings, in bushes, on and off paths, and deep in 
valleys (or depressions, as they might as well be called). The hare tried to call them together with his horn. But it blew 
the same note as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> Conch shell, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> bugle. So 
everyone went the other way. And still missing was any sign of shiggy. This made them all very sad. I know they all 
expected more from this hare, who has usually been very creative with swampland. But it has been an unusually dry March.
</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was the first (since <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, who had passed this way 30 
minutes before) to find trail turning north. Only to come upon <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>. They both were 
unhappy, now.  But they called the rest on, and came over a rise to find the hare at a check on High Rock Road. Consulting 
the handy trail map posted there, they proceeded straight uphill, on a wooded path. Soon they came to a check, and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turned right, while <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> went straight. <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> appeared to be on, as there was a sign, welcoming Hashers (or Hikers, or something. The light was very dim. As 
was the group. But I digress.). He called <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>. But this also drew <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> was now very miserable. But they followed <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font>. He had turned off his flashlight. He stood over the almost inevitable “X”. He dropped his shorts to provide 
alternative illumination to guide the others. But his “moonlight” wasn’t very bright. It was however, enough to make 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> gag, and to make <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> have some impure thoughts. I 
bet you think this couldn’t get any worse. Well, you’re wrong!</p>

<p>The trio went back to the trail and continued north. But right behind them was <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 
with <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and the visitor. <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> called “False Trail!” and doubled back. Only <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was fooled. But it was a bright 
moment for the rest. Trail came out to some dirt roads labeled “Loop Trails”. There was more confusion. But still no 
shiggy. Most found the proper check left into the woods. But <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed the loop off trail, 
and ended up in the lead. He promptly lost this when he headed down the On Out trail. But the hare was calling from the 
BC, so he turned back. Southwest on Messenger Road, trail turned right. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> came upon <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> watching the 
hare trying to find his own beer, at a shelter in the woods. They all were depressed. But then the hare found the beer! 
They saw what kind of beer he had! Their depression turned to despair! Even the fire that the hare started couldn’t cheer 
them up. Personally, I wouldn’t have blamed them if they had roasted the hare on his own fire!</p>

<p>The rest of the poor unfortunates straggled in. To find that: in addition to the horrible choices of beer available, 
there were only eleven beers. For twelve hashers! <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> went into the shed to recheck the 
hare’s knapsack. Empty-handed, he turned and smashed his forehead and nose on the eaves of the hut’s low roof. Luckily, 
the hut was stoutly built, and suffered at most, a minor crack in a two-by-four. And <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi’s
</font> appearance improved immeasurably, once the bleeding stopped. So everyone was cheered enough to sing a few songs. 
You see, even the worst experiences have their good aspects!</p>

<p>After dousing the fire (only <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had any urine to contribute on this fearfully dry 
outing), they made the short jog west back to the cars. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> found that he had left his car 
keys in his door lock. He found his wallet and cell-phone missing. You see! I was right about the hooligans, muggers and 
thieves! But the circle must go on, and it did. The run was rated. Comments mentioned the lack of shiggy, the lack of lost 
hashers (especially <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>), the non-virgin territory, 
and the beer choices. But no pavement, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi’s</font> new nose job, and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket’s</font> lost billfold enabled the hare to salvage a <b>-0.69</b>! Hashit was given to <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. Why not? The visitor was questioned, the backslider punished, and the circle closed. I 
think they all were ready to move on to get some real beer, don’t you?</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> as always took off early, while <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> lent <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> his phone. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> called <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font>, 
and you could hear her yelling clean through <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> head to his other ear. But just as he 
hung up (and in Glendale, <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font> started cancelling credit cards), <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> returned. He had found the wallet in the road. With all the cards in it. Ha, ha! And now <font 
color="#FF0000">Dogmeat’s</font> line was busy. Ha, ha! Another unfortunate event that turned out for the best. Don’t we 
all need to get rid of some of our credit cards? I think <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> would thank the thieves, if 
he had the chance.</p>

<p>Off they went at the hares direction, to Chieftain’s on Rt 1 in Plainville. Now, they hate us at Chieftain’s. We’ve 
been thrown out of Chieftain’s, more than once. There are no pitchers at Chieftain’s. But the hare insisted. He wanted 
some clams. (Even though it’s too early in the season, and they still taste of winter sewage.) So to Chieftain’s they 
went, ten of them, and had expensive food, fecal/hepatitis-laden steamers, and bangers-and-mash, washed down with Guinness 
and Black-and-Tans. They tried a few songs. They tried to reach <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font>. They tried to figure 
out if they had enough money to cover the exorbitant bill. The visitor tried to figure out if they would buy it if he said 
he had to pick someone up at the airport. And the evening ended, as all evenings do. But I don’t think anyone learned 
their lesson, do you?</p>
