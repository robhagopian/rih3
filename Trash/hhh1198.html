their appearance in honor of St. Patrick’s, but most decided to skip this 
opportunity. The start began with an annoying and meaningless clockwise loop 
around the playing fields. The only effects this had were to annoy, and to allow 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> to become FRB, by shortcutting to the real 
trail, heading east. The rest soon caught up. They crossed the dam at the south 
end of Belleville pond, and turned north. For the experienced hashers, the 
checks were easily mastered as it was obvious that trail would lead to the old 
railroad grade. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Katie</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Diana</FONT> were getting lost.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

encountered, leading to a swamp traverse (also annoying and meaningless, not to 
mention dangerous to kilts, and their wearers). Out of the swamp, trail on paths 
was regained, and followed south to the beer check on the bridge over the 
narrows on Belleville Pond. The co-hare was waiting with the beer. And <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. Therapy will be needed. The beer was consumed and 
horns and whistles blown to try to attract the lost ladies. Finally, search 
parties were sent out. The hare ended up repeating most of the trail. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Steve</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> backtracked. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> 
tried to get himself lost again. Flashlights were finally 
required.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

the circle, but could come up with no real song. Hashit went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>! (Perhaps it was because there hadn’t been much singing 
and it was only 7:45. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> knows?) On On On was of 
course the Steak Fry at the Oakhill Tavern.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
