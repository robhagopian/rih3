<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The venue was Burriville school, attendees were
Hopeless, Little Neck and yours truly with our live hare being Basket.
The temperature was definitely brass monkey weather. The hare was given
a seven minute start before the pack roared off, behind the school your
scribe soon found himself at the back of the pack after taking two false
checks. The surprise FRB was Little Neck who was way out front after taking
two correct guesses at the early checks, the pack quickly settled on chalk
running beside the water. Two very obvious checks to try and tempt us over
water but nobody was going to fall for that one. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Eventually as always on Baskets run we ended up
running through thorns up onto a small gauge railway up a road ominously
heading towards Baskets house, the pack thought this to be too obvious
a beer check and continued to be confronted with a chicken/eagle split
Little Neck decided to go up the, you guessed it, the chicken route, Hopeless
and yours truly being real hashers took the eagle route, soon to be followed
by Little Neck who hates to run on his own. Under a bridge off marks we
all returned to go up the chicken run when Hopeless spotted chalk off left,
it really helps if chalk is not put where they can be run over by vehicles
plus marks should be put on the side of the road facing traffic, otherwise
their will be fewer runners as we get gradually wiped out by cars, unless
that was the plan? The pack upped the pace leaving yours truly at the rear
to ward off any fenders, as the pack thought my rear end being big enough
to make drivers swerve, not wishing to cause permanent damage to their
cars. Through another set of thorns down a bank onto road then down to
Baskets car to which we found the keys to get the most crucial part-BEER.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Basket not being around many schemes were connived,
should we drive his car away? Hopeless being a cautious soul thought that
if three sweaty alcohol smelling runners were stopped by a police car and
none of us could provide a license in a car which was not ours, this could
be a problem. Another thought was to take the keys, Little Neck was convinced
Basket was looking on, he obviously doesn’t like being watched since he
got caught wanking in the bath by his mum, trying to convince her it was
an oriental massage to improve brainpower, by the way it didn’t work. The
pack set off and did a loop back towards the car until we came across a
falsie, we all thought this was a poor piece of trail laying and the hare
deserved the Hashshit for that piece of crap, perhaps Basket should try
and turn his flashlights on from time to time, but we all realize that
the lighting of the wicks can be tricky when one is trotting. The pack
returned to the road where Hopeless took his normal place at the front
with Little Neck now flagging having been so long at the front even your
scribe who is always a strong finisher (that’s what the old lady always
tells me) catching fast. At this point we heard that Hopeless could see
our live hare just ahead and was catching fast when the hare realized he
was about to be bagged and those little hairy legs apparently found another
gear, probably the fear of Hopeless coming in from behind with his spike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The second beer stop and theoretically the end
of the run was a public watering hole, your scribe also moved up a gear
(it was the smell of beer) and went tearing past Little Neck to come in
silver medal position. Every week all runners come in the first three sometimes
the sole participant wins gold! A few beers were had at this watering hole
before we headed back to Baskets car, Little Neck was not to keen to run
back as his energy was fast draining but he finally arrived at the car
to find the rest of the pack asleep from waiting. On back to Baskets pad
for a circle up or in our case a triangle where a large stone was placed
in the middle to place one’s posteria on, all attendees left their mark!
On in for the food which was absolutely the cats whiskers-great job Dog
meat. </FONT></P>
