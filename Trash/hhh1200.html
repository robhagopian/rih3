was a run this day. But I didn’t take any notes. And, being a <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> run, it probably wasn’t all that memorable, anyways. 
SO, unless one of you wanks wants to step up to the plate, there’ll be no write 
up for this one. Oh, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> was Hashit!<BR><BR>OK, 
OK! I think it was another one of those annoying hashes from the powerlines 
opposite Joe's Rock in West Wrentham, MA. East to Burnt Swamp Road, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> fooled into going on road, the rest carried on on 
trail turning back north, then west. The trail crossed the powerlines for a 
meaningless jaunt north, and disappeared.&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> crossed back and led <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> to the hare, chortling in his beer. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> finally showed up, with another boring tale of his 
intrepid (insipid) shortcutting. <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> came last, 
from and almost inconceivable direction.<BR><BR>Trail back was on the 
powerlines, and marked by extreme and unsuccessful efforts to avoid the swamp 
shiggy in the dips on the trail. (Actually, the Dips on the trail were all <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> had had the bad judgement to show up in the first 
place.) Ratings for the run: shiggy, yes, but recycled for at least the 69th 
time, no bimbos, <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> not lost, etc., etc. Total: 
-6.9. On On On was at <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo's</FONT>, probably. But everyone 
that showed up has acquired at least some immunity, so the septic systems of RI 
were mostly safe, that night at least.</SPAN>
