<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">The Fuwangi’s Third Try is a Charm Hash (not?)</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1061</font>, July 31, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Visiting Scribe:</font>&nbsp; Taste Like Chicken Leg, drumstick and âne de poulet</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Stop and Shop, Mendon Rd, Cumberland, again.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Hot and pitifully dry</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; DrWHO, Oozing, G@GH, Just Justin, Just Bobby, Dry Foot, Fuwangi, Amish 
Shithead, Basket, Bondo Jovi and Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>This was not the first time <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> tried to lay something here, not the second, and it 
most likely won’t be the last. But at least he’s up for it, unlike our last date, but I digress into whine mode. Sigh!</p>

<p>The hopeful pack gathered at the rear parking lot behind S&S on Mendon Rd. Each had their own private parking spaces 
now, as our frequency has caused management to keep us separate from the customers. Our names were on signs, with <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> having the closest to the store, with a designation of “Hasher of the Month”, for his 
unswerving attempt to so frequently join us, despite having to catch the train from Beantown. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> was last to arrive and the moans from the pack for not leaving before his arrival was palatable. Ben was his usual 
annoying self, trying to get on with it, as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> tried to hide his bike in the back of his 
van.</p>

<p>After a couple beers, we set off in the usual direction behind the store. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led the pack out toward the bike path, with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> taking the bike path, followed by the bulk of the pack. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
chose straight on, with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> right on his butt. I’m sure it was not pleasant for either.</p>

<p>Cries of “On On” were heard from the bridge on the bike path, so they converged there, with most going north reliving 
the horror of this past winter’s ski hash, while a few brave soles went left and found true trail. <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> continued straight on the path towards Berkley, ignoring the calls back.</p>

<p>The pack continued on towards the parking lot on Front St, led by <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, where another check had all confused. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had not been seen in 
some time and many voiced their concern about his well being. Meanwhile, he had continued out to Lonsdale Ave and thinking 
this Hare can not possibly come up with something new, ran directly to the bridge over the Blackstone, and found an arrow 
pointing down to the location of his last 2 whiskey stops here.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> blew his horn to call the pack on, and he blew and he blew. Finally deciding, “it 
was enough, f#@k them; I’m going for the booze.” He found a bottle of Makers Mark cleverly hidden under the bridge I beam, 
and upon hearing the pack nearing, took the bottle and hid himself and it under the bridge, while enjoying the smooth 
taste of success.</p>

<p>The pack arrived, sans <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and the complaining Hare was whining that <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> stole the bottle. Spreading out in a search, the pack finally found him and all enjoyed the 
respite. Calls for the missing, but promised <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> resulted in no success; No one 
called for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. A number of songs were sung and eventually all good things must end, so we 
continued back on trail.</p>

<p>We followed the river south, past a number of houses high up hill, with dogs barking and annoyed home owners wondering 
just <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> the trespassers were. The Just’s, <font color="#FF0000">Bobby</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Justin</font>, stayed close to the pack, for fearing getting lost in the high reeds and shiggy along the 
rivers edge. They were ecstatic when we turned uphill towards the roadway and out of harms way, however we quickly turned 
left back down towards the river and out along a well worn path.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> in the lead had stopped at a port-a-potty and was relieving himself, when he heard 
thundering footsteps outside. He peered out the screen and saw <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangii</font> charging down to tip him over. He cut the stream short and beat it (out of there), and he continued 
straight along the river path at the check. Most tried to keep up with his speedy retreat, but <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Justin</font> went right following an arrow made 
by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to confuse the RRB’s. At the end <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> found beer and 
tried to hide, in the water, from the pitifully slow pack. But it was too deep to wade across and the heavy beer would 
have sunk and been lost. Unselfishly he came back on shore with the catch.</p>

<p>Most arrived now, and opened beer as songs commenced. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> arrived somewhat later on his 
bike and shortly after that we heard calls of “RU?” from across the swamp. The lost <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Justin</font> had heard our singing and swam across the 
smelly green slime pool that separated us. All enjoyed beers and singing until the beer was gone, despite the smell of our 
late arrivals. Then we made our way out to Lonsdale Ave and back to the cars.</p>

<p>We circled up in the poison ivy between the parking lot and bike path, and gave the hare his down-down and an ‘Attaboy’ 
for being persistent and almost making this one work. Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for the use 
of mechanical tools on trail and missing the first beer stop. The OnOn was at Tucks where the usual fare and beverages 
were delightfully consumed. <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> was called to find out why she didn’t join us, and 
evidently good sense overcame the urge to run with old smelly men in swamps.</p>

<p>A note from the scribe: While I may not have been there in body, I felt your pain. Having been close to the Hare on a 
number of occasions lately and having to listen to his bragging about the success of his endeavor, I sure his actual 
accomplishment at setting a good trail fell as short as his weenie.</p>
