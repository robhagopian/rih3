</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine-On? Dog Meat? Sweet Molasses</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">?
What happened to the two wimmin archaeologists from Brown, you remember
the one who discovered the remains of the first RI Hash at Bell Pond?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">OK, now listen up, this is serious. When you needed
the Hash, we were there for you. Now where are YOU?? The </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Necker</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
is lost in lust, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">thinks
more of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Jake</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
than he does the Hash, and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Beyond Hope</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
is, well, plainly beyond hope. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">So next Monday we're showing up on one of your
doorsteps, and if you don't have a run ready to go, we drink all the piss
in your fridge, sodomize the family pet, and Basket runs around the house,
and your neighbor's houses, naked and yelling &quot;WOW, THAT'S REALLY
GOOD S**T YOU'RE SELLING!&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We should have done that at the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Necker's</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
except the only pets he has are cockroaches, and the DEM was smart enough
to keep him away from neighbors. Instead we just helped ourselves to (his)
fresh garden produce and had the On-On-On there. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
brought out the remains of several birds that had got stuck in some yellow
goo that he left by the street overnight. He called it chicken marinated
in curry sauce. When grilled, though, the birds were amazingly good, especially
when washed down with plenty of cold piss. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was also thoughtful enough to provide an O'Doul's for </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short
Shorts</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">, as she is still drying out. And </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
also has a clever way of bringing the On-On-On to a quick close. &quot;Here's
some betel nut stuff, wrapped in tinfoil, that I brought back from Houston
last night. Nobody in Houston could choke it down, but I know you guys
will eat anything.&quot; Just before he retched onto the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Necker'</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">s
lawnmower, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
said &quot;tastes - umm - kind of like the - uh - pink soap you get in
men's - ughh - toilets.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The run? The usual great run that stuffed up </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> just
before the On-In. The On-Out was past the 155mm field gun of the Cumberland
War Memorial, left into miles of woods with an imaginative assortment of
checks which after 45 minutes led up to a scenic overlook cum beer stop
at the edge of a HUGE quarry. All the RI landmarks were identified by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">, e.g.,
the East Providence water tower, the top of the Banc Boston tower, the
bottom of the pit, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket's </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">swollen
member, fascinating. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The second half of the run was unrelenting drizzle,
acres of poison ivy for the short-cutting bastards (yours truly), and no</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> at all. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and his stupid horn disappeared at the power lines, and from then on the
run was incredibly pleasant. On-In after 1:15 for the hare, followed by
two unknown joggers, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short-Shorts,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
a Boston Terrier, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Tinker</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
and fifteen minutes later, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Well done Oozing, a 0.69 on any scale.</FONT></P>
