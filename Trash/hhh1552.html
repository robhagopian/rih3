On Monday Night, The Hare Next Week had his wank grasped in his hands, which was his proudest possession. It was long and black and glossy and Next Week waved it around just so that the Kennel would look at it. Basket Book Boom saw this. Basket Boom Boom, as everyone knows, is a trickster and likes nothing better than fooling others. So it was that he decided to play a trick on Next Week. It was the time of year when Rusty, the Spirit of the spuds, had swept across the land, covering the lakes with mashed potatoes and pounding on the trees with his big Potato masher. Basket made a hole in the mashed potatoes, right near a place where Next Week liked to walk. By the time Next Week came by, all around Basket Boom Boom, in a big circle, were tasty Brews and mounds of orange food. Just as Next Week was about to ask Basket Boom Boom what he was doing, Basket Boom Boom twitched his wank which he had sticking through that hole in the mashed potatoes and pulled out a huge Bottle of Bondo Brew.

<br/><br/>'On On, Hare,' said Basket Boom Boom. 'How are you this fine Night?'

<br/><br/>'On On,' answered Next Week, looking at the big circle of deliciousness. ' I am well, Wanker. But what are you doing?'

<br/><br/>'I am fishing,' answered Basket Boom Boom. 'Would you like to try?'

<br/><br/>'Oh, yes,' said Next Week, as he started to lumber over to Basket’s fishing hole. 

<br/><br/>But Basket Boom Boom stopped him. 'Wait, Wanker,' he said, 'This place will not be good. As you can see, I have already caught all the Brews and orange food. Let us make you a new fishing spot where you can catch many big Brews.'

<br/><br/>Next Week agreed and so he followed Basket Boom Boom to the new place, a place where, as Basket Boom Boom knew very well, the lake was too shallow to catch the Bondo Brew: which always stay in the deepest water when Rusty has covered their ponds. Next Week watched as Basket Boom Boom made the hole in the potatoes, already tasting the fine Brew he would soon catch. 'Now,' Basket Boom Boom said, 'you must do just as I tell you. Clear your mind of all thoughts of Brew. Do not even think of a Hash song or the Brew will hear you. Turn your back to the hole and place your wank inside it. Soon a bottle of home Brew will come and grab your wank and you can pull it out.' 

<br/><br/>'But how will I know if a brew has grabbed my wank if my back is turned?' asked Next Week.

<br/><br/>'I will hide over here where the brew cannot see me,' said Basket Boom Boom. 'When a Brew grabs your Wank, I will shout. Then you must pull as hard as you can to catch your Brew. But you must be very patient. Do not move at all until I tell you.'

<br/><br/>Next Week nodded, 'I will do exactly as you say.' He sat down next to the hole, placed his long beautiful black wank in the mashed potato filled water and turned his back.

<br/><br/>Basket Boom Boom watched for a time to make sure that Next Week was doing as he was told and then, very quietly, sneaked back to his own house and went to bed. The next morning he woke up and thought of Next week. 'I wonder if he is still there,' Basket Boom Boom said to himself. 'I'll just go and check.'

<br/><br/>So Basket Boom Boom went back to the mashed potato covered pond and what do you think he saw? He saw what looked like a little white hill in the middle of the potatoes. It had snowed during the night and covered Next Week, who had fallen asleep while waiting for Basket Boom Boom to tell him to pull his wank and catch a brew. And Next Week was snoring. His snores were so loud that the potatoes were shaking. It was so funny that Basket Boom Boom rolled with laughter. But when he was through laughing, he decided the time had come to wake up poor Next Week. He crept very close to Next Week’s ear, took a deep breath, and then shouted: 'Now, Next Week!!!' Next Week woke up with a start and pulled his long Wank hard as he could. But his wank had been caught in the mashed potatoes which had frozen over during the night and as he pulled, it broke off: Whack! : Just like that. Next Week turned around to look at the Brew he had caught and instead saw his long lovely wank caught in the frozen potatoes.

<br/><br/>'Ohhh,' he moaned, 'ohhh, Basket Boom Boom. I will get you for this.' But Basket Boom Boom, even though he was laughing fit to kill was still faster than Next Week and he leaped aside and was gone.

<br/><br/>Next Week was so embarrassed, he went back to his car and did not come out until the on after. So it is that even to this day, 1 week later that Next Week has a short wank, Hates Rusty and his potatoes, and have no love at all for the Basket Boom Boom. And if you ever hear Next Week moaning, it is probably because he remembers the trick Basket Boom Boom played on him that Monday Night and he is mourning for his lost Wank.

On On,<br/>
