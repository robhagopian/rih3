color=#000000>“Bring Floaties!” said the hare. So a wide variety of dime-store 
plastic inflatables made their appearances, as the hashers pulled into the 
limited parking along Rt 3 just west of exit 6 (not 6a). The choices were 
obviously made with low cost being the primary goal. Most favored simple rings, 
and there was one rather unstable inflatable “jet-ski” brought by an optimistic 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT>. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Colin</FONT> and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Just Pat</FONT> brought small inflatable toy animals and 
water wings. Not a wise choice. I guess they’re hashers after all. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> brought <FONT color=#ff0000>Mrs. WIPOS</FONT> and a 
canoe. Don’t worry; <FONT color=#ff0000>Mrs. WIPOS</FONT> is the smart one. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> brought a life vest. Ha, ha!<?xml:namespace

color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> was coming with <FONT color=#ff0000>Snotty</FONT>, 
and had to be restrained from leaving early) they were off, floating downriver 
(north) on the Big River. The water was chilly, but tolerable (unless you were 
only made buoyant by water wings). (Or a life vest. Ha, ha!) “Trail” went under 
Rt 3 and then under the long and acoustically pleasing tunnels under Rt 95. But 
everyone was pretty well spread out, depending upon the choice of flotation, so 
there was no real singing. And <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>’s horn could be 
heard in the distance, so the paddling was furious.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finally, a mark was seen on the east side of the river, along with 
the hare. Getting out of the water gear, they took to the woods. There was a 
long false trail continuing north along the river. Virtually everyone fell for 
it, although <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
had to hide in the brush on the way back to allow <FONT color=#ff0000>Snotty 
</FONT>to savor the full experience of this <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT>-like trail. True trail went south. A check 
bushwhacked them uphill to another path, but it was pretty obvious that it would 
not make sense to stray too far from the river. Apart from <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>, most continued 
on, avoiding the unnecessary loop on the hill. They came back to 95 and 
predictably, waded across the river to the fishing lot and the beer stop, where 
the canoeists were waiting.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

annoying anecdotes endured, they packed up and carried their floaties southwest 
on Big River Road, crossed under Rt 95 and turned back on Rt 3 to the cars. They 
circled. Ratings for the run: no real exertion needed, a pleasant day for a 
float, and a few bimbos were positives. But the lack of drowning on trail as 
well as a fair amount of pavement were clear negatives. Total: +0. <FONT
