<p><font color="#008000">Run #957</font>, August 16, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; SESYB</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Freetown/Fall River State Forest</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 70’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Oozing SD, <font color="#0000FF">Late:</font> Basket Boom 
Boom, Seamus.  <font color="#0000FF">Gave up in Traffic:</font> Async, Tinker.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>An accident on 195 ensured a late start, and a poor showing. Newport County resident <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font> was first to arrive, and with the hare, sat alone in the deepening dusk at 6:30 at the Copicut Rd entrance 
to Fall River/Freetown State Forest. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>called in traffic reports and finally arrived, 
just in time to save the hare from succumbing to <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> charms (and skipping the run 
and opening the beer). <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was on his way. This made it clear that he wouldn’t be 
anywhere near the beer check that night!</p>

<p>They entered the woods at a record 6:55. Trail led southeast, then south. A check confused them briefly, but the 
sound of running water brought them downhill and west to a crossing of Rattlesnake River. They turned back south on the 
gas pipeline, avoiding mud in the tire ruts.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> avoided the mud so successfully that he 
avoided the trail altogether, and would still be heading south no doubt if the hare had not called him back. When there 
are only two hounds and a large cache of beer at the BC, one can afford to be charitable. Trail turned east and came to 
Daly path. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had an advantage at this point as the run turned into Run #910 in reverse, 
from fall, 2003.</p>

<p>Trail led east and south, with a few side excursions on the dirt bike single-track. They came south and then back 
slightly west to Ledge Road, where <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> explored a falsie into the stream that <font 
color="#FF0000">EB RIPTA</font> had so enjoyed the last time the hash was here. But the relentless <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> now knew that the beer had to be at the Old Quarry ledge, so he took off on Upper Ledge Road, turned back 
north on Pond Road, and hardly pausing to look for marks, climbed the boulder field on the south side of the ledge to 
the top and a very modest “B” on the rocks.</p>

<p>It didn’t do him much good though. The hare had hidden the beer so carefully, she had to call the two hashers to form 
a search party and comb the woods. Beer was finally found, with potato chips as well. They settled down to wait for<font 
color="#FF0000"> Basket,</font> until finally the hare realized she could call his cellphone. It was now 8 PM and well 
past sunset. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was reached at the start, and while <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> recommended that he go looking for trail northwards, the hare told him that he 
should wait for the sounds of whistles before blundering off into the woods. Yet another missed opportunity!</p>

<p>After a while, they turned back on dirt road northwest to the pipelines, then northeast without incident and without
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. They crossed the river again at a slightly different spot, and came out to the start 
to find <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> circling the cars.</p>

<p>They circled and ratings were good: some shiggy, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>, no<font color="#FF0000"> Fuwangi</font>, and a 33% on the bimbo scale (at least until the circle. This 
brings up a point: is it fair to rate a run when disaster occurs, but only in the circle? This could have been a 
near-perfect hash if <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>had not shown up. Where does one draw the line of misfortune? 
But I digress.): +6.9. Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>simply because he deserves it twice for 
the previous week’s efforts.</p>

<p>The On On On&nbsp; was at TKO’Malley’s in Fall River, a spot that has improved immeasurably with the new 
anti-smoking laws in Massachusetts. But they still only serve appetizers on Mondays, and were unaccountably unwilling 
to switch all the TVs to the Pakistani Men’s Field Hockey semis in the Olympics. They left around 11, secure in the 
knowledge that this trail can be reused again, at least one more time!</p>
