<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing SD</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Tucks, Cumberland</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 40's, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy, Amish It Head, Dr WHO, Just in My Ass, Bondo Jovi, Basket

<p>See if you can remember this. I certainly can’t. But fortunately, there are extensive notes taken on the occasion of 
this hash. These notes may be barely legible, scrawled with crayon on a piece of toilet paper with beer (?) stains on it. 
But that’s what we have. Given these caveats, this is a summary. Feel free to bombard the webmeister with elaborations, if 
you can remember that far back.</p>

<p>The group gathered outside Tucks, and at the appointed time were directed west into the woods. The way was mostly 
bushwhacking or deer paths. The checks all seemed to go left, and they curved southwest to a Quarry with dirtbike paths. 
Improbably enough, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led, as they now found trail east on a gas pipeline.</p>

<p>They entered a neighborhood. [The TP was torn here, so the details are a little fragmented.] They briefly went on some 
pavement, and then curved back northwest. Into the woods they ran, back west to a series of bushwhacks over some ridges, 
skirting the edge of a kettlehole pond. This lost some, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led now, turning downhill to 
Albion Rd. There, just across the School St bridge, was the hare’s car. The hare was not in evidence, but <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> tried across, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tried the old RR tracks, and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> waited for divine guidance. Finally someone noted a near invisible mark on the Albion Road side 
of the bridge. [The brown stains on the TP are much clearer.] <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was quick to turn into 
the woods along the northeast side of the Blackstone to the BC at the dam.</p>

<p>The dam was raging, and the noise drowned out the few attempts at song. But beer was enjoyed (unlike the rest of the 
run. No one fell into the sluice-way. [The TP is quite clear on this point.]  Seamus stayed up on the steep hill above the 
dam. Ben tried to knock anyone and everyone into the sluice-way. But all good things must end, and as they packed up and 
returned back to Albion, they ran into the lost and latecummers: <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.</p>

<p>This unfortunate turn of events spurred <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> to speed back, following the trail led northeast up Albion Road. They even indulged the hare 
to the extent that they turned into the brush, brambles and garbage marked by the hare behind one of the Mendon Road strip 
malls. Coming out in the rear parking lot, trail disappeared. [So did a piece of the TP, folded over and mysteriously 
stuck together with some viscous substance.] They ran up Mendon Rd. back to Tucks and the cars.</p>

<p>The circle was joined after the stragglers arrived. Ratings: no virgin territory, no bimbos, and prolonged pavement on 
the return were more than enough to offset the limited shiggy and scenic beer check. Total: <b>-6.9</b>. Hashit to <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, why? <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> doesn’t care! On On On was at… Tucks! [And that’s as 
far as the TP explains, before dissolving into a little brown stain.]</p>
