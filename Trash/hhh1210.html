felt safe enough to return, and go through some virgin parts of the relatively

embankment to a hidden trail and the first check. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> blew through a falsie, but found his own way back to 
the trail when he heard the horns heading east through a light swamp. Trail was 
mostly bushwhacking until a ancient and overgrown road was encountered and 
followed uphill and south towards some houses. A check sent <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> to visit the neighborhood. The rest found trail 
on a more well-used path skirting a steep hill overlooking the 
pond.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

by <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>? I think you can see the error pretty 
blatantly. But ultimately, true trail was found continuing south. Basket tried 
turning southwest across the dam, but stopped 6.9 feet before seeing the trail 
crossing which led to the beer check. The pack followed an increasingly 
overgrown path south, until a final check sent <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> back to investigate another neighborhood. The rest turned right and 
downhill to a stream.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

the banks made the stream the best choice. But<FONT color=#ff0000> WHO</FONT> 
makes good choices in the RIH3?Following <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>? I 
still&nbsp;can't get past that.&nbsp;The stream flowed out of a canyon, and once 
the sides were sufficiently steep, a check sent the pack up the southwest side 
to some more overgrown trails. A long, but well-marked bushwhack west brought 
them to the old electric trolley lines. Trail turned north. The lines were 
exceptionally satisfying. That is to say, they were filled with unavoidable mud. 
Which is really to say unavoidable if you didn’t notice the path running 
parallel on the far side. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> didn’t notice. 
Too bad. There was another neighborhood over there.</FONT></SPAN></P>

dam, then reversed itself just 6.9 feet from <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>’s 
last footprint, and circled the edge of the pond. They came to the beer check at 
a stone tunnel draining into the pond. There were three Cambodian fishermen on 
the roof of the tunnel, who were quite startled at first. The hare calmed them 
down with an explanation and a beer. The pack serenaded them, the recruitment 
efforts going into high gear. Right!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

returned to the start. They circled up on trail in. The ratings: good shiggy, 
good beer, several fish caught at the beer check (and no catch-and-release here. 
This was dinner!), and no pavement. But: no bimbos, <FONT

Just Josh was named “<FONT color=#ff0000>Dicks on Broadway</FONT>” after his

already had it anyways. Finishing up, they went to the Lodge. </FONT></SPAN>
