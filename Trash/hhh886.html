<p>Wolf Hill in Smithfield. Oh My Gosh! This place is like so romantic for me. It was here in Smithfield, where I first 
told the Hash that <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> and I were to be married. And <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>the 
hare, bless his soul, set trail in honor of our plighted troth (whatever that means) a mere 90 days later. O, three months 
ago how lost and yet how found I was when <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> led me from the woods, desperate and desolate 
in the deepening snow, by reminding me of my waiting <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>, and by grabbing me by my big …but I 
digress, lol. Any ways, back then we joined the group, and my news was received with congratulations and great rejoicing. 
Small wonder that I have agreed to write up yet another run that I missed. Luckily for me (and you all out there, you 
<font color="#FF0000"> KNO</font> who you are (tee-hee!)) the <font color="#FF0000">Raging Queen of Beer </font>agreed to 
help me with this write-up. How does he <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> so much? :-)</p>

<p>Well you <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>w, preparing for a wedding takes up a lot of a girl’s time. So I can’t always run with you guys. But anyways, I can sure tell you about it this time. The hare set trail from the Smithfield Ice Rink, 
hoping that no one would <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>tice that it was the same trail <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font> set a few months ago, from a different starting point. It was like he didn’t care that his bridesmaids were 
wearing last year’s styles! I mean come on! But anyways, the boys set off, stag again! You <font color="#FF0000">
KNO</font>w, anyone who didn’t <font color="#FF0000"> KNO</font>w them the way I <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>w them 
might think they were gay! Luckily I <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>w. <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> way!</p>

<p>The trail started out behind the rink by the Smithfield DPW salt storage shed. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> easily followed the trail out to the roads going north. Poor Dears! They had a lot of road 
ahead of them. I hope they don’t get stress fractures or anything that might keep them from dancing at my wedding! What a 
naughty hare!&nbsp; With all those lovely woods around! Anyways the hash spread out following flour and then curving around 
east past the Police Department. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> just knew that the lazy hare would use either the 
powerlines or the other trails on Wolf Hill, so he and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> went up into the woods. They 
ignored the hare’s frantic trumpeting and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> hooting, refusing to go back. So they missed 
the beer stop. Aging men alone in the woods. This reminds me. Which one of you guys is arranging <font color="#FF0000">
KNO’s</font> Bachelor Party? It had better be tasteful. Remember that he has a teenaged daughter. Maybe <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> should arrange it. He won’t have some young floozy jumping out of a cake or anything.</p>

<p>Well, back to my story. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS, Bondo</font> and the hare found the beer and enjoyed a few. 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> came to some trails that they followed back 
south along the reservoir. They found some flour and a few checks. But the flour disappeared after a check at a fork. One 
way went uphill to the powerlines. One way went down to the quarry, and that precious little waterfall that <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> had used for a beer check. In both directions they could see orange powder marks on the 
trees. It turned out that these were the marks left by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> that had survived the winter. 
I am glad too. I thought that shade of orange Kool-Aid mixed with flour was perfect for my bridesmaids’ dresses. I am 
going back out there with some swatches very soon. I just can’t wait to see the girls in these dresses. Kind of a backless 
low cut deal with some underwires up front and they all come with a matching thong monokini for the adventurous to 
show off at the reception. </p>

<p>I keep getting distracted. But who wouldn’t, with <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> breathing heavy on the nape of my 
neck. Let me get finished, sweetie, then I’ll put on the French maid’s costume for you. (Or is it a Freedom maid’s costume, 
now, I don’t <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>w!) Anyways, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> went uphill and downhill, back and forth, to and fro even. They had just about decided to go down to the 
waterfall when they heard a distant trumpet approaching. Finally <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> came down the path, beer in hand. They had an 
impromptu beer stop to allow <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and the hare time to make fun of the SC-ing FRB’s. And then 
off to the waterfall to finish off the beer. Now you <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>w a lot of Caribbean islands have 
really pretty waterfalls. <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> and I had thought about having our wedding in a natural pool by 
one of these waterfalls. You <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>w, like one of those shampoo commercials. But there were <font 
color="#FF0000">KNO</font> good ones in St Maarten, where we are going. (I just told <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> that
<font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>wing him, we really should be going to St JOHN THOMAS, if you <font color="#FF0000">KNO
</font>w what I mean lol.)</p>

<p>Well, OK. The boys had had their beer, so they jogged back to the Ice Rink without anything silly happening. They 
circled and rated the run. It got much better marks than it deserved really, total +0.69 mostly because <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr.WHO</font> got skunked at the first beer check. But&nbsp; come 
on! Positive marks without me or my <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> there? And <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>t even a 
Hoover or Swallow in sight? And <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> shiggy? But when the hare tried to make everyone sing a 
bunch of Billie Holiday songs rewritten as hash tunes, the hash responded appropriately, giving him the hashit. Now for me, 
I’m thinking “The Wedding Song” as we march up the aisle, “Feelings” as we leave the ceremony and a bunch of Donna Summer 
and BeeGees for the reception. Don’t worry, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. I won’t forget the “Electric Slide” and 
the “Chicken Dance” for you!</p>

<p>Where did they eat? Why Swampy’s, of course! They said the pickled eggs were off unfortunately. I heard that our hotel 
in the Caribbean has cajun pickled eggs, by the way. I have ordered 2000 of them for the reception, so you all better come 
hungry! But everything else was fine and another hash was over successfully, and now that I have written it up, we can put 
it to bed. Speaking of that, <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> has been a naughty boy, and I think I’ll just have to put him 
to bed too, right now. If only I can remember where I put that rectal thermometer.</p>
