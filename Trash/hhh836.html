<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Romantic Paddling with Bondo</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">Run: </font>#836 May 6, 2002<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Hare: </font><font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> &amp; <font color="#FF0000">Kneeling Room 
Only</font><br>
<font color="#0000ff">Where: </font>Charlestown<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Scribe:</font> Async<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Temp: </font>balmy, brisk, 40's<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Hounds: </font><font color="#FF0000">Async, Dr. Who, Bondo, Oozing</font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Latecummers:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Basket, WIPOS</font></font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Visitors:</font> 4 or 5 visitors whose names I can't remember, including, a couple of wankers 
from the Aquidneck Island Bowling Hash<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Supervisors:</font> Ben, Jake, Baxter<br><br>
<font color="#0000ff">The Run</font>:</p>

<p>Hare <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> thought she would be able to ditch most of us by setting her hash in the 
far reaches of South County.&nbsp; Except for perennial latecummers <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, most of the usual lowlifes navigated successfully thru the twisting roads of Charlestown.
&nbsp; But not <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.&nbsp; Woonsocket’s finest decided to turn LEFT when the directions 
said to turn RIGHT off of Route 1.&nbsp; After a half hour of cursing, chomped cigars and frenzied barking, the 
Bhottavista One found his way up the long driveway to the start of the run.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> managed to convince one of her (now former) friends to host the Rhode Island 
Hash at her lovely home in the woods.&nbsp; “<font color="#FF0000">Jo-Jo</font>” foolishly agreed to let the hash begin 
and end at her house.&nbsp; But more on the poor hostess later.</p>

<p>After a lame new boot orientation by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for the benefit of the visitors, the pack was 
off into the nearby trails.&nbsp; We followed the groomed trails through dense coastal scrub and trees.&nbsp; At the 
bottom of a short hill, the trail led to a small dam and a flour &quot;T&quot; on the trail.&nbsp; Nope, not T for 
Turkey, this was a Tequila check.&nbsp; The hares had thoughtfully placed a bottle of tequila and some fresh cut lime in 
observance of Cinco de Mayo.&nbsp; A calendar day late, but the pack didn't mind.&nbsp; They quickly passed the bottle 
around and got back on trail.&nbsp; A few minutes and a few falsies later, the trail led to the shore of a small pond.
&nbsp; The pack followed the hares around the shoreline to the beer check.&nbsp; Decent beer.&nbsp; No Bud.&nbsp; 
Guinness, that is.</p>

<p>At the beer check, we blew horns for the benefit of the latecumming <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS,</font> but they hadn't even bothered to set foot on trail.&nbsp; They hung out with Jo-Jo back at 
the start.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Jo-Jo</font> was apparently intrigued (or perhaps amused) by <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS'</font> sexy survival gear and <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> lab coat.</p>

<p>The pack, led by FRB <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,&nbsp; ran the quarter-mile or so back to the start.
&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> followed trail down to the pond 
behind <font color="#FF0000">Jo-Jo'</font>s house.&nbsp; At the edge of the pond there was a case of beer, a small dock 
and a half-swamped canoe.&nbsp; In spite of creeping dementia induced by far too many years of hashing, the two aging 
hash veterans were able to seize the opportunity.&nbsp; While the rest of the pack was back at the house 
flirting with <font color="#FF0000">Jo-Jo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> drained the canoe, grabbed the beer and paddled off into the sunset.</p>

<p>Eventually <font color="#FF0000">Jo-Jo</font> grew weary of the hash's antics.&nbsp; (<font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>evidently offered to model his kilt and fright wig for the young lady).&nbsp; The pack made its way 
down to the pond,&nbsp; discovered the beer was missing and began to cry.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had mercy on the wanks and paddled back to the shore and the circle.</p>

<p>The circle was held on the small slippery dock on a 45 degree slope.&nbsp; The back end of the dock was in the 
pond water.&nbsp; Religious Advisor <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom </font>led us through the usual 
ministrations, visitor down-downs and hashit award ceremony.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, 
the recipient of the coveted award, was less then gracious upon the completion of the voting.&nbsp; He insisted 
upon dancing with <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>on the slippery dock.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you might expect, the 
terrorists from Burrillville and Pakistan were soon in the water.</p>

<p>How did the Rhode Island Hash House Harriers show their gratitude to hostess <font color="#FF0000">Jo-Jo</font> for 
opening up her home to us?&nbsp; We &quot;Allouette=ed&quot; her, of course!&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Jo-Jo</font> 
showed her incredible agility and balance by teetering on to the sloping dock in spiked high heels, while <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>sang the respectful Allouette tribute to her.</p>

<p>An obvious glutton for punishment, <font color="#FF0000">Jo-Jo</font> invited us into her house for the on-on-on.
&nbsp; She had prepared a delicious vegetarian Mexican dinner.&nbsp; The pack was unusually quiet and well-behaved.
&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>kept his clothes on.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>didn't start 
any political discussions.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> didn't light any cigars.&nbsp; <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. Who </font>didn't tell any proctology jokes.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> didn't wax 
nostalgic about California.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> didn't stroke his cane.&nbsp; <font 
color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> didn't play pre-recorded hash songs.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Kneeling Room 
Only</font> didn't masturbate.</p>

<p>With any luck, we'll go back to a slimy bar next week.&nbsp; Good food and warm hospitality will spoil the hash.</p>
