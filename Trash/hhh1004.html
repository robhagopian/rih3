<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The start of this week’s run was off Rt. 112 at the northeast corner parking lot of the Carolina Management Area.  
As <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
were engaged in a pointless conversation over taxes, an unidentified car pulled in.  Not one, but two(!) virgins arrived, 
and bimbos on top of that!  <font color="#FF0000">Just Erin</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Jen</font> were 
finally coaxed into hashing by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>.  Actually, it was more accurately described as <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Jen</font> confessing “..after a year of daily harassment, I finally caved in and said, ‘ok, I’ll 
go, just stop pestering me…’”  Well, one must do what one must do to recruit new boots.  The arrival of <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> tarnished the 
otherwise nice pack of hounds.  After brief education of trail marks for the virgins, they were off, heading west into 
the Management area.</p>

<p>With the land largely excavated, it was pretty easy going at the start.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Erin</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Jen</font>, sticking closely together, didn’t think it was that bad after all.  Their 
impressions soon changed for the worse.  Hey, the hare didn’t mention anything about dead fish on trail!  A check was 
reached.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went north, the rest headed south, following the southern theme of the 
hash.  The piles of black sand were no doubt remnants of coal mining activity, a cultural cornerstone of Appalachia, and 
the western Carolinas.  This confused <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> into a falsie, with even more confused virgins 
following him.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> found true trail, heading out of the excavated fields of black coal 
dust piles and down some boulders into a dried up swamp, heading south, of course.</p>

<p>At this point, the hare pointed <font color="#FF0000">Just Jen</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Erin</font> into 
the swamp.  The price of losing their virginity was to be swift and dastardly this day!  <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> took turns breaking trail through the swamp (badly in need of water 
to really be considered a swamp, but I digress).  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, being the clever one, stayed close 
to and tried to charm the virgins.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was nowhere to be seen; however, nobody 
complained.  As the hashers skirted around the Hatchery Area, the fish were lucky not to have their waters defiled by 
RIH3, which would no doubt ruin the entire 2006 trout season.  There was the inevitable stream crossing, gratuitously 
offered by the hare.  At this point, the virgins gave up all hope of keeping their feet dry.</p>

<p>Trail bent westward out of the swamp.  A little actual running ensued, with <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> in the 
lead!  Hashing must have some kind of Fountain of Youth properties!  <font color="#FF0000">Just Erin</font> didn’t care 
if hashing turned sh*t into gold, as she only wanted to get out of the swamp.  Futilely trying to impress the virgins, 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> again took turns being the FRBs, as trail 
started to bend northward.  And then <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived from the opposite direction, as he somehow 
managed to run right past the beer check.  Skirting along a sandpit, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> were eventually greeted at the beer check by 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>.  
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> demonstrated that the best way to the 
beer is by arriving late.  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> again exhibited his blistering speed, as not even <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> saw him zoom right by him to the beer.  Either that or he was given secret instructions by 
the hare, but <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would do that?</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Just Jen</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Erin</font> arrived to a growing crowd followed 
by <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>.  Containers of IPA and porter were opened and the beer savored by all.  A bag of 
Carolina hot peanuts were welcomed too.  And being in the deep south, a bottle of Kentucky moonshine was passed around 
the group.  <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> had some water.  But where was 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>?  No <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>?  Ahhhhh… what a nice beer check!  However, 
hashers being hashers, they made some calls to bring <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to the beer check, against better 
judgment.  Even the virgins knew this to be a mistake.  The calls didn’t bring <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, but 
rather <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> to the beer check.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Jen</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Erin</font> were clearly impressed with <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS's</font> protective layers of 
kevlar.</p>

<p>Then a figure appeared from across a large field, but it didn’t look anything like <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
(not much does), and this hasher was running too!  Clue #2 that it wasn’t <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  It was 
<font color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font>, a transplanted hasher from Jhavalina H3 in Tucson, AZ.  The visitor was 
christened into RIH3 by being late (as RIH3 is probably the only hash chapter that ever starts on time) and covered 
in swamp shiggy and black dirt.  Nevertheless, <font color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font> was rewarded with beer, hot 
peanuts, and song.  Some thought they heard “asso” emanating from nearby woods, so everyone just gave up on <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  And the presence of four(!) bimbos inspired the typical wankers to be… well, typical 
wankers.  Another horrific attempt at making their rhubarb rise did nothing to impress the virgins and visitor.</p>

<p>After the beer check, the hare led the pack northward, while <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> ran east to the cars.  This proved to be a mistake as they were greeted by a 
smiling <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  The rest trickled in and the circle commenced.  Comments:  Four bimbos 
(Hooray!), two virgins (Hooray!), swamp shiggy (Hooray!), a visitor (Hooray!), a dead fish on trail (Hooray!), a boat on 
trail (Hooray!) no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> at the beer check (Hooray!).  Taking away from a strong effort by 
the hare were no loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, the hare still promised six virgins (but we’ll take any!), 
and the ease at which <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> found the beer.  
All in all, Total: <b>6.9!</b>  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> for his act of treason by 
co-haring for Newport.  In his defense, they did NOT go bowling.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Just Erin</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Jen</font> decided not to join the On-on-on.  
Nobody was certain, but some thought they heard something about picking up a friend at the airport.  No bets were made on 
their guaranteed return.  However, <font color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font> joined the rest of the wankers for beer 
and grub, which was at Mark’s (Exit 6 not 6A).  Exhausted from trying to entertain virgins, bimbos, and a visitor, 
the typically raucous bunch was uncharacteristically subdued.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> preferred to shoot pool.  And the hashers didn’t even bother to sing a single song for 
the entertainment of the other patrons.  All in all, yet another complete waste of an evening concluded.  You’d think 
they’d eventually learn.  Shees!</p>
