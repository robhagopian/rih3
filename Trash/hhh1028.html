<p><font color="#008000">Run #1028</font>, Dec 12, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Amish It Head</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Rome Point, North Kingston.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 30’s, Icy.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Tinker, Oozing SD, SESYB, Dry Foot Fairy, WIPOS, 
Seamus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>It’s been so long, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could remember any details about this run. But I promised a 
write-up and so here you are. We met at the parking lot for Rome Point in North Kingston, just South of Wickford. <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> expected to hash. So he made the trip from NH. Was he disappointed! I of course, knew 
exactly what to expect. But Trail wanted the bloody Steak Fry. So she made me come. (Ha, Ha!)</p>

<p>At six-thirty then, I led east out towards the point. The hare frantically called me back and showed me the most 
pathetic powder blue arrow. The marks were lightly tinted with Kool-Aid or something, and were almost impossible to see. 
Pathetic! He should try my technique of marking with garam masala! You can even smell the marks. Playing along, we turned 
right into a short bushwhack. At least this kept us off the sheer ice on the main road.</p>

<p>For a while. We were soon back on the road, and eventually came out on the old railroad grade. Some checks had us 
slipping and sliding every which way. But I of course was not fooled like <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, and followed true trail all the way. They headed off to Rome Point, while I led <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> north, following footprints more than flour. It must 
be my natural skills. After all, I once made it from Hyderabad to Lahore in less than a month on a lame water buffalo with 
no map, two gallons of muddy water from the Indus, and a pack of Cheetos!</p>

<p>The trail turned slightly west, and while I was looking after <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, they somehow got 
ahead of me. We were in some rolling woods, and ahead of me that annoying <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> removed a 
board bridge from a small thawing stream. I thoughtfully replaced it after I crossed. He is so childish! What a badmash! 
But we soon came to a “B”. The beer was hidden at an innocuous bend in the trail. Not very interesting. But there was 
beer. We sang and drank, and there were even some Cheetos!</p>

<p>Beer done, we reversed trail. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, again ahead of me, removed the bridge. It wasn’t 
funny the first time! But on we went, completing the anti-clockwise circle back to the cars. Only to find <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> slipping and sliding on the dirt road, trying to 
find trail. (You know, it’s not a bad idea: arrive late, look like you’ve exerted yourself, and have some beer. I may have 
to try this.) The circle was begun. Ratings for the run reflected lots of ice, invisible marks, and no pirate theme. The 
hare was given a <b>+0.69</b>! Hashit, I couldn’t tell you. It must have gone to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.</p>

<p>Finally, we moved on. We made it to the Oak Hill Tavern for the first time in a while, and they were ready for us (or 
at least had enough food, this time. But no chapattis. Or Cheetos!) The steaks were cooked, the beer contaminated, popcorn 
was spilled, and songs were sung. Another wasted evening! I think I’ll spend a few extra weeks in Scotland over the 
holidays!</p>
