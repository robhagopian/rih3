<p>The RIH3 was blessed with yet another outstanding run through virgin territory. The hare’s d’erections were to park 
at a White Pine grove, just after mailbox #170 on the side of Henry Brown Road in West Greenwich. Just before the 
tree farm. Unfortunately, no one in the RIH3 can tell the difference between a pine tree and a rhododendron. And no one 
is all that good with numbers, either. There was some confusion at first. But nevertheless, a reasonable crowd gathered 
in time to set out at 6:30 promptly.</p>

<p>Trail briefly went east on the road, and came to a check. They found a woods trail doubling back northwest into 
the White Pine grove, and a swampy area with a maze of trails. After a brief but gratifying bit of confusion, an old 
logging road was found. There were boards, mostly White Pine. They turned north, led by <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>. The Fisherville Brook, more like a swamp in this area, was encountered for the first time. With the 
recent rains, staying dry footed (like a fairy) was not an option. Most ended up in some puddles in the road as well 
as crossing the shallow river itself in two areas. This would not be the last time the trail encountered this brook. 
But it would be the last of the White Pines.</p>

<p>As they turned east, they encountered another check. The predominant tree here was Red Maple. <font color="#FF0000">
Dry Foot Fairy, SESYB, Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> continued on true trail east, 
while <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>tried a short-cut north. If they had 
had the courage of their convictions, they would have found trail some 200 yds uphill. But being who they are, they 
wandered around aimlessly. Eventually, they came upon the others who were on trail. Except <font color="#FF0000">
SESYB</font>, who was bushwhacking towards any light she could see. She kept running into Silver Birches. Mostly 
together, they turned north uphill.</p>

<p>There were a few more checks to come.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>grew bored of this, and took off on a 
path north on the east side of the brook. He would not be seen for sometime. But he found some Larches. The rest 
crossed west over the brook again, and came uphill to a five-way check, with all trails having at least two marks. 
There were lots of Blue Spruces here, perhaps because of the altitude gain. The hare was tired so he was not giving 
any clues. They ran back and forth through the trails, making a lot of noise, but not getting anywhere, Finally, as 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> arrived, the hare realized that <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was still 
not present. He quickly showed them the proper trail turning southwest. They continued more or less as a group, and 
blew past a giant arrow directing them into a bushwhack. The hare waited patiently. They came back sheepishly.</p>

<p>The bushwhack headed west, into a swampy area and yet another stream crossing which led to a trail. Mixed, new 
growth Beech and Swamp Maple were here. Led by <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>, they continued west to encounter: <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, fresh from recent penile 
enhancement surgery and ready to go. He had come in backwards (with some advice from his surgeon <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> didn’t want him to bust his stitches trying to keep up with these “athletes”). They gathered 
at a check which had been confusing him, and eventually found the overgrown path diagonally to the right that led 
back to true trail.</p>

<p>Continuing mostly west, they came to a bushwhack along the border of a shooting range. Regrettably, there was 
no nocturnal activity. But there were Pitch Pine and Pepperberry Bushes. Following the marks led through another swamp 
and to a trail heading south. After mastering several checks, they found themselves bushwhacking again, this time 
towards a foul-smelling presence with a light and a horn. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was back. The hare 
was crushed. To make matters worse, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> now found the lead which led southwest down 
to another stream crossing and the Beer Check. A near perfect run, ruined by wild random chance!</p>

<p>All were present then, at the beer check. Perfect Porter and 60 minute IPA were served with spicy peanuts. More 
Red Maples formed their shelter. A few songs were performed. But with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> both there, their hearts weren’t in it. So, they packed up and the hare offered <font 
color="#FF0000">Async’s</font> shortcut to those who wanted it, while he, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and the<font color="#FF0000"> Fairy</font> followed true trail through, along 
and crossing the brook several more times. A few Oaks and dense Bog Leatherleaf. The others were shepherded back to 
<font color="#FF0000">Async’s </font>car and driven back to the start, about a half-mile east on Henry Brown Road.</p>

<p>Now <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker </font>up to this point had shown generally good judgment (apart from 
showing up in the first place). She avoided <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. She did not follow <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. She drives a new Mercedes with an electronic key, so she had left her key in the 
hare’s trunk, figuring this might be a wet run. So before the circle, she retrieved her key from the hare, and 
after changing, placed it in her own trunk. The circle was begun in the White Pine grove, 30 yds off the street.</p>

<p>The circle didn’t get very far however, because a vehicle with a searchlight drove by repeatedly, scanning the 
woods and ultimately shouting something like: “Get the F@&amp;% out of there!” A brief period of indecision colored 
by recent experiences in Woonsocket was followed by a hasty general retreat from the woods. They came back out to the 
cars, with the mysterious searchlight no where to be seen. An interesting fact was discovered. You can’t open the 
trunk of a Mercedes without a key in the ignition. [Note: you can’t open the trunk of a tree without a chainsaw.]</p>

<p>A quick call was made to Mercedes. They suggested that they could come tow the car away, and replace the locks. 
Sometime this week. <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> noted that her extra key was in her apartment. In 
Groton, CT. Locked in, of course. Where were her apartment keys? In the trunk. Everyone suddenly started to look busy 
or preoccupied. But finally, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> agreed to drive her to Groton, break into 
her apartment, drive her back, and front her some cash. Possibly, he sensed an opportunity. There are some fine trees 
in Groton.</p>

<p>After waving them off, the rest got changed and drove out to exit 6, not 6A where they settled in, only to be 
joined by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. He had not seen any trees at all. The circle was finished in Mark's 
Grille, and they had the usual fare, placing bets on which bed would be visited by a Fairy that night. It just shows 
that the best laid plans of mice and hashers get really screwed when you start driving around in German cars. Or trees, 
for that matter.</p>
