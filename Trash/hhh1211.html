color=#000000>The start for this one was from the middle of nowhere, South 
Kingston, next to the Acela tracks, next to a junkyard of old trucks, and across 
the tracks (and two fences) from what appeared to be some very nice trails. It 
was just north of URI, so <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> couldn’t show, 
given what he owes on his library books. But a surprisingly large crowd managed 
to squeeze their vehicles into the dirt road at the end of Stony Fort Road by 
6:30, including the long time backslider <FONT color=#ff0000>Cumsocket To 
Me</FONT>.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

color=#000000>Trail started out east, crossed the road and went straight into 
shiggy. Nice! It turned southeast, and then back east on some trails finally. 
There were a few good checks. By this I mean they were not <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> checks with 50 marks leading to a false. There was a 
long loop east to the Old North Road, which had <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket 
</FONT>running up and down the road, while <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Spencer</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> looked skeptically on, and the 
rest, led by <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just

color=#000000>Trail now headed south. It eventually looped back north and then 
west to a feint near some URI parking areas. True trail led north to the beer 
check. Amazingly, all the hashers made it in, and the beer was found rather 
quickly for a <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> run. Songs, beer, etc., etc., 
yada, yada, yada. And then they were off, west to some 
fields.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail led out to the road, but there was considerable 
disorientation. The first impulse (to turn south) was wrong. It only took a half 
mile to convince the pack of this. They turned back north to the cars. The 
circle was formed. The run was rated. Bimbos, backsliders, beer and briars. And 
no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. Total +6.9! The backslider was punished. 
Yet again the dreaded “Tonga(?)” song came out. Hashit was given to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>. Don’t even ask. <o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finishing up, the hare informed them that the On On On was to be 
at Ocean Mist, in Matunuck! More miles south before we could lay our weary heads 
to rest! Attempts at protest drew snarls and growls of a most vicious nature 
from the hare. The angry, angry hare! So those that could not think quickly 
enough to excuse themselves to pick up a friend at the airport were forced to 
drive yet further south, eat mediocre food and questionable beer at a poorly 
cleaned table, and watch Oozing get picked up by a sixty-ish woman with fake 
boobs and body odor. Home for most, would wait until 1 AM. We’re getting too old 
for this.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
