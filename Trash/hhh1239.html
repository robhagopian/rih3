than your current scribe has managed. This is what happens when you try to rely 
on <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. And, by the way, if any of you other 
wankers feel the creative urge to write one of these babies up, feel free to. 
Email it to me, and I’ll even load it for you. And <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, this is only a short version. Feel free to 
embellish.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

color=#000000>Starting from the parking lot on Pound Hill, just off 146 on an 
unseemly warm Sunday at 2 PM, it looked like it was going to be a more typical 
RIH3 outing. By that I mean no bimbos! But at least <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> was absent. Trail led from the back parking lot down 
a snow/mud embankment, into some shiggy. The hare was live-setting. There must 
have been a gay soccer match on, somewhere in the world, that morning.

color=#000000>Trail bushwhacked its way towards 146. The “Halloween” trail was 
reached, and the marks disappeared. The lead pack of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>CEP</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Rusty</FONT> finally found true trail, heading back west to 
Industrial Drive. They also apparently found that the hare had been setting off 
alarms at a commercial building across the way. The police had discovered him. 
Unfortunately, they did not shoot him on sight. But there was no Beer Check!

color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> had been 
exploring the marshes east of the Homestead Gardens. Arriving finally on 
Industrial too late for these insights, they saw the lead pack heading southeast 
on the road. Like lambs to the slaughter, they followed. A true trail arrow led 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> into 
some shiggy, but it was a blatant lie. They finally joined the rest, who along 
with late-cummers <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Mr Rogers</FONT>, 
were gathering behind the indoor sports complex. A sad and pathetic BC was 
held.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The circle, of course, took place at Basket’s. The run received 
ratings that were well deserved. So much for the Christmas spirit. Total:-6.9! 
Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. A feast was held with many 
presents, and a fine movie viewing. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> can fill 
you in on the details; I’ve got more important things to
