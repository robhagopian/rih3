remembers exactly how this hash went. But WHO doesn’t. All I can remember is 
that the hare decided to make it a bike hash. WHO was stupid enough to bring a 
bike? No, WHO wasn’t. Rather than try to recreate the actual run at this late 
date, I’ll provide a visual clue for those that weren’t there (the lucky ones.)<o:p></O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The picture shows 
the area in question. The Black trails were used by the bikers (the hare, 
Basket, Bondo, and Flobanger.) The red trails were explored by the rest. There 
was a beer check, but where, I haven’t a clue. This is what comes of delaying 
write-ups for so many months. If the write-up has any detail, it must have been 
a good hash. If the write-up sucks, and fills up paragraphs with stupid 
pictures, maps, and no detail whatsoever, the hash must have sucked. This in 
reality, is a pretty good system.<BR>

color=#000000>Running instead of biking on a bike hash is fraught with danger. 
The run could be a mini-marathon. There could be miles of pavement. The shiggy, 
if any, will be minimal. Short-cutting is a necessity for the runners, but could 
be impossible. If any of these had happened on this run, WHO would have 
remembered. So, there you have it. The run sucked. -6.9! Basket was hashit. JC’s 
(formerly Rosies, formerly Marks) was the final destination. Thank you for your 
attention.<o:p></O:P></FONT></SPAN></P>
