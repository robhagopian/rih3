<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Most hashers in 
Rhode Island know Ryan Park pretty well. And most recognize that there are 
several entrances to the park. Luckily, the hares’ d’erections couldn’t have 
been more clear without GPS coordinates. The hares were a bit disappointed in 
the turn out, as only five old timers showed up at the start. And that included 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! What an 
awful start! But 6:30 arrived, and they were off.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">From the parking 
area (0.2 MILES DOWN OAKHILL ROAD FROM RT 4, <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, 
this means YOU!), trail turned west on Oakhill Rd. A check and the hare had 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> turning 
south on the powerlines. Falsie! Cute! <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> turned north, on true trail. The powerlines 
were followed briefly. A loop west into the woods, a re-crossing east to the 
fields of Ryan Park proper and creative re-markings by the hares had everyone 
pretty confused. Half the pack headed north towards Lafayette Rd. Half turned 
towards Belleville Pond. All were wrong. But when they returned, they found 
suspiciously fresh new marks directing them west. Even <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> caught on, and they found true trail leading to a 
spot overlooking Rt4. It was the beer stop!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Running in the 
dark is hard. It gets scary out there. You might get lost, and be alone. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> might find you alone! So a brief trail to a beer stop 
is always welcome. The beer was opened, and enjoyed. A few songs were sung. But 
then…what could it mean? A light… no, two lights… no, three lights… no, EIGHT 
lights! The group dowsed their lights and tried to drink quickly. Too late! 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> led <FONT color=#ff0000>Just MJ</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Kathy</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Pat my Fly</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Nathaniel</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT> to 
the beer check. This group of rocket scientists had parked in the main lot (MORE 
THAN ONE MILE DOWN OAKHILL RD FROM RT 4, <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, this 
still means YOU!) and assumed that this was the start, despite the lack of 
hares, hashers, etc. Brilliant!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">There was still 
enough beer left (we’re slipping) to give the latecummers 0.69 beers each. As 
they drank, the songs came out in earnest, along with considerable mockery 
directed towards <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. Finishing up, the hares were 
somewhat vague about trail back. Marks were found in the woods paralleling Rt 4 
south. But after a while this grew dull. Most returned to the powerlines, just 
long enough to find a trail that took them back to the Ryan Park trails and the 
cars. Most, that is. But not <FONT color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT>. He could get 
lost in a one-lane tunnel.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The circle was 
joined. The ratings were started (and briefly delayed when <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT> finally made his reappearance, aided mostly by 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT> horn). No pavement, 
idiots-that-can’t-follow-simple-d’erections on trail, multiple bimbos, and a 
short trail were positives. But, no one lost, <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> at the beer check, and lack of shiggy took 
their toll. Total:-0.69. The visitors were brought in, and punished. It was 
pointed out that <FONT color=#ff0000>Pat My Fly</FONT> had no RI name. So he was 
named. “<FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT>.” So right on so many levels! Hashit 
was given to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, of course, for indiscriminate 
use of bugle. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Finishing up, 
they swung low. The knuckleheaded ones&nbsp;were ferried back to their cars, and 
the whole group reconvened at the Oakhill Tavern, for yet another steak fry, 
more peanuts and popcorn in the beer, and more behavior which frankly is damned 
immature for a bunch with an average age almost 50. For cryin’ out 
loud!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
