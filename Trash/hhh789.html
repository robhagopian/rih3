<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was billed &quot;the Revenge of the Snotty
One&quot; but it was wetter than anyones snot that I know of.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was a balmy 80 degrees plus and humid, as the
pack gathered on time and waited for yours truly to arrive, and the pack was
off.</font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"> Brief d'erections were given to
the virgin who claimed she had no change in clothing as I thought well, last
time we see her!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> ran off
like a gazelle towards the reservoir (obviously kept in shape and with a shapely
wife as his so would (wood?) I!)&nbsp; I was handed a flimsy floater so we were
obviously going to get we...ooops! Trail led across the reservoir and<font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> swam across like eels and
were off not to be seen again for a very long time. The ladies, <font color="#FF0000">Wipos</font>,
<font color="#FF0000">PW</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> swam
across while a rope was tied around my waist and <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font>
swam across and dragged me across...I let my life in the hands of these wanks?
Whats wrong with me? <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>was also nowhere and
presumably taken a short cut to the BC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Across and dripping, we found trail and to a
check that led us up a dry, sandy hill southwards (who the fuck knows what
direction!) to a few more checks that were easily negotiated to an arrow that
led us straight into a stinkin', leech-infested swamp! Initially the braves took
steps on tree stumps to avoid getting wet but soon we were waist deep in the
thickest shiggy RIH3 has ran in this millenium (stay home Snotty!). <font color="#FF0000">Just
Tara </font>was quite sure she was not going to return at this point! Out of the
swamp and barely shaken off the leeches the pack was confronted by another
insecure, territorial neighbour, whom <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>took
care of (it must have been the smell).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Hitting a dirt trail and thru a few more
checks unto the BC, beer was consumed as the mosquitoes consumed our
blood!&nbsp; Songs were sung and maybe Tara was contemplating a return as she
heard the sweet-soul stirring voices of the rhody-hash (minus <font color="#FF0000">Bondo,
PW, ShineOn, Async, Hopeless </font>and still no <font color="#FF0000">Tinker!</font>)
A pint less of our blood we took off northwards towards...another water
crossing! This one was welcomed tho' as we were glad to wash ourselves off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Once again oozing was roped across by the
Brit (they never really wanted to let go of the sub-continent either!). Basket
threw the beer across that smashed into the water and leaked to the glee of the
fish. A fishing family looked on in wonderment and vowed never to fish there
again! The rest of the pack joined us as we ran up down the road, laddie! back
to the start.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A quick washdown in the reservoir before the pack
headed back to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> house for the ONON. The
circle up was in the pool and the yin and yang of the RIH3 was appreciated by,
well, no one really: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> jumped in naked save
the hashit (toilet seat tied to his bum), and WIPOS with all his clothes AND his
shoes on.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Just Tara</font> was definitely coming
back!&nbsp; Down down to the hares with <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font>
translating both for the hare and Oozing.&nbsp; Also down downs to the Hashit (<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>),
returnees and the virgins. Good food was consumed straight off the grill as the
pack basked in the starlit night. T-shirts were distributed for a nominal fee,
or a sexual favour for <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font>
was proud to have infested the whole of Glendale with foot/mouth disease and
threatened to return soon as <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> vowed never
to return but I have a feeling he will be back before <font color="#FF0000">Just
Tara</font>... More good beer and songs and a great time was had by all!&nbsp;</font></p>
