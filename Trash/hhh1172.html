style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The start of 
this hash was from the Johnston Home Depot, off Atwood Ave, not Atwells Ave. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> could confuse those two. The group was on the 
small side, recovering perhaps from the Mews Canoe event the day before. But, 
word was that <FONT color=#ff0000>Scatwoman</FONT> would finally make her 
re-appearance after a summer of loneliness down in DC. Too bad she listened to 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, and found a Home Depot near 
Atwells.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The start, of 
course, was uphill, heading west. A quick check led to the powerlines, and up 
and over they went, led by <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> decided early on to try his luck in the woods, drawn 
by the giant “HH” clearly seen in the woods on the satellite photo. The lead 
pack came down the powerlines. There was only one real choice: to bushwhack to a 
previously used hole in the fence by Central Ave, and to cross under 295 to the 
north-south continuation of the powerlines. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket 
</FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> led and soon caught up with the 
hare. <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> decided to try their luck in a drainage pipe which crossed back 
under 295. They didn’t get far.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Meanwhile, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Scatwoman</FONT> had apparently arrived. After two marks, she gave 
up in disgust, and vowed to never hash again. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> 
was wandering around on Rt 6. The rest of the group followed the hare to the 
beer stop, overlooking the 295-6 interchange. As they started their beer, they 
saw <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> below. Unfortunately, he saw them too, and 
joined the group. <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT> finally made it in, 
whining about his knee brace slowing him down.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">It was getting 
dark, so as soon as the beer was gone, <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> took off. Trail continued down the powerlines, 
and then turned right on a dirt road under 295, to the Rt 6 on-ramp. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> managed to pull a muscle in his leg, so <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> continued on, 
finding trail re-entering the woods on a bushwhack parallel to Rt 6. This led 
uphill, and was lost near the top. However, after a brief encounter with some 
briars, the group came out on the dirt-bike paths above the Home Depot. They 
returned to the cars. <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT> stuck 
with the hare. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> was limping along, somewhere in 
the rear.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">While the group 
carried a cooler from the cars up the hill a ways, <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish 
</FONT>drove back to get <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>. Guess who (not <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>) got Hashit? The run was rated. No virgin territory, no 
use of drain pipes, loss of a bimbo even before the start, and too much 
pavement. Of course, <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> was injured. And, there 
was NO SIGN of <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! Total: +0.69! The visitor was 
punished, <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> took his Hashit, and the circle was 
ended. The On On On was at Sparxx on Rt 5. Where they ate outside and were 
joined by <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Katie</FONT>. Not too bad a way to end a 
hash.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
