at a parking lot at the end of an unmarked dirt road off Buck Hill Rd in 
Burrillville. Somehow, the above were able to find it fairly easily, but it did 
keep those annoying visitors from Boston away at least. Trail started north on 
the Benson Mountain Trail. Soon, the pack checked left and came out onto one of 
those fields which have been visited by the hash so many times. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> were convinced 
they knew where the trail was headed. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> predicted 
the Tri-State marker. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> favored Wallum Lake. 
They were both wrong. <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> was wrong also,&nbsp;as a 
matter of&nbsp;principal.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNoSpacing><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Trail meandered 
generally north, with a few needless loops through various fields. The bugs were 
out in force, almost making up for the lack of shiggy. A check had <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> following the CT Border Trail north. The rest turned 
east on true trail. They looped around north of Buck Hill Pond, missing some 
good swamps and a chance to get wet. It seemed as though they were going for the 
lake when… they found the beer check! It was a nondescript spot, next to an old 
house foundation. But at least it was beer. And it gave the pursuing mosquitoes 
a chance to catch their breath.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

finishing off the limited supplies of brew and listening to a few stories of 
sex-on-trail from the hare, they headed back, completing the loop south to the 
Benson Mt Trail, and the cars. The run was rated: lack of shiggy, no one lost, 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> on trail far outweighed the presence of 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Just Katie</FONT> on trail. Total: -0.69. Hashit went from 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> to <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> again. The reasons were just, if a bit 
incomprehensible. They finished up and decided where to go. Rather than ruining 
the night of a few dozen residents of Pascoag, they decided to descend upon 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Dogmeat</FONT> and order pizza at Snake Hill Road. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> had beer. Enough said!</SPAN></P>
