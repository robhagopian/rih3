<BR><font color="#3366FF">The Pack:</font>

Boom<BR>Oozing Syphilitic Dick-Ta-Phone<BR>Kamanawannaleia (NH3)<BR>Hurling Dick 
(NH3)<BR>Spank Me (NH3)</font><BR><BR><BR>It was a dark and stormless night.  The pack 
gathered at the appointed<BR>hour, fleece-wrapped and champing at the bit to be 
unleashed on the<BR>strapless hapless hare.  The Newport Hash House Harriers 
contingent was<BR>particularly anxious to get a move on after suffering the long 
ride from<BR>the island.  And without delay, it was on-on.<BR><BR>Harriette <font color="#FF0000"> 
Cheap Licker</font> led the pack down the road and between a couple<BR>houses.  And 
that was the last the pack saw of pavement and civilization<BR><BR>on this run.  
The dark and dreary forest consumed the pack like Jake<BR>consumes his master’s 
backwash.<BR><BR><font color="#FF0000">Spank Me</font> set off solo at the first check.  His ill-fated jaunt 
put him<BR>deeper into the abyss of North Kingstown and beyond sight of the 
pack’s<BR>D-cell torches.  Alone and scared, he about-faced and high-tailed 
back<BR>to the check, chanting to himself, “Lions and tigers and bears.  
Oh,<BR>my!”  He headed outbound on the only other apparent trail and, much 
to<BR>his relief, soon heard the baying of the hounds.  All that now 
separated<BR>him from the pack was an acre of forest and enough new growth 
shiggy to<BR>bleed a hasher dry.  He rendezvoused with the others as the pack 
emerged<BR>from the woods...and found another check.<BR><BR><font color="#FF0000">Spank Me</font> did a 
right turnout to parallel the highway, solo again.<BR>Others went left up the 
side of the highway.  Still others milled about<BR>smartly, conserving energy 
and precious sweat, waiting to learn of true<BR>trail from the check.  The 
left-goers’ intuition was on, putting them<BR>on-on.  Meanwhile, beyond range of 
their shouts and horn blows, <font color="#FF0000"> Spank Me</font><BR>nearly crossed into another state 
before giving up on finding trail in<BR>that direction.  He double-timed back to 
the check from where he spied<BR>eight hashers above him, running along a 
ridgeline that paralleled the<BR>highway.  He followed in their direction of 
advance, staying down by the<BR>highway until <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, in the lead, 
darted into the woods.<BR><font color="#FF0000">Spank Me</font> scampered up the 30-degree incline of loose 
dirt and scrub<BR>shrubbery to join in the search for trail.<BR><BR>Mag-Lights 
were turned off at this point.  The pack turned to their<BR>sense of hearing to 
follow FRB <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing’s</font> near constant shouts of,<BR>“Whatthefuck?  There’s no flour 
on this trail!”  <font color="#FF0000">Cheap</font>, accompanying the<BR>pack, played dumb as the pack 
wandered about the ridgeline, poking into<BR>the woods now and then in hope of 
finding trail.  “There!” shouted<BR><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. “I think…  Is it?”  
<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> knelt 
next to the smidgen of white,<BR>powdery substance.  “Doesn’t taste like 
bird shit.  I think we’ve found<BR>trail,” he proclaimed.  And there was much 
rejoicing…until the cops<BR>showed up.<BR><BR>Twenty feet below, in the 
breakdown lane of the highway, was one of<BR>Rhode Island’s finest in his 
trooper car, cherries on.  We strained to<BR>see whether he had made a stop or 
was interested in us.  A mile-long<BR>Mag-Light pointed up at us gave us the 
answer.  The nervous pack quickly<BR>discussed strategy.  “Let’s tell him 
we’re a drink—I mean, running<BR>club,” offered <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. “I think we could 
overpower him,” chimed in<BR><font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. “Fuck!” said
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"> Spank Me</font> threw in, 
“Why not say we’re just<BR>a bunch of guys reclaiming our masculinity by beating 
our drums…er,<BR>blowing our horns and whistles?”  “What about <font color="#FF0000"> Cheap</font> here?” 
challenged<BR><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. “Say we rented her for the night,” said another .  But it 
was<BR><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>’s plan that prevailed.  “I’m going down there and explain to 
the<BR>trooper that we’re a harmless group of runners who wear 
silly-looking<BR>hats like this one,” he said, puffing out his chest.  And down 
went<BR>RIH3’s diplomat.<BR><BR>Not one but two troopers met <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. The first 
guy must have called for<BR>backup upon seeing <font color="#FF0000"> Basket </font> clamor down the hill, 
adorned in his<BR>Russian-like faux fur hat with a RIH3 patch proudly centered 
on the<BR>front.  And just to add difficulty to <font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font>’s painfully slow 
progress<BR>of cumming down the embankment, one of the troopers focused the 
beam<BR>from his Mag-Light on <font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font>’s face, momentarily stunning
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. 
He<BR>stood frozen in place, looking much like Dan Quayle.  Blinded and 
with<BR>arms reached out like a zombie from “Night of the Walking Dead”, <font color="#FF0000"> 
Basket</font><BR>managed to reach the troopers, now with their sidearms unlocked 
from<BR>their holsters.  “I am <font color="#FF0000"> Basket Boom Boom</font> of the Rhode Island Hash 
House<BR>Harriers,” <font color="#FF0000"> Basket </font> announced.  The rest of the pack gathered 
behind<BR><font color="#FF0000">Basket </font> to listen to the troopers tag team him with probing 
questions.<BR>“Name, address and telephone number,” demanded one.  “What’s the 
name of<BR>that pond in Glendale?” asked the other, hoping to throw <font color="#FF0000"> Basket
</font> 
off<BR>balance.  But the good <font color="#FF0000"> Basket </font> kept his cool, answering their 
questions<BR>with questions, taking the high ground.  “Why, which pond would you 
be<BR>referring to, Officer?” countered <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. The troopers 
retreated,<BR>satisfied with Basket’s explanation that this was an 
Adopt-A-Highway<BR>group out doing its monthly cleaning of that stretch of 
the<BR>highway…hours after sundown.  But as the pack turned its attention 
back<BR>to finding trail, <font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> remained at attention, his eyes focused 
on<BR>infinity and his mind on another time, another life.  His 
nostrils<BR>flared to take in the heavy, humid air of Southeast Asia.  The 
sounds of<BR>Huey gunships, the barked commands of a Marine sergeant, 
dogtags<BR>plastered to his sweaty, still hairless chest…it was all coming back 
to<BR>him.   “Matsinger, William J., lance corporal, United States 
Marine<BR>Corps, serial number….” He muttered.<BR><BR>Newly on the scene was 
Newport HHH’s <font color="#FF0000"> Hurling Dick</font>. “What up?” he asked<BR>as the pack regrouped.  And 
the run continued.<BR><BR>Oozing had found the beer check stash just as the 
first trooper arrived<BR>on the scene.  Now he led the pack into the safety of 
the woods, where<BR>it could enjoy the liquid refreshment.  On a calm winter’s 
night in<BR>Rhode Island, hare and hounds shared a lair and sustenance.  <font color="#FF0000"> 
Cheap</font><BR>helped <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font> off with the rucksack that contained the beer 
check<BR>supplies:  ample servings of Tetley’s and Bass, as well as piping 
hot<BR>Irish cwoffee.  And there was much rejoicing.<BR>From there the 
hare led the pack through ankle-deep water and back into<BR>the woods.  At a 
check, <font color="#FF0000">Spank Me</font> struck out in a direction to his<BR>liking, this time with 
others in trail.  Much to his surprise, he found<BR>himself on true trail.  He 
followed the dirt drive uphill and through<BR>secluded, posh, private property.  
Missing a check, he wandered deeply<BR>off trail until experience told him he’d 
gone way too far.  He<BR>backtracked until discovering the check and stumbled 
his way back to the<BR>pack, which was just sitting down to its second beer 
stop.<BR><BR>Niggardly with flour, <font color="#FF0000"> Cheap</font> was anything but stingy with her 
beer<BR>selection on this run.  Shipyard and Double Diamond were the 
tasty<BR>treats on this stop.  The hare and hounds sat on a felled tree under 
a<BR>clear sky and enjoyed tales of hashes past, funny happenings on 
this<BR>one, and witnessed Jake topple <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font> from his perch and proceed 
to<BR>mount his Pakistani play thing.  Struggling under the weight of 
a<BR>hundred pounds of determined Lab, it took <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font> nearly a minute to 
free<BR>himself.  Too bad there was no bonfire for the two to light 
post-coital<BR>cigarettes, although <font color="#FF0000"> Cheap Licker</font> had staged wood for such a fire 
at the<BR>beer stop site.<BR><BR>Chilled from their own sweat and the sight 
of the crazed, neutered Jake<BR>having his way with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, the pack humped it 
(sorry, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>) out of<BR>the woods to where <font color="#FF0000"> Cheap</font>’s Honda awaited. <font color="#FF0000"> Hurl
</font> and <font color="#FF0000"> 
Basket </font> debated<BR>whether to apply LIFO and FIFO in determining who was to be 
among the<BR>first to get a ride back to their cars.  It worked out that <font color="#FF0000"> 
Cheap</font><BR>shuttled a select few and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000"> Hurl, Oozing, Spank Me
</font> and the 
dogs<BR>were left alongside the road and directed to guard what remained of 
the<BR>12-pack of Shipyard and await extraction.  And there was much 
rejoicing<BR>and shivering.<BR><BR>Predictably, the on-in was held at Chez 
Cheap.  After the dallying duo<BR>of <font color="#FF0000"> Kamana </font> and <font color="#FF0000"> Spank Me</font> showed up, the circle 
was called.  <font color="#FF0000"> Cheap </font> drank as<BR>hare.  <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font> was presented the hashit and 
did the accompanying<BR>down-down.  <font color="#FF0000"> Hurl d</font>rank for being a late-cummer.  After a 
most<BR>heart-warming rendition of “Swing Low” was sung and the circle 
closed,<BR>the ravenous lot made for the kitchen, where warm deep-dish 
lasagna,<BR>garlic bread and salad awaited.  As expected, the food was delicious 
and<BR>in grand quantity.  What’s more, the beer selection was far 
above<BR>average, even by RIH3 standards, including one of <font color="#FF0000"> Spank Me</font>’s 
favorites,<BR>McEwan’s Scotch Ale.<BR>
