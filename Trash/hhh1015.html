<p><font color="#008000">Run #1015</font>, September 12, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Async</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Thompson, CT (Quaddick Reservoir)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 80 and extremely humid</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom, Dr. WHO, Trail Hoover, Bondo Jovi, Oozing, Dry Foot 
Fairy, Amish It Head, Great at Giving Head, Sparky the Hobosexual (NH3), Pounder On It, Just Jeff, Just Susanne, Ben, 
and Seamus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>With gas prices in excess of $3 per gallon, the hare <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> decided to have the hash in 
another state.  After all, what did he care with his brand new spiffy efficient hybrid Highlander.  Pathetic.  Even more 
pathetic, the hare stood at the intersection of Quaddick Town Farm Rd. and Baker Rd. assuring everyone will find the 
start, even <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  And even MORE pathetic(!), <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, destined 
to join the Bahstan Hash House Harriers, managed to take a day off work to hare for RIH3.</p>

<p>Yet it gets better!</p>

<p>6:31 p.m. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> calls <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> who (not <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>) has not arrived yet with a car carrying himself, <font color="#FF0000">Pounder On It</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Jeff</font> (<font color="#FF0000">Pounder’s</font> brother), and <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Susanne</font> (<font color="#FF0000">Pounder’s</font> friend).  They were five minutes late, so the hare with pressure 
from <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> marked two large arrows pointing directly into the Quaddick Reservoir.  
Everyone else scampered and hid in the woods across the street.  <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> arrived and leisurely 
took his time parking.  Apparently, being late to a hash wasn’t a big deal.  Like being late for bowling [but I digress].
</p>

<p>The hidden wankers got a nice show of <font color="#FF0000">Pounder</font> changing her clothes, as <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Jeff</font> noticed the arrows and stood confused at the bank of the reservoir.  After a few moments 
of confusion (welcome to hashing <font color="#FF0000">Just Jeff</font>!), he finally asked <font color="#FF0000">Sparky
</font> if they were to circumnavigate the reservoir or go through it.  Um, duh!  Follow the arrow!  Even with 
uncontrollable giggles and Seamus barking from the woods, the clueless ones didn’t notice the others in the woods.  
Brilliant!</p>

<p>Then it gets worse.  All good things must come to an end.</p>

<p>With the clueless foursome not able to make up their minds, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> burst out of the woods 
to ruin it all.  Who was surprised?  No, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was not surprised!</p>

<p>[At this point, I should just stop writing, since this was the high point of the evening.  The rest sucked.  But I’ll 
continue anyway.  You, on the other hand, can just stop reading.  Again, I digress.]</p>

<p>For those stupid enough to continue reading, the late arrival of the <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> caravan 
allowed <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to arrive with the pack still there.  How pathetic!  Then they were off heading 
east along Baker Rd. for a short while, then through the woods heading north east.  It was quite an easy tromp through the 
woods led by <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
took the road, strongly suggesting where trail would end up.  It was not long until <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> stumbled upon a check at Quaddick Town Farm Rd.
</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> searched south.  <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> searched north.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided to go straight continuing east.  Only <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> were smart (stupid) enough to follow <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, who 
happened to be on true trail.  Mass confusion ensued behind them, as <font color="#FF0000">Just Susanne</font> ran in 
little rubber thingies, <font color="#FF0000">Just Jeff</font> mis-interpreted what a beer check was and searched for beer 
along trail, and <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> happily followed directly behind <font color="#FF0000">Pounder On 
It</font>.  Ah, the joys of hashing!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Async</font> finally set everyone straight (not that difficult) and all followed the FRBs east 
into the woods.  At this point in the run, nothing notable really happened.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> correctly 
guessed 5 (five!) checks in a row, which is less impressive than it sounds, since the trail was a monotonous clockwise 
loop over and into Quaddick State Park all along groomed trails, only to empty out on Quaddick Town Farm Rd. again.  
Justice, it seems, prevailed in the end as <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> guessed the sixth check wrong, only 200 
yards from the BC, and ended up last at the beer check.</p>

<p>At the beer check, the veteran hashers quickly soothed themselves in the murky and stinky water.  The meek chose to 
stay dry [I need not name names, like <font color="#FF0000">Pounder</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Jeff</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>].  The spirited ones sang in the rain whilst savoring 
the Guinness.  Brilliant!  Adding to the stench, both Seamus and Ben decided to piss in the waters.  Brilliant!  And no 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  Brilliant!</p>

<p>Again, all good things must come to an end.  With the sun quickly setting, the pack departed and backtracked through 
the only shiggy offered by the hare – a dried up brook.  Pathetic!  Those without flashlights at least managed to make it 
interesting.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> partook on an act of kindness and offered <font color="#FF0000">Pounder
</font> his flashlight, a most hashitable offense!</p>

<p>The hare not having lost all his dastardly ways sent the pack up Quaddick Town Farm Rd for about a mile and back down 
Baker Rd.  The endless pavement pounding left many whining and complaining, which brought smiles and laughter to <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>.</p>

<p>Circle was held in the dark, in the water, and only 10 feet from the road.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
decided to keep to his name and stick high and dry with the meek (not to name names… <font color="#FF0000">Pounder</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Susanne</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Jeff</font>, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, and 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>).  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, lonely from missing most, no ALL of the run, 
decided to have a conversation with <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, thus bringing the circle into chaos.  Order 
was restored, but then <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided to have a conversation with <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font> (obviously jealous of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>), and chaos again ensued, which pretty much summed 
up the comments on the run.  Total: <b>+6.9</b>!  RIH3 newcumers <font color="#FF0000">Just Susanne</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Jeff</font> were rightfully punished.  Hashit not to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for once.  
Rather, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  But does it really matter?</p>

<p>On-on-on was at Cady’s, for once smoke free! (See Hash <a href="hhh986.html">#986</a>).  Pizza and beer were devoured 
and not much else notable occurred, except for <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> going into the women’s room, <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> going into the women’s room to get <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> out only to find that 
it wasn’t <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>! (unless <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> wears women’s underwear, but we 
won’t speculate)  Well, given the appearance of the woman who walked out, one can justify the confusion.  Didn’t <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> get his eye fixed?  I digress.</p>

<p>And with that…</p>
