<p>Pathetic! Only a few hashers could find the time to make their way to the run this evening. Perhaps it was too hard to 
find? After all, clear and unambiguous directions to one of the most hashed areas in Rhode Island; that’s enough to confuse 
anyone. To be fair, there was also the understandable fear that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> would celebrate 
Groundhog Day by removing his pants and looking for a shadow. No worries there. At least as far as seeing a shadow is 
concerned. But the hash goes on regardless. Promptly at six-thirty an intrepid pack of <font color="#FF0000">Async, WHO, 
Basket</font>, and cohare <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> entered the woods behind the Tin Tsim Chinese restaurant east 
into a small nature preserve.</p>

<p>Trail led weaving like a drunken hasher (redundant?) east and south up the sides of Tracy Hill. The snow was moistened 
by the warming weather, but no other shiggy was found on trail. Pathetic! A check marked “SPQR” was encountered. The hare 
never did explain this. But to <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> disappointment, no muscular yet strangely sensitive 
gladiators showed up.  <font color="#FF0000">Async, Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> all knew that trail 
would lead to the power lines. After a while, they gave up trying to see the hares faintly-tinted flour marks on the snow, 
and concentrated on the footprints leading east.</p>

<p>They reached the power lines. Two parallel lines led south-southeast. Oh my! Which to choose? It turned out not to 
matter, because the trail jumped from one to the other, with a few pointless loops to the left and right, up to the top of 
Tracy Hill. At this scenic vantage 426 feet above sea level, they paused.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> pointed out 
the Newport Bridge far to the south. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could see the markers for the Brayton Point Power 
plant in Somerset. The hare couldn’t see the next pole on the power line 50 yds downhill. Pathetic! The expectations of 
the hashers for the rest of the trail were rapidly assessed and revised. They continued down the south slopes of the hill 
towards the Cat Rocks, but soon turned left and began a long bushwhack north along the eastern side of the hill, reversing 
direction in an unusually pointless and annoying way. Kudos to the hare! <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> grew tired of 
this and followed trail back on the power lines by listening to the whistles and horns, falls and profanities of <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> as they went on trail with the hare and Oozing.</p>

<p>They made it back to the power line at a junction station, and took the icy access road back to Rt 44. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and Async tried to find trail under 44 in a drainage culvert. They chickened out when they 
realized that the drain, fairly small in diameter, would get completely blocked if <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried 
to follow, and they might be responsible for flooding Apple Valley as the snow melted. Pathetic! They crossed the road 
through the traffic. Trail was found by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> north up the power line road, then entering the 
woods east along the frozen Hawkins Brook bed (mostly drained by the construction of Smithfield Crossings).  They made 
their way up to the bluffs overlooking the Target store. They found the BC next to the cemetery atop the cliff (left 
behind by the excavation for the shopping center).</p>

<p>After a beer, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was sent of to live-hare the way back, while the rest watched police 
squad cars driving around the stores below, doubtless searching for the source of the strange odors which had just  
appeared. A suitable time passed, and the group turned back and picked up trail west. It led to the powerlines! Pathetic! 
A brief jaunt south and then west to a residential area. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s </font>undetectable markings were 
abandoned, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led back through the Apple Valley Mall across 44 to the cars.</p>

<p>They circled in the woods behind the cars. Ratings were good: the wet snow, the prolonged hills and bushwhacking, and 
the lack of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> ensured a score of 6.9. Hashit ended up with <font color="#FF0000">
Basket.</font> Why not? Finally, the on on on: Swampy’s of course, for a warm welcome and fine al fresco dining (even if 
they were out of pickled eggs). They ate at the bar, were well behaved, and did not sing, throw food, or pour malt-vinegar 
in anyone’s beer. Pathetic! Hope springs eternal, and maybe next week will be the start of a new era. Or maybe it will 
be... Pathetic!</p>
