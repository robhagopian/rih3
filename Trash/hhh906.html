<font face="arial" size="2">Since we are so behind on the trash, I have decided to volunteer to provide the bare bones for 
each run I attend so's that the wanking hare, when he or she finally gets around to it, can at least remember who was there. 
Here goes:<br><br>

Location: Snake Den, Johnston<br>
Present: Basket, Bondo, Who, Oozing, WIPOS, Fuwangi, Birdbrain, Mother Goose, Just Tina, Seamus, Jake, Ben.<br><br>
Summary: A well-used, clockwise loop following the ridgeline southeast, to the powerlines, to Snake Hill Rd (Belfield Dr) 
W, back NW in woods and crossing north with some creative trail alterations into a tire graveyard for the beer check. Loop 
completed for short return to cars.<br>
