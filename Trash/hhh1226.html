and continued… Actually, few marks were seen. Most actually marks led to 
pointless excursions up and down the hillside sloping to the canal. The hash 
scattered all over the hill in search of marks as they made their inevitable 
northwest passage. Flashlights were soon needed. They crossed under 295, with 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT>, <FONT

he knew that he, at least could have a beer.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finally they came to a meaningful check. But alas, it was at the 
School Street bridge. And the old-timers at least, knew that this meant that the 
Beer Check would be somewhere near the Albion Dam on the other side. Sure enough 
the beer was found. But not enough beer. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> made it 
just in time, but late arrivals were begging for a sip off those who had been 
too slow to finish their meager rations. So, multiple songs had to be sung, just 
to deaden the pain. But at least <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> was no where 
to be seen.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

soon turned them to the railroad tracks and the bike path. No marks were found 
on either. Trail apparently went towards the river in another bushwhack. But 
this time no one was biting, and they just took the bike path back to Ashton 
Mills. They circled up, under the bridge.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

not enough real beer, and real marathon length were countered only by the 
(temporary, alas) loss of <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, the quality bimbos, 
and the first real need for flashlights in the season. Total: -0.69. Backsliders 
were punished, and naming were attempted.<FONT color=#ff0000> Just Pat</FONT> 
became “<FONT color=#ff0000>Brown-eye Taco</FONT>”. Don’t ask! <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Nick</FONT> became “<FONT color=#ff0000>Shemale Man</FONT>.” 
(Although <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> kept trying to keep the Mexican 
theme and call him She-mal-eh (as in tamale) (Don’t ask me how to get that 
accent thingy on the “e” in Word, and get it into html. Life’s too short.) 
Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Why not? On On On was, after 
an abortive attempt at getting them to reopen the kitchen at Tucks, at the 
Lodge. This is what comes from long runs beginning at 6:30. Learn from this, new 
hares!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
