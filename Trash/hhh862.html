<p>Wondering about the theme for tonight’s event, Eh? You might think it is because of the lame hare, lame hounds, or even 
a lame trail. You might be right, but then again…..</p>

<p>Starting from a dank and dirty 
parking lot off Rte 44, outside of the Durfee Hill Management Area, the hounds 
were chompin’ at the bit to get it on, but waited gallantly for the last hasher,
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, to arrive. The Hare didn’t have the same 
excitement, looking a bit despairing and forlorn. He wasn’t in any hurry to 
start, but politely explained about his bad back, with a compressed vertebra and 
weakened <s>ass</s> backbone. He carried some flour in a sack, and was 
explaining about the whole back thing, when <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> 
started complaining about twisting his ankle in an argument with his boss. 
Inserted his foot into his mouth and damn near chewed it off, he did.
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>added his 2 and a half rupee about his “Dead 
Man’s Ligament”, and the pain he’s experienced ever since the HolloWeenie Hash, 
one week hence. Sounds like someone’s trying to get it back, I’d say.</p>

<p>Well, there we are, complaining like old men, when <font color="#FF0000">Summer’s Eve SYB</font> starts talking about 
being on the rag, and breast pain and cramps. None of us could think of 
anything worse than that. It was like Quint and Hooper showing their scars. 
Remember Hooper speaking about his &quot;broken heart&quot; from a failed romance with 
Mary Ellen Moffett. Then it escalated from scratches to shark bites before 
Quint’s tale of injury as the most terrifying. He was scarred for life during 
the war, and it turned his existence into a personal vendetta against sharks.</p>

<p>A tattoo on his arm was removed - &quot;U.S.S. Indianapolis&quot; - but the internal scars remained.</p>

<p>In a long, memorable monologue, 
Quint tells how he was a sailor in World War II, his ship was sunk in twelve 
minutes by torpedoes from a Japanese submarine and about 1,100 men went into the 
water for about 4 days (and only 316 men survived) - about 800 sailors perished. 
As he remembers the grisly, hideous story of the fate of the shipwrecked <i>USS 
Indianapolis'</i> crew during the World War II-era, he recalls an attack of 
swarming sharks that began a half-hour later.</p>

<p>“Didn't see the first shark 
for about half an hour - a tiger - thirteen footer. You know how you know that 
when you're in the water, Chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the 
tail. What we didn't know was our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress 
signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first 
light, Chief, sharks come cruising'. So we formed ourselves into tight 
groups...the idea was, the shark comes to the nearest man and he starts poundin' 
and hollerin' and screamin'. Sometimes the shark go away. Sometimes he wouldn't 
go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into ya, right into your eyes. 
Y'know, the thing about a shark, he's got lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a <i>
doll's</i> eyes. When he comes after ya, he doesn't seem to be livin' until he 
bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white, and then - aww, then you hear 
that terrible high-pitch screamin', the ocean turns red, and in spite of all the 
poundin' and the hollerin', they all come in and rip ya to pieces...in that 
first dawn, we lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks, maybe a 
thousand. I don't know how many men. They averaged six an hour...Noon the fifth 
day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us. He swung in low and he saw us...and 
he come in low and three hours later, a big fat PBY [seaplane] comes down and 
start to pick us up. You know, that was the time I was most frightened - waitin' 
for my turn. I'll never put on a life jacket again. So, eleven hundred men went 
in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, and the sharks took the 
rest, June the 29th, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.”</p>

<p>…but that was another story. 
This one is almost as sad. The pack finally made it’s way out of the lot and 
down the dirt road heading south. The Hare said there would be flour about 200 
yards down, but it was much farther than that by the time we hit the first 
check.</p>

<p>Expecting it to veer off the 
main roadway, we checked high and low for another mark in the field adjoining 
the road. Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Summer’s Eve</font>, bleeding badly by 
now and holding her breasts tightly, caught sight of some flour further up the 
road, and called us on. Another check was encountered quickly, and most of the 
pack followed <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
into the woods.</p>

<p>Remembering <font color="#FF0000">Async’s</font> last trail, he set many circle jerks off 
the main road to confuse the pack, I stayed straight on course to the next 
intersection, then ran left towards a lake. The pack was making their way 
through the brush, towards my location, so I checked straight on, going right 
then left, until the pack found trail again going in the opposite direction. As 
I was making my way back, I spied <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> on all 
fours, trying to hide in the tall thin grass. He looked like one of the 
Fawangee’s, and thought he could hid that bulk of his in the grass. It was 
pitiful. Then I noticed Jake sneaking up behind him, and thought I should leave 
the two of them alone.</p>

<p>As I tried to catch the pack, I 
looked back and saw <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> walking about, and I knew 
something was up. This was going to be the beer stop, and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> gave pity on the poor bastard, advising him to hold tight here. 
Now, he’d have to stand out in the cold night air, all by himself, until we made 
our way back for beer. I hesitated for a short while, thinking, why should I run 
ahead, when I could stay right here and have a beer, overlooking the lake, with 
the dogs, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Then I remembered the opening 
scenes of Jaws, a pretty blonde girl skinny-dipping with a bunch of teenagers at 
a beach party one night.</p>

<p>She was Chrissie Watkins, who 
leaves the group sitting around a bonfire and runs toward the water, announcing 
that she is going swimming. Followed by a drunken male admirer, who is eager for 
an intimate swim, their run takes them along a run-down sand-dune fence - which 
in silhouette resembles skeletal bones or vertebrae - of a large fish. She 
strips off items of clothing one-by-one as she runs further down the beach 
before plunging in naked. Her silhouetted image splashes at the surface, first 
viewed from a distance far underwater and then from closer range. Her drunken 
teenage companion passes out on the shore. A metal buoy's bell on the surface of 
the water 'tings' at various intervals.</p>

<p>Suddenly, her nude body is 
pulled under and then dragged helplessly (pulled this way and then that way) on 
the surface by the unseen shark underneath, as she screams: &quot;God help me!&quot; For a 
brief moment, she is able to grab the buoy (sounding its death knell), but is 
then attacked and submerged for the last time in a horrifying sequence. The 
water surface is again still and quiet, but covered with blood, and my thoughts 
turn back to <font color="#FF0000">SESYB </font>bleeding along the trail. If she 
can finish this ball buster, then I can too.</p>

<p>I started running to catch the 
pack. I was alone, but at least I wasn’t alone with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. 
The first sign I saw of them was <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> running 
backwards, resetting trail, by marking it back towards the ‘now confirmed’ Beer 
Stop. He advised me that the shorter route would be back with the cripples at 
the lake, but true trail would be found to the left 200 feet. Thoughts of
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> flashed by me, and I ran to the left. Then 
flashlights shinning off the dark trees ahead, and the familiar, “On On!” was 
heard, as I joined the pack at the next check.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">The 
Slasher Dr. WHO </font>was running down Durfee Hill Road towards 44, and I 
shortcut through the woods in front of him. We continued running for a short 
while, until we both noticed we hadn’t seen any marks in some time.&nbsp; He turned 
around but I continued straight, thinking I could outwit the hare. (Having 
foreknowledge of the trails end, it doesn’t take much.) I ran almost to 44 
before turning around to catch the fleeting hounds. By the time I got back to 
the check, they were long gone, but I could here them calling off in the woods, 
to the right, opposite the direction of the end. I though for a moment, that 
just maybe the hare set trail ahead, then re-crossed the road to Durfee Hill 
again. I ran almost to the strobe light atop the Fire Tower, before realizing 
that I’d be way out in no mans land, so once again I turned around. When I 
arrived at the check, I couldn’t hear anything, so I went right onto the north south trail.</p>

<p>I followed the re-marked trail 
back to the lake, where <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>and
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> were enjoying beers around a blazing fire. 
The brightness caused my night vision to fail and I walked deliberately into the 
lake. I thought the two of them would piss themselves at my misfortune. In a 
short while, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was concerned that the main pack 
had not returned yet. They would have followed trail out to George Washington 
Lake Drive, then back to Rte 44, missing a check into George Washington Park, 
before going right on Durfee Hill Road and into the park just about the same 
location I had turned around a half hour before.</p>

<p>Eventually, they all made it in, 
with much joy and great jubilation. <font color="#FF0000">The WHO</font> ripped 
some cloth off his shirt, and with a nearby branch, tightened a tourniquet 
around his bleeding stumps of legs. “Why”, he asks, “do the damn crippled hares 
set such long trails? First it was <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> last 
week, with two artificial hips, and now <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> this 
week, with his vertebrae. Don’t they know they need to slow down when they hurt? 
It’s enough to make a healthy young doctor wish he were old and decrepit like they are.”</p>

<p>After songs we sung, and long 
discussions of bleeding wenches and limbs, we finished our beers and made our 
way to B2. It was a simple jaunt along the main road, and into the woods, where 
the hare received Down-Downs along with most everyone else. Hashit was returned 
to <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> for whining about the monthlies, then 
given to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for the poorest of excuses for not 
running trail. Then it was back to the cars to change and off to Cady’s.</p>

<p>I was first to arrive and asked 
the barkeep for a few pitchers to start off with. A local couple beside me 
questioned my attire. Her response to the bartender was, “ I want whatever he’s 
had” and her boyfriend’s comment to me was “no wonder you go out alone.” The sad 
truth was found shortly when a half dozen similarly dressed came trouncing through the door.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
ordered pizza, and with the beers in hand, we had a good night. As we started to 
leave, I happened to glance at the wooden barstool occupied by
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, and noticed the wood stained like a bloody 
stump. I guess <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> will be handling things 
himself tonight, and thoughts of future hashes will fall 28 days from today. No 
wonder he’s so grumpy so often.</p>

<p>Then my mind goes back to the scene in Jaws, where Quint asks Hooper, “What do ya got here? A portable shower 
or a monkey cage?”</p>

<p>Hooper replies, “Anti-shark cage.”</p>

<p>Quint say’s, “Anti-shark cage. You go inside the cage? Cage goes in the water? 
You go in the water? Shark's in the water? Our bloody shark?</p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in">(singing as we left old Cady’s)<br>
Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies,<br>
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain;<br>
For we've received orders for to sail to old England;<br>
But we hope in a short time to see you again.<br><br>0
<i>We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors,<br>
We'll rant and we'll roar across the salt seas,<br>
Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England,<br>
From Ushant to Scilly is thirty five leagues.</i><br><br>
Then we hove our ship to with the wind at sou'west, boys,<br>
We hove our ship to, for to strike soundings clear;<br>
We got soundings in ninety-five fathom, and boldly<br>
Up the channel of old England our course we did steer.<br><br>
Now the first land we made it is called the Deadman,<br>
Then, Ramshead off Plymouth, Start, Portland, and Wight;<br>
We passed by Beechy, by Fairleigh and Dungeness,<br>
And hove our ship to, off South Foreland Light.<br><br>
Then a signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor,<br>
All in the Downs, that night for to meet<br>
Then stand by your stoppers, let go your shank-painters,<br>
Haul all your clew garnets, stick out tacks and sheets.<br><br>
Now let every man drink off his full bumper<br>
Let every man toss off his full bowls;<br>
We'll drink and be jolly, and drown melancholy,<br>
So here's a good health to all true-hearted souls!</p>
