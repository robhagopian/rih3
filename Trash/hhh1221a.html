color=#000000>The cancellation (later rescheduling) of the Dragonboat races from 
fear of a little tropical storm rain led to the hare’s offering of a special 
Hurricane Hash, starting from the old Narragansett Raceway in Pawtucket, now the 
site of Building 9 1/9. A few intrepid souls ventured out and parked near the 
hare. The winds were in the 20 knot range. The rain was occasionally light, 
occasionally heavy, and the parking lot had puddles sufficiently deep to allow 
some Canadian geese to have a bit of<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

color=#000000>Live setting with flour, the hare was off at 1:45. At 2:00 sharp, 
the rest followed. Trail led south through the industrial area, but soon turned 
east and crossed the railroad tracks towards the bike path. Some nice puddle 
shiggy was found as the trail went through the woods parallel to the bike path. 
It was no challenge at first, as the pack crossed the railroad bridge at a 
check, and returned to the bike path. But a nice check soon thereafter sent the 
pack into a swamp next to the powerlines, where <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> missed the false mark and carried on. The 
rest soon found true trail leading into Slater 
Park.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail turned west in the woods. The hare’s marks were getting a 
bit soggy, as was the pack. They crossed the circumference road, and continued 
north in the woods briefly. Another check caused some confusion, and they were 
milling about on a field when they heard the hare’s whistle. He had been quite 
bored, and had been getting into the beer. Returning to the bike path, they saw 
the hare on a man-made island in the Ten Mile River. Crossing involved jumping a 
fence, and jumping off the retaining wall into the stream, crossing the stream 
and climbing another retaining wall to get to the beer check on the island. But 
with beer as an incentive…<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

A 140 lb, shaggy problem, to be specific. Somehow, with <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>’s help, he found a spot upstream where he could 
just manage to get himself and <FONT color=#ff0000>Cosmo</FONT> to the island. 
He joined the beer check already in progress, much to everyone’s disappointment. 
Some songs were sung, and a five minute headstart granted the 
hare.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The trail led across the island and into the woods on the other 
side. The streets were followed. East on Naushon, they came to a path leading to 
a gas pipeline. A check led into the woods, and out to the railroad tracks. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> decided to forego this, and took the bikepath 
south. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> 
were struggling to get <FONT color=#ff0000>Cosmo</FONT> off the island. The rest 
stayed on trail and crossed the rairoad bridge, back to the bike path. A quick 
check later, and they emerged from the woods next to the 
Raceway.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

be gainsaid by a small amount of pavement. Total: +6.9! Hashit went to <FONT
