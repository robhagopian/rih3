<P>Shiggy was minimal
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Bondo pleaded pedestrian and walked at 18.28
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Cheap Licker arrived via route 102 at 80 mph just to get On In
on time
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;The Slut (yes c'est moi!) arrived at 18.32, proving that 8 miles
on Route 44
<BR>&nbsp;from I395 is possible in 6 minutes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Short Neck,Thick Neck, you know who I mean, twisted an ankle
after just one
<BR>&nbsp;click and pleaded&nbsp; the renowned perambulatory challenged
defence and wimped
<BR>&nbsp;off from the On After
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Async nursed The Slut from the back of the pack after Cheap Licker
took her
<BR>&nbsp;flashhlight home and abandoned him (oui, c'est moi encore) to
the demons of
<BR>&nbsp;the forest, two of which were evidenced on four legs with wet
noses.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Bondo calls them dogs and I'm inclined to agree, however I have
encountered
<BR>&nbsp;some more interesting wet noses after dark in the woods but we
don't need to
<BR>&nbsp;go into that old Plymouth story again, do we!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;At last a Beer Stop, or Stumble for some, and a discussion of
how to avoid
<BR>&nbsp;the Rhode Island Hunters (the season opens tomorrow) while scouting
future
<BR>&nbsp;Hash trails.&nbsp; Conclusion, it's obvious really, do it in
the dark, as with
<BR>&nbsp;most things in life, I find, that saves an awful lot of embarassment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;On Back after the Beer Stop to a boring stretch of tarmac (that's
pavement
<BR>&nbsp;in American English)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;A circle of sorts, joined by
<BR>&nbsp;1) Why Puss claiming he had run the trail just 20 minutes after
everyone
<BR>&nbsp;else
<BR>&nbsp;2) Tinker who made no pretence of running the trail, he just
went to the On
<BR>&nbsp;After bar and warmed up the hostesses (more of which later)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;A Circle of sorts, one Hare's down down and on to the police
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;The entire Gloscester (yes, I've checked the deviant American
spelling)
<BR>&nbsp;police force arrived to investigate reports of yelling and sounds
in the
<BR>&nbsp;woods.&nbsp; 6 cops and three cars!&nbsp; Perfectly correct as
ever, it was Basket and
<BR>&nbsp;his Horn, we explained.&nbsp; Just a running club singing a few
songs ( the half
<BR>&nbsp;minds thought better of the oft declared drinking connection)
and so on to
<BR>&nbsp;the On After
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Tinker was right, Cady's bar had been warned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;A tour of the upstairs room, mind the Ghosts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oosing
thought they said,
<BR>&nbsp;Goats and got quite excited.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Plenty of pitchers, too many photos of our host's recent wedding,
at the
<BR>&nbsp;smallest Chapel in Connecticut, must be a bad omen that!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;WhyPuss chose to play pool while Cheap Licker complained about
her dismal
<BR>&nbsp;rating in the Newport Shagability League.&nbsp; Apparently she
did not score.
<BR>&nbsp;Can't understand that myself as I would give her a trial any
time, but then
<BR>&nbsp;I haven't been asked (and you probably won't ever be - Ed.).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp; Er, so that's about it, except of course Basket becoming disrobed
below the
<BR>&nbsp;waist somehow and his sarong appearing on the barmaid's head
(did I say
<BR>&nbsp;Head??).&nbsp; Also, a lively discussion about two Brits who
stayed nearby
<BR>&nbsp;recently and explained the meaning of 'pissed' to our barmaid.&nbsp;
We confirmed

<P>&nbsp;that it means drunk in English English which was a real surprise
to her, but
<BR>&nbsp;then you must remember she's the one who just got married, so
one has to
<BR>&nbsp;make allowances.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;That's it
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Basket drove home with no rear lights (on his car I mean)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Cheap Licker insisted the next time anyone drives home drunk
from a Hash
<BR>&nbsp;they should stay at her house, an offer I could accept frequently
(but 'ON
<BR>&nbsp;THE FUTON' - is that how we spell it, it's Couch in English English)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;And I ran out of petrol (gas) somewhere between Putnam and Norwich,
but
<BR>&nbsp;there was nearly a full moon, so that's alright.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;C'est la vie
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;or
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;as Louis XIV was reported as saying, when rebuked by his mother
about his
<BR>&nbsp;choice of ugly mistresses:-
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;"pendant la nuit, tout les chats sont gris"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;which, roughly translated (and I stand to be corrected by any
of you French
<BR>&nbsp;speaking bastards!)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;"during the night, all pussies look grey"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;Au revoir
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;The Slut >>
