<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF"><i>Present:</i></font>  <font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Bondo,
Just Big Shit, Dogmeat, ShortPeck, TrailHoover, JakeBenBaxter</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Pamela
Anderson </font>(or her lookalike, lets just call her Yummy II)</font>
<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2">The Run:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">and oh what a run! Despite rain in the forecast
and looming clouds, the RIH3 braves were juiced up for another fine M'rial run
and it helped when Yummy II showed us her tits and let the good dr. examine them
to make sure they were real and<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> (yes he posed
as one too!) tells me they were truly real!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hares promised running, bike riding, rope
slides and canoe riding (6.9 points omitted for no camel rides but <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
SD</font> is working on it). And we ran into the woods soon coming across wet
shiggy and water and rain, and it became difficult to keep eyes on the trail
with so many wet bimbos with wet T-shirts running around!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Soon bikes emerged and due to a shortage each of
the brave men gave each woman a ride (and the harriettes commended the long firm
posts they sat upon). With more trail soon a stream was cum upon where canoes
waited for the pack and off downstream over rapids they went, with the K9s (with
the exception of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>) having a tough time staying
in. The river proved tricky what with the rapids, falls, rain and yes, the still
wet T-shirts and soon a couple of them capsized.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A beer check was cum upon at which point fairies
and nymphets emerged forth thru the emerald forest and poured breast milk and
beer into the jewel-bedecked pint mugs. A dry sojourn was enjoyed by all 'neath
the palm leaves, before the pack set off again in their canoes towards Slatersville
Reservoir. The journey back was a Homeric odyssey, not least because of the
gusty winds and the buxomly mermaids who tried to stray the pack away from the
path. The trail was ingeniously marked with strategically appearing flashes just
over the water surface and led back to the docking site.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;ON ON at <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
where spicy paki-style bun kebobs were enjoyed and washed down with delicious
Trinity beer. The pack could only commend the hares on an outstanding &quot;run
of the year&quot; job done with the only negative point being that the run had
to end! &nbsp; And I believe Jake has Yummy II's phone number but he's not
barking.... </font></p>
