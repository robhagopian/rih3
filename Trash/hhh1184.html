style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">It’s a close 
call. Is Snake Den more overused than Lincoln woods? Or Burrillville Middle 
School? <FONT color=#ff0000>Async </FONT>alone has used this territory at least 
69 times! Not to mention <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>SESYB</FONT>, etc.etc. At any rate, the hare made his choice, and 
the hash followed. It was a cold night, cold enough that the all-male RIH3 
returned without bimbos, but with the almost-regular (why, why WHY?) Boston 
contingent, to the well-worn trails of Johnston, hoping against hope for some 
creativity. It was not to be.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail started 
from the parking area just beyond Dame Farm on Brown Ave. It led east and uphill 
to a dead end, and then was recovered heading downhill, then uphill, then down 
again. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> took off on his own. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> led as a 
check led northeast. The light snow made checks hard to see, not that there were 
that many checks. The ravine was entered, and the stream crossed easily. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Numb Nuts</FONT> acted 
quickly and got lost, despite the easily followed marks.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">There were a few 
swampy patches in the lower elevations, but the trail soon led <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> up to the ridge, and then southeast along the ridge 
to the summit of the Snake Den. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> soon followed. 
They came to the “B”. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> arrived from the opposite 
direction. They looked to no avail for the beer. Finally, the hare arrived. A 
fire was started. The hare lost his own beer, but <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> helped him out. Ah, a warm fire, some nice beer, and 
a lovely view of the pollution rising from the Johnston Landfill.

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Of course, we 
have all learned that nothing good lasts too long in the RIH3. A light down in 
the ravine was spied. Hoping it was <FONT color=#ff0000>Numb Nuts</FONT> and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT>, the group called out. Too bad for them; it 
was <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! Sighing, they finished up the beer, and 
after an appropriate waiting period, gave up on Boston and headed 
out.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail out 
continued down the ridgeline to the powerlines. South and down they went, 
crossing the river again, and turning west and north on familiar paths. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> had a nice fall on his right kneecap, but apart from 
this, there were no events as they came back out to the cars and the waiting 
wanks from Boston. They circled up.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Ratings for the 
run were dominated by the use of re-re-re…cycled trail, minimal shiggy, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo </FONT>at the beer check, and no bimbos. The only thing that 
saved it from being a true disaster was the loss of <FONT color=#ff0000>Numb 
Nuts</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT>. There is also the fact that 
this was the first fire of the season. Total: -0.69. Hashit was given to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, (who was begging for it) for making it to the beer 
check. Finishing up, they went to Ticker’s (the former Swampys) to find their 
kitchen closed. A quick call for pizza, and they had their meal. At least it 
wasn’t too expensive in dollar terms. But the psychological cost may be 
immeasurable.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
