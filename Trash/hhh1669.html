Present: Basket BoomBoom, O'boner; SnatchChat; Just Pat; Dr WHO; Bareback Buttplug; NextWeek/AlpacaLips Now; Rusty da Clown; Just The Tip; Turd the Beaver; Donkey Punch; Pubic Housing; Frozen Fanny; WIPOS; Chicken Man Eh'; and yours truly Oozing Syphilitic Dictaphone<br/>
Hashit: OOzing<br/><br/>

The run started by the ball fields at the southern entrance of Ryan Park. Indeed, the same Ryan Park where AlpacaLips grit his teeth as a hare at least eleven out of twelve times he's set trail. Talk about consistency. The weather was mid 30s/low 40s, brisk south easterly wind. It will be the last hash before daylight savings. A larger than usual pack congregated at this weeks run. Probably expecting crotchy cookies.
The pack was sent out and immediately got lost. Straggling the rear (an occupational hazard for the proctologist), Dr WHO found marks and called the rest of the pack that were aimlessly running in single line around the fields on the road. Talk of the blind leading the blind! Around the field, back on the road, and around the ball fields and a circle-jerk back to the start! Only the wiser more seasoned hashers like PH, WHO, Basket and yours truly knew better, and headed into the woods and eventually hit a mark. The trail was littered with felled trees from the previous weeks blizzard, which made the next part of the trail an obstacle run and quite interesting!<br/><br/>
Over the bridge and dam, around the pond, and back into the woods the aforementioned ran. Just The TIP looked lost without his usual female friend. Rusty galloped over logs shouting "tree" with such merriment and glee that Frozen Fanny had not seen since her teenage years. Donkey wasn't one to complain. Turd kept losing Molly. WIPOS was pleasuring himself. AlpacaLips marveled at the virgin territory, despite this being his backyard for a decade! Chicken Man Eh' wondered why he returned to the hash. Snatch was busy with FB live to document every moment of this run.<br/><br/>
The hares had split up at this point. Crotchy led us east, north than eventually westward, then back to the pond again. Another dam crossing, and beer check on the other side!
Beer was cold, cookies were good, but NOT crotchy originals, but were devoured by the pack nonethe less. Oozing tried to get the pack to sing but alas, either due to the plummeting temps, or disappointment from the cookies, the pack looked to move on. Molly hitting everyone with a stick in an already tight area didn't make it easier.<br/><br/>
The pack set out and soon hit the road, where the hare PG tried to run over as many hashers in her car as she could so as to save on beer.<br/><br/>
The circle agreed the trail was mostly virgin. 6.9 positive was the majority rating.
Oozing was given hashit for no good reason. Again. There were more deserving candidates. Molly for trying to impale everyones legs. SnatchChat for technology on trail. O'boner for modelling for a picture at the wet dam. Donkey for complaining. Rusty for his lack of nun jokes. The Tip for not b ringing his female buddy.
The ONIN was at the Carraige House which had decent drafts and food, and a good selection of beers.
And WIPOS for taking photos discretely. Somewhat creepily.<br/>
A good time had by all.<br/>

OnOn.
