Oozing advertised this hash as short and sour and it delivered so much that this writeup is as well.
<br/><br/>
Due to restrictions on group gatherings in RI, this hash started in Massachusetts near the site of an early pandemic kayak hash. We played an interesting game of pack the cars in on a segment of road that the town didn't feel the need to pave. Rusty's car was almost on trail and blocked in so he couldn't escape.
<br/><br/>
Trail dipped into the woods and after a false and some suspicious marks trail led out to the water. At the check pack continued further on the trail while your scribe went scouting nothing - only to return to the check to see the hare modifying trail. Whisky was enjoyed and the reflections of the clouds in the still water looked like ice and fog.
<br/><br/>
We moved on to the meat of trail which was a short run up to the beer, marked not once, but twice. Just the Tip managed to miss both and was heard off in the distance on (presumably) the out trail. We debated whether two B's was a play on 2 B or not 2 B and were starting to doubt the existence of said B when Rusty showed up and located it with such ease that I wonder if he placed it. I didn't manage to get a Captain's Daughter there but we enjoyed the beers and went back to the car for short circle where I got hashit for losing my whistle while delayering on trail (which was returned by a forgotten but kind hasher) - a preview of the following week where I lost my hat (unfound).
<br/><br/>
On-after was at a place forgotten by name where the beer was good but the indoor dining was sus ('suspect' for the old fahts) although being the only party in the establishment helped.
