access dock, and headed straight into the woods east. The pack was together as 
they came out into some fields, where a check sent them in all directions. 
Finally, trail was found at the Moosup river, crossing at Spencer Rock. Briefly 
they went south and then crossed the river again, this time, thigh deep, and 
back to the trail they could have just taken at any time. There were no laggards 
slow enough to catch on and miss the crossing. Not even<FONT color=#ff0000>

Fortunately, they found the right (left) path at the next check, and descended 
the hill back to the river. What would happen next? They crossed the river 
again. Trail skirted dangerously close to some homeowners, but none had time to 
load their shotguns.<FONT color=#ff0000> Flexi</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Just

time waist high. Up the hill they went, crossing the trestle trail, then 
downhill again. Finally, trail turned west. It paralleled the trestle trail for 
a while. <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> followed the hare and skipped this 
part, simply proceeding west on the trail. The others came out, far ahead.

color=#000000>A crucial check mark had been torn up by some dirt bikers. The 
lead pack just carried on, and was soon approaching the RI-Conn Airstrip. The 
hare, having a good chuckle, re-marked with an arrow. Trail bushwhacked north 
along the shore of the pond/swamp south of the actual pond. A check led to the 
dam between the two and the beer check. The beer was moved into the swamp side, 
so that the songs would not bother the non-hashers swimming at the nearby beach.

some reasonable shiggy, were powerful and only offset by the pond temperature, 
the lack of bimbos, and the eventual appearance of <FONT
