 <font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Async, Slasher Dr WHO, Basket
 BB, Short Peck</font>, virgin <font color="#FF0000">Just Jay</font>, visitors(?
 Nittney Valley) <font color="#FF0000">Horny Duck</font> and <font color="#FF0000">BETH</font>(bitcy
 and emotional towards hashers); returnees <font color="#FF0000">Flaming
 Arsehole</font> and ?<font color="#FF0000">HitN'Run</font> and your scribe <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
 SD.</font> </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">The Run: WHAT RUN? This was a sorry excuse for being
downright lazy! The only effort <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> put into this
one was the beer and hot chilli! And Boy was it good! You'll hear no complaints
from this one! </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, we all gathered at the River Island Park in
Woonsocket well before 630pm, but by the time everyone got their canoes/kayaks
and their sorry arses into the water it was 7pm! With lack of any form of
d'erctions etc, the pack set forth in the one logical direction: Downstream!
Apart from a near mishap with the canoe with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Jay</font> in it (worthy of mention as they had all
the beer), we sailed over rocks, shallow water and rapids and debris/shit and
down the river soon into country. We all now know where the city dumps its crap-altho
just to check <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> insisted on turning in his
kayak and tasting the water that he confirmed tasted only slightly better than
Bubweiser! Beer was soon consumed before embarking for over another hour into
what seemed like Canada!&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Songs were sung. Before dark (and just before
freezing my bollocks), <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> horn was heard and
we disembarked in Manville/ Lincoln. Rides back to cars and ONON to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font>
just about as the missus (<font color="#FF0000">Just BigShit</font>) arrived.
Circle in the garage. High marks for having three bimbos but no <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font>, down downs to the hare, virgin and visitors and backsliders and
hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (which he went on to desecrate by
burning). Great beer and food followed. Good time had by all and not a drop of
flour seen all night! </font></p>
