  <br><br><font color="#0000ff">The 
Run:<br> </font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The RIH3 is an optimistic hash. This is in the face of 
incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. For example, <font color="#ff0000">Justin My Ass</font> has been on the hareline for sometime. He has 
set "trail" maybe three times, and combining those three experiences into one 
might actually make one real trail. So it should have been no surprise that 
<font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> called upon himself to take over 
when JIMA wanked off yet again. (Some might say that that would be small 
improvement, but the RIH3 is also a charitable hash. At least the start was not 
the Burrillville Middle School.) So only a few desperate ones showed, along with 
<font color="#ff0000">Microhard</font>    
            
              
            
               
            
               
             
         (who makes appearances 
that roughly correspond to the hatching of the 17 year cicadas, it would 
seem.)<br><br>The start was from Effin's parking 
lot on Rt 5 in Smithfield. The pack was directed to look for marks across the 
street, and they quickly found trail at the K ofC, or VFW or Elks or whatever, 
just south of Box Seats. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> went straight for the 
path along the reservoir, while <font color="#ff0000">Async</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> found the true trail through the adjacent woods. They 
came together soon, and continued south. The spillway was crossed, an unecessary 
excursion as it happened, since trail led back out and across Rt 5 to find <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>             
              
                 
              
            
            
         and Ben walking leisurely along. They 
entered the trail to the river and continued to a check under the 116 
bridge.<br><br>Async found the false mark further 
along the river. <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font>            
considered crossing the river, but seeing no marks, decided against it. Finally 
they tried right, and came up onto Rt 116 heading southwest. An old, make that 
ancient, flour arrow was seen, indicating entry into the industrial lot. That 
flour must have some staying power as the last time the hash led here was <a href="hhh1138.html">Run #1138 </a>in January! But there were no 
fresh marks that way. <font color="#ff0000">Microhard</font>         
  found true trail, entering the woods uphill and south.<br><br>The trail was now narrow paths with some bushwhacking. It 
couldn't really be called shiggy, but it was a pleasant change from the trail 
thus far. <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> found trail at the next check which 
turned east to the powerlines. They soon were heading north, and back to the 
path on the south side of the river. Some confusion ensued and the hare looked 
amused. He was the only one. Finally, <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> took the 
hare's hints and turned west, running through the "X" and back to the 116 
bridge. Some fresh marks were found. Oh, that tricky hare! Wanker! Sure enough, 
the river was to be crossed. Bowing to the inevitable, they swam across (except 
for Bondo, who took the bridge). The beer was recovered from its hiding 
place by the hare and they had their BC at last.<br><br>Trail back was 
through the woods, with the few checks being ignored by most. <font color="#ff0000">Async</font> and <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> bushwhacked 
straight to the cars, the rest took the slightly longer trail. With some nice 
rain and lightning starting, they held the circle at the north end of the 
parking lot, concealed by a hedge and the weather. Ratings for the run: overused 
territory, no bimbos, and limited shiggy were the main comments. Total: -6.9! 
Hashit was given to <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> for avoiding the river 
crossings. They finished up and moved into Effins, where the pool was closed 
because of the lightning storm. Another wasted evening for the Rhode Island 
Hash.</span>
