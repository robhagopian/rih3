Run # 1740 July 15, 2019<br/>
The WIPOS lays one in the Arcadia Forest, Escoheag Hash<br/>
Where: Escoheag Hill Rd<br/>
Hare: WIPOS<br/>
Present: Rusty, WIPOS, Who, Just the Tip, Basket, OOzing, Fineass Cuntsultant, Frosty, O'Bone'r, Fecal, Rainbow Dick<br/>
Hashit: Basket<br/><br/> 
Weather: Pleasantly warm with a few bugs at the start, but they started swarming as soon as we left the car-park and the humidity set in.<br/><br/>
I did a couple routes at Hemlock Ledges just down the road before making it to the Hash. The car park was half full and quickly topped out as Rainbow, OOzing and Frostie arrived. Last in was Just the Tip after we started out. We enjoyed a prelub beer and had some discussion about accommodations in Edinburgh for the Euro Hash in August. Frosty handed me a spray can of bug juice and pointed out that it was already 6:35, so the pack took off with a whimper.

WHO was strolling along followed by OOZing, O'B and Rainbow. I passed them with my usual early burst of speed and soon found I was far behind the FRB's, at the first check. It appeared to point to the right, I took the bear right trail instead of the 90 degree right. It wasn't long before I found I was not on trail and could hear the FRB's calling off to my far right. But now, I was heading downhill followed by a storm of deer flies and didn't want to have to struggle back up. Behind me, I heard OOzing call, "RU?". I replied I was off trail. I continued downhill into the valley and, every now and then, another couple "RU?s" was heard behind me. Finally I shouted, "I AM NOT ON TRAIL!" Still they followed.<br/><br/>
At the bottom of the hill, I found the trail I had hoped would be there leading to the right. I took it and soon found flour heading in my direction on a falsie. Then Fineass and Frosty were calling just in front of me. I called on to the two following my lead. The horseflies were getting bad, so I made my little branch with leaves hat that confused the little buggers. Fineass did the same and we were enjoying a bug free jaunt, almost.<br/><br/>
In a short while, we came upon WIPOS at the Whiskey Check. I enjoyed a wee dram of Irish and took off after the pack. We came to the bridge and a trail leading off the road to the Stepping Stone Falls, where WHO, Rusty, Fecal and Just the Tip. JTT arrived after we left so he short-cutted past us somehow and was helping with the search for beer. Soon everyone else joined in looking in vain, until WIPOS finally arrived carrying the backpack filled with out reward. WHO and Rusty grabbed a Captain's Daughter, while the rest of us enjoyed something less, but still refreshing. I took a rest under the falls and enjoyed finally getting away from the bugs. The water was cool and I don't know why I was the only one WHO thought it was a good idea.<br/>3 peas in a pod<br/>

Back on trail, it was a medium trek uphill and back to the cars. Circling up. the Hare enjoyed mostly good comments and ended up with a positive zero. Not bad for WIPOS Hash. No Visitors, so the Back Sliders: O'Bone'r, Fineass and Frosty stood in the circle and were justifyably abused. Next Hashit fell on me for being the only one found under the falls. And so here is my write-up. The END
