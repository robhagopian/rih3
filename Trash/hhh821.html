was placed in the crock pot at the home of <font color="#0000FF">Basket </font>&amp;
<font color="#0000FF">Dog Meat </font>at 1 p.m., just to ensure the meat was 
fully cooked and fully mushy. &nbsp;The celebration started right on time at 6 p.m. 
at their home where <font color="#0000FF">Basket </font>and Baxter were waiting 
for the RIH3ers. &nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">Oozing </font>and <font color="#0000FF">
Basket </font>had started with whiskey when <font color="#0000FF">Ever Ready 
Eager Beaver 69 </font>and <font color="#0000FF">CompuSex</font> arrived wearing 
of the kilts. &nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">Dr. Who</font> arrived with the Scottish 
cap but without women's clothes wrapped around his waist, <font color="#0000FF">
Basket </font>was quick to accommodate with clothing and whiskey. When
<font color="#0000FF">WIPOS</font> walked in, he yelled, kicked, screamed and 
had an out and out temper tantrum that the only kilt left was 3 sizes too big 
for him to actually run in. &nbsp;We didn't know if he was going to stop crying and 
whining when there was a knock at the door...a visitor from Baahston, Kneeling 
Room Only. </font></font></p>

Ever Ready Eager Beaver 69</font> has been flirting with the local hash chapters 
and promoting the RIH3 and she had even passed out d'erections in her travels. 
Scotch was drunk, with Scottish, Polish, Italian, and even Pakistani toasts as
<font color="#0000FF">Oozing</font> read from the poetry of the beloved Robbie 
Burns. At this point, everyone stopped listening to him and
<font color="#0000FF">Basket</font> and ran out the door of the house to the 
starting point. &nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">Ever Ready</font> was chosen to drive, 
without directions and the smell of haggis on her mind, we all got lost, good 
thing Baxter was around to find us and when we actually found the start of the 
hash (not a hash mark, mind you), there was another visitor! &nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">Funky 
Diva</font> was breathlessly awaiting the RIH3ers! <br>
<br>
As we all looked high and looked low for <font color="#0000FF">Async</font> and
<font color="#0000FF">PW</font>, we heard <font color="#0000FF">Basket </font>
drive up behind us. &nbsp;He claimed he was looking for the carload that
<font color="#0000FF">Ever Ready</font> was driving but we know he was, should 
we say, consoling himself in his car because once again, no
<font color="#0000FF">PW!</font> &nbsp; <br>
<br>
The run was nearly impossible (impassable), no hash marks, plenty of briar 
patches, shiggy and water crossings. &nbsp;The first beer check was in front of an 
old battalion (according to <font color="#0000FF">Basket</font>) there was a 
hasher at this beer check (was it Robbie Burns) and we had lost
<font color="#0000FF">Funky Diva</font>. &nbsp;We yelled, hollered RU???? &nbsp;We drank, 
we yelled, we sang, but no <font color="#0000FF">Funky Diva</font>. &nbsp;We 
continued on........up, up, and up to the Highlander Hills. &nbsp;At the top of the 
Highlander, we found <font color="#0000FF">WIPOS</font> meditating on a rock, we 
found spirits in the woods, but of Robbie Burns not the correct type of spirits 
because we did not find any beer! &nbsp;Finally, after much whining and crying,
<font color="#0000FF">Basket </font>arrived with beer and song. &nbsp;All of a 
sudden, the dogs started barking, everyone turns around to listen to the sounds 
in the dark woods, the full moon above us...what is it? &nbsp;Who is it?? &nbsp;It is
<font color="#0000FF">Funky Diva</font>!! <br>
<br>
The last part of this hash was as the beginning, no hash marks, many briars, 
much shiggy and too much water crossings. &nbsp;The weather was turning cold and the 
moon was bright. &nbsp;(<font color="#0000FF">Ever Ready's </font>arse was wet and 
cold) <br>
<br>
The On In was filled with haggis, the meat filled stomach, and potatoes - and 
thank you <font color="#0000FF">Dog Meat</font> for pork (the other white meat). 
&nbsp;The run was rated at +6.9 by all, <font color="#0000FF">Bondo </font>slipped 1F 
in the rating but was upset at the sight of a favorite beer mug and has declared 
war on the home of <font color="#0000FF">Basket </font>&amp; <font color="#0000FF">
DogMeat</font>, the BH3ers have never experienced this type of trail on Beacon 
Street or Comm Ave and were very appreciative. &nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">Funky Diva</font> 
was wrapped in a homemade kilt and was re-named Compost/Compass by the RIH3 and 
more scotch was consumed. &nbsp;<font color="#0000FF">Oozing</font> continued to read 
Robbie Burns poetry, <font color="#0000FF">Basket </font>continued to sing, the 
dogs continued to bother <font color="#0000FF">DogMeat</font> and her pussy cats 
and then everyone had to return to their bunk beds, for it was very late for a 
Monday Evening of the RIH3..... <br>
