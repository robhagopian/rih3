This is trail number four in the 2022 Sex-Fuckta trail series.* And it came with such promise: a *virgin* parking lot!<br/><br/>
At 6:30 and no sign of the hare we started to advance into the woods when at great speed a car flew down the entrance. The hare! Words were exchanged and after a vague chalk talk we resumed our search for the nectar of the gods.<br/><br/>
We promptly ran into a 'B'. There was much searching and a bag was located but it only contained some sort of cement/construction debris. WHO would stay and build a fire instead of running trail?<br/><br/>
Your scribe got on (yellow) trail and found the shiggy side cut which led back to trail. Trailing a bit at this point, we came upon another side cut which led quite into the areas close enough to the highway to make communication amongst pack difficult. If one can consider two hashers a pack. It's unclear where everyone else went but the marks were with us.<br/><br/>
We rejoined the trail system much to our detriment. Yellow and white parallel and all this did was cause your scribe to end up approaching a check from the direction it had been kicked[/solved] to. The two-pack found an arrow but also marks off on another side cut. Unfortunately the marks went nowhere and the arrows led to WIPOS. WIPOS contributed by suggesting beer locations by the Lodge which seems reasonable until one looks at a map (particularly noting where we were). But the worst was over and we made it to beer...<br/><br/>
... Shockingly at the same 'B' we were at before but the beer had improved. And there was a fire now so we built the fire up and lingered for circle by the light (and heat).<br/><br/>
Accusations were flying (WHO lit the fire?!) but by lack of any interest in any particular hashshit your scribe was assigned. As I recall - amendments are solicited<br/><br/>
The Lodge was delicious. Note they close the kitchen at 9pm (see also: next week's hash trash)<br/><br/>

Run #1866 O'Bone'r's Virgin Parking Lot or How Short Can You Make It<br/><br/>
The new parking lot for the Moshassuck Nature Preserve at 3 Sherman Ave, Lincoln, RI was the start of this 'Bar Setting' Hash. We've been through these woods a number of times, but now the area north of the Lincoln Woods addition, behind The Lodge, continues along the Moshassuck River to Sherman Ave. With the addition of a few new bridges this expansion is very nice. WHO, Rusty, WIPOS, Cracker, Just Pat and I were ready to start out at 6:30 as the Hare pulled in, with the explanation of being late getting out of school. I started out with Rusty before hearing the Hare say there was a Turkey/Eagle split.<br/><br/>
The trail started out along one of the fairways of the Fairlawn Golf Course and took a right over the bridge crossing the Moshassuck. On our immediate left was the memorial to a woman that served the local Boy Scouts. We've had a few beer stops here in the past and as soon as Rusty, OOzing, WHO and JP saw it they looked for beer. They were disappointed, but did find the "B". OOzing traveled a bit farther, and found the 'Beer Near' sign. Needless to say WHO did not go any farther (setting a new low in distance traveled on a Hash) and waited for the Hare to bring the goodies. He offered to start a fire and sit his arse on the stone benches, while he waited for the pack to come back and enjoyed a Captain's Daughter for his hard work.<br/><br/>
OOzing continued traveling (backwards) on trail until he came to the 3 arrows pointing back to the 'B'. He lost trail, turned around and joined the Hare and WHO at the fire, grabbing his Captain's Daughter for his hard efforts.<br/><br/>
I was on trail with Rusty. We had just passed WIPOS and found a couple of the new bridges. After a bit, the flour ran out. Rusty was in front of me and he turned around, thinking he was off trail. He left searching for the trail in a new direction. With Rte 146 close on my right, I continued on and eventually found flour again. I called the PackOnOn. At the next check, two sets of eyes stared at me in the darkness. Rusty caught up with me and said hello to the four eyed deer, then he traveled on. I followed him uphill to the next intersection. He went right and I left. He found flour but as I was committed left and downhill, I continued on as the trail would eventually make a left turn and join me as it led to the Beer Stop.<br/><br/>
I found a shiggy pit nicely covered with leaves that left my feet a bit damp, but soon I hit flour again. I called Rusty OnOn, but I did not see his light and had not heard him calling for some time. I soon found the 3 arrows on the Turkey Trail and was at the Beer Stop with the Short Cutting Bastards. It was a while before the tree amigos: Rusty, Just Pat and Cracker, would join us. Rusty had lost trail and that allowed the other two to catch up with him. It would be a while later that WIPOS joined the fray to enjoy the fire, beer and snacks. It was such a delightful spot and so close to the cars, that Rusty made a motion that we stay here for the Circle. By unanimous vote, we said yes. O'B went back to her car with JP to get more beer. This suited WHO as he waddled not more than 200 total yards, but his fire was a nice touch.<br/><br/>
Rusty rated the trail a 6.9 with an explanation almost as short as the trail to the BS was, very unlike his usual boring 5 minute dissertation. The rest agreed (mostly) and even WHO gave a positive 6.9. The Hare drank and sang something. With no backsliders, visitors or virgins, Rusty stood in for last week's Hashit. He recommended Basket, WIPOS and WHO, but we all agreed on Just Pat. After Swing Low, most of us traveled to The Lodge to finish off the evening. OnOn.
