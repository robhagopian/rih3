color=#000000>Arriving at the familiar parking lot under Ross Rocks in Old 
Furnace State Park in Connecticut, the hare left to live set, with fifteen 
minutes head start. <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> stated with certainty that 
it was “too far” for the hare to circle the pond. That is also exactly what he 
did the previous time he had set here. And if <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> 
is certain about something, the rest of the hash knows. He will be completely 
wrong.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"

brain, they would have just gone straight up to the rock climbing area, and 
waited for the hare. But no! Even <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT>, arriving as 
the last straggler mastered the first check and started south down the east side 
of the pond, didn’t take the easy and obvious route. <FONT

exciting spot for a beer check. Guess what?<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

straight for the rocks. The hare and the beer were soon found. Within 25 yards 
of where he had had the BC before. Beer and song ensued, driving some nature

<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> wasn’t even in the water. Ratings for the run: 
no shiggy, recycled trail, and about the only positive was the dramatic 
egg-sized hematoma developing upon <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>’s left 
buttock. Face it: the trail sucked. Total: -6.9. Hashit went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Why not? After the ceremony, they went off to some 
restaurant on Rt 6. It probably sucked, too. Just like this write-up. You get 
what you pay for.</FONT></SPAN>
