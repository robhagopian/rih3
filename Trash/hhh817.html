<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF"><i>The Run:</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The hare 
had the audacity to start just 800 yards from <font color="#FF0000">Async’s</font> 
humble mansion, in this highly patrolled police state called Barrington. Once 
home to blue collared workers, digging quahog from the bay; now pushed out by 
Lawyers, Bankers and thug Politicians who refuse to allow local pubs from 
serving a much needed and calming drink after a day’s hard work.&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> has yet to invite the hash to his ranch, and 
the thought that we may actually run past, caused him to alert the Police of our 
activities. Unmarked Ford’s followed us throughout the trail with drivers of 
dubious character.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
had just a minute to discuss the obnoxious discussion I had on the net about 
her, before I pulled up to <font color="#FF0000">Eager Beaver’s </font>house. 
Joined shortly by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">
Palm Pilot</font>. We waited a long 10 minutes for the venerable
<font color="#FF0000">Slasher Dr.WHO</font>, who had promised to join us, 
especially this close to his home in Tiverton. We were unaware of his charitable 
work on <font color="#FF0000">PW,</font> and we are all praying it is a 
success.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The Hare 
pointed us off in the direction towards <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, 
along the winding streets straddled with manicured lawns and security cameras. 
We made our way out to the main drag and crossed behind a school. The windows 
were all covered over with pictures of their parents and words of love and 
tenderness, as this is the Christmas season they had been taught early the ways 
to garner as much as possible during this most capitalistic holiday. We don’t 
celebrate it in Pakistan, because we already have plenty of rock presents from 
Ramadans past.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The trail 
went into the woods and split, with <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>going off 
to the right and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and Baxter traveling 
straight. Evidently <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had prior knowledge of 
this trail, but refused to invite the hash here for obvious reasons.
<font color="#FF0000">Async’s</font> trail was true, of course, and he led the 
pack out to another road. The hare had placed an arrow pointing towards
<font color="#FF0000">Async’s </font>house, but by the time we got there it had 
been scratch out by someone’s trainers. The pack followed right, and despite the 
unmarked car following us, we made our way behind yet another school. The 
officer parked in the driveway and waited until we exited through the play area 
and into someone’s back yard.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">We arrived 
at <font color="#FF0000">Eager Beaver’s</font> sister’s house for beer and 
champagne. Since it was the New Year Hash, we all celebrated with the bubbly, 
and since it was somewhat chilly, we made our way in to urinate there. Her 
sister's house was extremely tidy and neat, unlike her the Beav’s. We didn’t 
have to pick last weeks pizza off the floor or anything. They are Glass 
Painters, and examples of their fine art were everywhere. I tied to stick a few 
samples into my jock, but the cold glass was enough to cause even grater 
shrinkage than did the run in freezing temperatures. Baxter drooled all over the 
kitchen floor along with <font color="#FF0000">Tinker (not bell),</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> found a proper place to eliminated his 
extended bowel problem.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">We exited 
when “The Man” arrived again, and ran back into the woods. This trail took us 
back towards the first school we had passed, and found <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS’s</font> car parked in the car park. It was obvious he had been ‘Car 
Hashing’, an immediate nomination for Hashit. He would find us soon, as we hid 
the beer inside sister’s house. We arrived at Smelly Beaver’s shortly thereafter 
and circled up around a trampoline covered in leaves from the last few seasons 
from the depth of them. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Beer was 
brought out and the hare received a justly deserved ‘Down-down’ for a fair hash, 
in “VIRGIN” territory (read <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>is scared). Next
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> arrived and made his way onto the trampoline 
for his “Late Cumer”&nbsp; down-down, then I was invited aboard to share my wit and 
suggestions to pass along the HASHIT. Choice were plenty the most deserving, by 
his own admission was <font color="#FF0000">Async.</font> Visitor
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Palm Pilot</font> 
got theirs and then we invited <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to do his 
famous two and a half gainer on the springboard.&nbsp; Swing low was sung and we 
adjured inside for more beer and food.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The hare’s 
sister arrived with another girlfriend just as pizza, Coney Island Dogs, and 
cute little bread thingies with fillings.&nbsp;&nbsp; You won’t see food like 
this in England or Pakistan for that matter. Everything was delicious including 
the visitors. If Trail Hoover hadn’t been there, I might have shagged the both 
of them right there, sisters or not.&nbsp; We ate and sang songs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Naturally, due to the presence of respectable civilians, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>began singing the nastiest of the hash song repertoire, including 
songs about gang rape and sadomasochism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">
Smelly</font> brought out more beer and a CD of hash songs so we could rest our 
voices. <font color="#FF0000">Palm Pilot</font> Allowetta'ed
<font color="#FF0000">Stinky’s</font> sister and after abusing the neighbors we 
kissed all a good night and made our way home. Good Hash, good food, good beer, 
what a way to start the New Year. </font></span>&nbsp;</p>
