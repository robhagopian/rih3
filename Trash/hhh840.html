<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>
<p>Scribe’s disclaimer: I wasn’t really there, but <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> described the run to me in such 
detail (while he was doing my colonoscopy) that I feel like I ran the whole thing and even had a little poison-ivy rash 
develop on my left ankle where the kevlar seals have been leaking lately. Anyways, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
would never lie or exaggerate. So this account is guaranteed to be completely accurate.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Async, Bondo </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> joined the hare off Fish Road in 
Tiverton in front of Monique’s Pet Salon (and Pubic Hair Stylist). Promptly at 6:30, they were off across the pavement 
west onto an abandoned dirt road leading to an abandoned campground. A few checks were easily dispatched and the trail 
followed off the road into the woods. What a great trail it was! Just the right mix of briars and underbrush, leading 
into a really smelly swamp. And the flour had been placed so carefully that the pack was forced to stay together. <font 
color="#FF0000">Async </font>commented that it doesn’t get any better than this. But I don’t want to embarrass the 
hare.</p>

<p>From the swamp the trail led south along an overgrown path that the hare had carefully trimmed with a machete. Then it 
turned back across the swamp, now a small stream, and led out to another path. The hashers had never seen such 
consideration from a hare before. Meanwhile back at the start, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had arrived. His 
vision was particularly bad this day, but the term ‘blind luck’ was coined with him in mind. He stumbled onto the road to 
the campground, blew blindly through the checks, missed two false trail “X”s, and ran straight to the beer check. He sat 
disconsolate. Lonely <font color="#FF0000">Basket!</font> “Why doesn’t anyone like me?” he wondered. The mosquitoes fed 
well.</p>

<p>On trail the hashers were having the time of their lives. West to a check, north up a dried-up streambed, they ran. 
<font color="#FF0000">Async </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> led the way. There was so much flour! The hare 
hung back to make sure that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was enjoying himself as well. The distant echoes of “F*ck 
this sh*t!” and “The hare’s a f*ckin’ a**hole!” were certain proof of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s </font>approval. By 
the time the group reached a dirt cliff leading to a construction area, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had provided 
the run with a well deserved 47 F*ck rating as he climbed the steep slope. A few more brilliant and innovative checks and 
the group headed back into the woods. This trail was the best!</p>

<p>At this point unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse. At least, temporarily. Like the sound of the rotting 
boards of the outhouse toilet seat creaking before they break and collapse into the pit, a bugle was heard in the 
distance. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had become ashamed at missing what he knew must be the trail of the year, 
and had set off to try and follow the trail backwards. Poor Basket! He didn’t get very far. Luckily, <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> came upon him before he became irretrievably lost. 
The group straggled uphill through a small pool of standing water and mud to the beer check. This was an overgrown pagan 
altar, a circle of mystic stones on a ridge above a deep valley. [This was the site where the virgins of Tiverton were 
subjected to ritual sacrifice, and had been allowed to go to ruin when Tiverton (almost immediately) ran out of virgins.] 
The mystic forces at play were almost palpable.</p>

<p>The hare had provided flowing quantities of fresh-crafted beers: a porter and an IPA. The beauty of the spot was 
breathtaking. The trail was described to Basket in glowing terms, and you could almost hear <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s
</font> crest falling. Sad <font color="#FF0000">Basket!</font> When all had drunk their fill, the trail was resumed, 
heading north along the ridge and then cleverly down to another dried-up streambed. Back up the steep hill east through 
dappled woods of maple and pine, they followed the well-marked trail. Their hearts filled with joy as they ran. They came 
out of the woods into a field, and then through a parking lot, down a short driveway back to Fish Road and the cars. What 
a fantastic way to finish!</p>

<p>The circle was held behind Monique’s in a clearing. Ratings were of course outstanding: even with no bimbos, the group 
was effusive. “Well done, indeed!” said <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. “Bravo!” said Oozing. “This f*cking s*cked!” 
said <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> hung his head in shame. Bad <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket!</font> Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> because <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> was too obvious and was suffering enough anyways.</p>

<p>The on on on was none other than the Li’l Bear Lounge. The group was joined by <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">KNO,</font> who had brought a friend who listened to the tales of the hash with ill-concealed 
envy. The group moved outside, where the hare thoughtfully provided warm clothing for anyone who was chilled by the 
slightly cool evening breezes. A beautiful sunset over Mount Hope Bay, pizza from Tiverton’s own Famous Pizza restaurant, 
and pitchers of beer from the lounge, refilled from the trunk of the hare’s car made for the perfect end to the perfect 
hash. At least this is how <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> described it to me.</p>
