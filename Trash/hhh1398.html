The information on the start point for tonight’s run sounded like we might be meeting at a Jiffy Lube parking lot but as usual, with the description from a hare, it was exaggerated. There were some patrol cars floating about but no car repairs in sight, actually there was no sign of the hare either until a short time before the run started.<br><br>

The two-timer was greeted, no need to explain marks and there was going to be one BN. Trail headed back out of the park, with Crabby and She Mail up front. This was actually the last time She Mail was seen until we were almost finished at the beer stop, apparently he traversed the entire 1500 acres of the park and failed to back track after he lost flour. <br><br>

Hash basics you say to yourself, more beer for the rest of us said the rest of us. <br><br>

One of the early checks had us all fooled into running a circle jerk that hadn’t even been the intention of the hare, AQ soon found the real trail but was startled when he heard the cry “asssssquack” as a low flying duck zipped across his path. Basket was heard in the way back, shouting on-on while at the same time trying to get Bondo to catch up with us. Donkey was still writing notes for the hash trash and Pubic and DogMeat went for a stroll about the park, laughing as they had the pack pass them multiple times.<br><br>

PG led us down the path by the water, whereas Oozing wanted the high road up by the parked cars. He muttered something about making easy money, the next time we saw him he was smiling and drinking a can of bud light. The hare had advised us that because this strange man had been following him it resulted in the necessity to hide the beer away from the actual B mark, thankfully the hare was present to direct us the extra 100 yds to find it. Three shades were on offer tonight, Basket enjoyed what he thought was a Loose Cannon but it turned out to be a Newport Storm – can’t even tell the difference Jimmy??<br><br>

Some 15 minutes later we saw a light in the distance, repeated suggestions that it was a shooting star were ignored and we were soon greeted with the arrival of SheMale along with his tales of woe about having been all over the place. We finished up, and headed out on the in trail that would lead us to the parking lot where our cars were being guarded by a nice Providence Police Officer. Basket went over to introduce himself, and we quickly came to the conclusion that this was not the best spot for the circle. Despite hesitation, fear, and the potential to create insurmountable work for himself, Amish decided to invite us back to his abode with strict instruction about not fucking around with any of his stuff like we did the last time.<br><br>

The circle took place in his garage, lighting arrangements were courtesy of Dog Meat and Crabby ended up with the HashShit because she started talking about nominating someone. The two-timer was introduced to the circle and at the same time he was bid farewell as he sets off to pastures with less taxation.<br><br>

Following the circle we were amused with the attempts to start Oozie’s car, he had a very dead battery. Picture this if you will, Amish has the boat and the high capacity jumper leads attached to the German engineered car. The boat is revved up, the signal is given to Oozie to turn the key but nothing happens. He then opens the door and starts to chat with SheMale, meanwhile all the internal lights come on in the BMW and quickly drain all of Amish’s efforts. A call was placed to the AAA rescue squad and they came out and switched the battery for the lad. <br><br>

Meanwhile, the rest of us retired to the Shannon View on Post Rd and enjoyed a really good Cape Ann Fisherman’s Dead Eye IPA, along with some Irish Faire.<br><br>
