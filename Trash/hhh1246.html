color=#000000>It is unaccountable that the RIH3’s worst runs attract the most 
hashers. Certainly, not enough of the new hashers fully understand the true 
nature of His Bodhisattva-ness (this means the hare, for those not far on the 
path of Bondo-enlightenment). Or can believe the warnings they have received. 
But the old-timers certainly should have known better. This is what comes of not 
having a life.<BR></FONT></SPAN><SPAN

color=#000000><BR>The hare was true to form. He exactly copied the <FONT 
color=#ff0000>DOB</FONT> trail from two weeks before. It takes something, I 
don’t know what, to do this and get away with it, all the while grinning like an 
imbecile. And when I say “like an imbecile”, I really mean he IS an imbecile. 
Unless you prefer moron. Or cretin, for that matter. But if the hare copies, 
then so does the scribe.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

An inevitable check fooled no one, and they began the ascent after crossing the 
stream on some planks. No shiggy, except a little snow was encountered. No one 
got lost. Trail led northeast on a path to the old ski lift. It turned right and 
went up the lift path at a steep grade. Some slipped a bit on the loose rubble 
under the snow. But that’s about the only interest this trail had.

heading straight up to the summit, one looping around to the right, and one 
heading left. WHO knows which was the true trail. It really didn’t matter. 
There’s not that much real estate up there. They ended up converging on the 
north ridge, where they found the hare and the beer check. Seventeen minutes to 
the beer! But, the hare had cut 25 yards off the trail from #1244, and had his 
beer stashed a little closer to the out trail.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

enough beer for the crowd. The singing filled the gap. This time, luckily, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> didn’t hear. He was probably off searching Catamint 
Hill for marks, not believing the hare could try to get away with a repeat, 
two-weeks later. Trail back came down the actual ski slopes. That’s really all I 
can think of to say. The circle was formed, the run rated, and not even the 
bimbos could save the hare this time. Total: -69! Visitors, backsliders, 
virgins, yada, yada. Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Shemale Man</FONT>. 
Finally, about half the group headed over to Woonsocket for some <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> Pasta and beer. What more can I 
say?<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
