</i></font></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Falling snow met the assembling 
hashers behind the Brooks Drugstore on Rte 1 in North Kingstown. It promised to 
be a fantastic hash, with the prospect of shiggy, freezing temperatures, and no 
bimbos. The hare was last to arrive; having set the last minute adjustments to 
what we would find out later, could have used a couple more. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Tinker was hobbling along, and 
promised <font color="#FF0000">Short Shorts'</font> delicacies at the OnOn. The 
parking lot was plowed clean, with pillows of snow lining the start of the 
woods. The hare gave additional directions, ignored by all, and the pack plowed 
over the snow and into drifts of briars seven feet high. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The hare had marked the trail 
using small squares with <b>H </b>printed on them. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>complained the entire time about not bringing his reading glasses and not 
able to see what they said. The remainder were happy to know
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>didn’t try the <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
method of marking in footprints, because as we searched along we often crossed 
our own tracks making the true direction confusing at best. The little H’s did 
their work, as we meandered yet further west into the state lands. This park is 
known around the state by its Indian name, Cocumscussoc, meaning ‘big briar, 
little joy’, called by the early settlers as Cum Suck It, thinking the big briar 
was between their thighs, and the gagging pain that went with it. Little did 
they know that that place was really on the Woonsocket and Cumberland line.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We made our way deeper and 
deeper, and the briars now towered over the trees, as each mile passed left more 
and more skin/clothing upon the brush. Till at last we found the beer. Nestled 
in the trees/briars, beside a roaring fire, on the edge of someone’s private 
property. Singing and drinking, louder and faster, until all the lights on the 
house were ablaze. Deciding that it was getting late and cold, we followed trail 
back out to Rte 1. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">As we made our way north 
towards the parking lot a mile away, a very pleasant man stopped to ask us what 
we were doing in his back yard? And did we think it was smart running around in 
the dark with hunters poaching everywhere? <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
stepped up to the challenge of explaining what we do, then <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font>, followed by <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. All failing terribly, as we explained to 
the man that we run through state parks, and he followed with “NO NO”, that is 
my property, “NO NO!”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, we guessed it would have 
been out of the question to ask him for a ride up the street, so we continued 
trotting along. A North Kingston Police vehicle followed closely, probably 
trying to protect us from the unruly locals. They’re as prickly as those damn 
briars. He followed us into the parking lot as was just waiting there, when the 
happy man drove up as we met late cumers <font color="#FF0000">Eager Beaver</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Muffalotto</font>. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Again he approached us trying 
to make crystal clear what drives us to do what we do, when Baxter, who had been 
extremely quiet up to this point, exclaimed, “Get the fuck out!” And he did.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We realized that
<font color="#FF0000">Surfin’ Sex </font>was out on trail, and since we were 
cold, hungry and hadn’t had a beer in 15 minutes, we decided to leave a map for 
him and go over to Tinkers.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">No fire to warm our cockles, 
but plenty of beer and the sweet aroma of Thai food cooking in the kitchen. We 
circled up, and gave the hare down-downs (2), because of his hat. We gave 
visitors one, and the hairy one showed us all her new doo. Neatly trimmed in a 
triangle, lined by smooth thighs and a beer belly. She also showed us her 
posterior and succulent parts. The phone rang, and <font color="#FF0000">
CompUsEX</font> was on his way, arriving minutes later, half-naked, pulled into 
the circle for a latecumer down-down.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Discussion followed about 
renaming the trimmed-bush one, but damned if I remember what it was. Hashit was 
kept by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and we sang religion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Short 
Shorts'</font> table was brilliantly set, with plates and spoons and forks and 
beer. The Thai food was served, and we attempted to keep the rice away from
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, to little avail. The singing and drinking 
and eating carried on into the wee hours, and as we left <font color="#FF0000">
Eager the bi-Beaver </font>exclaimed that she was going to get some with the
<font color="#FF0000">Muff</font>. The lucky bitch.</font></p>
