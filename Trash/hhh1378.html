WHO was not there? Well WHO was, but there were many WHO said  

they'd be joining us and decided to give it a miss. This caused 

an enormous amount of food and beer to be still available Sunday 

morning. Pat My Crevasse broke her kneecap and was in the 

hospital until Sunday. Pubic and Donkey were preparing for a 

wedding, Swamp Whine had to prepare for school, Mr Rogers left 

Gracie Basket and Pick Wrong Guy at home and traveled to 

California to get into some serious trouble. Wee Balls and Mrs 

Balls found something to entertain themselves in the bedroom. 

Crotch Tiger had to work, and Pussy Galore was sick with the 

sniffles. There were others too, but Fuwangii's absence would be 

felt most on the Sunday climb, but more on that later<br>
Weather: Perfect, cool night for sleeping, when we finally 

called it a day, and the day was perfect for a dip in the lake, 

even if it was a hike and a holler to get there.<br>
Hash Shit: Basket<br><br>
Who was first to arrive Thursday to prepare himself and the 

homestead for the weekend's event. Tinker, Short Shorts and 

Nibbles arrived mid-day and Dog Meat shortly thereafter. Then 

Basket, WIPOS, Amish and the remaining dribbled in during the 

night.<br><br>
Friday night was a blur. There was plenty of beer and Thai food 

to wet our appetite and get the juices flowing. I don't remember 

exactly what kept us up until well after midnight, but we all 

seemed to sleep in on Saturday morning. It was a lazy start, 

with lots of coffee, some danish and other pastry along with 

leftover Thai food. Walking outside we discovered two tents. 

Most of us found adequate accoms upstairs or in the great room, 

but Hairy felt more comfortable in a 3 by 3 tent. He had to 

sleep in the fetal position or have his head pushing the womb 

and his feet out the vagina. WIPOS had more comfortable 

situation. His tent was 10 x 20 and in addition to having a loft 

area, the bar and kitchen were well accented.
<br><br>
WHO left to drop off the beer and we started to gear up for the 

start about one. The start was about a mile away and most chose 

to start walking with just a couple lazy bastards hooking a ride 

with the hare when he returned. Directions were given and a 

warning that the bears were out so be loud and obnoxious. The 

pack was off, led by Basket, then Shemale, Hairy, Buttplug, Flo, 

and Amish took turns finding trail at the checks. Dog Meat and 

Pissonya decided the walk to the start was enough and there was 

plenty of wine at the camp, so off they went. Short Shorts and 

Nibbles stayed with WHO as he walked his way to the beer stop. 

Tinker was sweep.
<br><br>
Trail was mostly on trails, one identified as the Mail Road, 

used in the early days before email and traveled by horse, and 

many other logging roads or lesser trails. There were a few 

bushwhacks that caused more than a little confusion, especially 

since the amount of flour used to mark trail in the early going 

was becoming less and less, and two very important false trail 

marks were cleverly hidden behind a tree stump and rock. We all 

found ourselves at the end of a very long downhill falsie 

followed by a very long, arduous uphill along a ridge, where a 

cool breeze was just the trick to get us back up to speed. 

Luckily the beer stop was not too far off.
<br><br>
Just on the other side of a frog waller sat WHO and the pack, 

less Oozing, enjoying a cold one and orange food. The Thai 

ladies kept their shoes dry on the other bank, as songs were 

sung and we wondered if Oozing would find his way. He did 

eventually show and there was sufficient beer for all to enjoy. 

His complaints started straightaway, as the incorrectly marked 

checks and lack of flour was his main complaint.
<br><br>
We all took a glass for the road and started across the pond. 

The On In trail was mostly uneventful except when Hairy tried to 

jump on a fallen tree and wound up under it. It took some strong 

me to lift the heavy pine off him, but one would wonder if 

anyone would have stopped if we didn't have the beer with us. We 

all made our way back to WHO's for the circle, some in WHO's car 

and others enjoying the walk. To freshen-up, we took a run down 

to the lake, where some Ukrainian kids were just packing up. All 

decided it would be good to keep their shorts in consideration 

of the civilians on boats on adjoining lakefronts, but I 

promised Mudslut I'd wear the pink ladies bottoms she found on 

Buttplug's Hash the week before. Unfortunately there was a slit 

stratigicaly placed in the front where it may be easy access for 

a gentleman, but it barely held back my package, and finally 

made a splash just as I entered the water. Soon it was time for 

food, so we started the long journey back to WHO's.
<br><br>
WHO stopped by to pick up a few blocks of ice. He'll do anything 

to show his ass. Has he had a chance to look at it in the 

mirror? Disgusting! The circle was formed and he found his 

seat. Comments were mostly generous with a few truthful comments 

about the lack of marks, no bear sightings and extreme length of 

the trail. The rating was found to be a negative zero. Next 

virgins to Chocorua were invited to sit and Hairy, Buttplug and 

Shemale had an interesting time keeping two and a half large 

buttocks from sliding of the three 7 inch blocks. Next Nibbles graciously 

seated herself as a visitor, followed by a heated discussion as 

to WHOm would be Hashit. Since Shemale decided to keep it in his 

car, he thought he should keep it. Others were quickly 

nominated, but the honor fell on Basket, just because. Then it 

was time for the food to arrive.
<br><br>
The menu was enormous and tasty, from a couple Thai dishes, to 

meatballs and sausage, to Somosas and a few more that I don't 

recall. Beer was plenty and it didn't take WHO long to bring out 

the porn. It was a long movie with a plot about some guy fucking 

everything from porn starlets, to an African princess, to wives 

and daughters and eventually every woman in the show, including 

the one that eluded him in the beginning. This brought about a 

large cheer from the viewning audiance of Dog Meat, WHO, Hairy, 

Buttplug and Shemale. The rest of us had either fallen asleep or 

tired of the relentless pounding, despite the thought it was all 

fake at the beginning.<br><br>
One by one, each made his or her way to their bed and most woke 

to the smell of bacon and eggs with gravy. It was a proper 

breaky and one we could have used the day before to keep our 

energy up.<br><br>
A few of us decided to pack our climbing gear and try out a new 

crag not far from Conway. The book said the crag would be found 

uphill from a turnout and a short hike. I'm not sure if the 

previous days activities had us all tuckered out, the copious 

amount of beer and food, or in fact the crag was a long hike up 

a very steep grade, whatever it was, by the time we finally made 

it to the top, there was little in trad routes I'd be 

comfortable leading, so we drove back to WHO's for a beer and 

head home.<br><br>
