Amish laid this midday Hash in familiar territory, but safe from the maddening crowds. OOzing, OB, Just the Tip were already on trail as I arrived with food for the OnOn. I could see Amish and Meat Wallet just heading out as I positioned the food, a bucket of Hash Weiners, in the back of my car for later. It was almost 6:50 by the time I started out into the sand pits behind The Woods Tavern. I was distracted by a text from Just Pat, saying he was late and asked to make sure the checks were marked. Then I got a text from Clam DU asking if I could give a shortcut to the beer. Before I knew it, I was off trail and tried bushwhacking where I thought the trail would go. <br/><br/>
I hit some flour and then a few unmarked checks had me doing circles, I blew through some checks leading to false trails and went back to the checks again. I was marking the checks as Just Pat requested, so I couldn't just bushwhack to were I was sure to find beer. <br/><br/>
Eventually, I backtracked and followed the trail. I posted some Marco Polo's to help the latecumers, but WHO and O'Bone'r were having fun at my expense. Eventually, beer was found Â on the trail above the river, not near/on/or somewhere nicer, but the beer was cold and it was nice seeing a very preggy MW. Eventually, JP and ICfCDU showed and we sang a few ditties. Back in was straight forward, but not marked. MW went home and we circled in the open at some tables left our for us. The run was rated a 6.9. Basket got Hashit. We enjoyed warm weiners, potato salad, chips and beer. Not the best Memorial Day Hash, but it could have been worse.
