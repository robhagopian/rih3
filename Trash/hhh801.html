<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A setting sun greeted the peaceful hashers in
West Greenwich last Monday, marking the last peaceful run of the year.&nbsp; In
the first instance of that great Pakistani-American friendship, Hare <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
met the Yankee runners on his territory, in front of some long forgotten Baptist
Church on Rt 165. This location was safely beyond the <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> zone.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Bondo, PW, Just Susan, Sex
something</font> and (unfortunately) <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (Look at
me!)</font> were joined by visitor <font color="#FF0000">Potty Favor</font>, of
the Gaytona FL H3, and his local bodyguard<font color="#FF0000"> Jacko</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Jacko</font>
also bore a striking resemblance to Bodhisattva <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
rendering the hash in to a state of confusion right from the start. There were
also some walking- and nameless- virgins, who will be mentioned by name if they
show up again. Standby hashers <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr
Who</font> could not attend, as they were engaged in Rhode Island knitting
competition finals. Enema Bill spent the pre hash time complaining about his
car,<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> spent his time satisfying Jake.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On Out was called in the general direction of
Breakheart Lake, which may or may not be in Exeter. Dodging pungent piles of
horseshit, ( which many hashers thought was a cleverly camoflauged <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>),
up and down the dry trail past checks and balances and downed observation
towers.&nbsp; Dry trail continued into the woods without shiggy or delay, the
monotony broken only by the sound of our well coiffed visitor comparing the RIH3
trail to those found in some geriatric Florida community. This saga continued
for the duration of the run, with <font color="#FF0000">Just Susan</font> as the
audience, and <font color="#FF0000">Jacko</font> as the straight man. Luckily,
no voting&nbsp; took place. The trail eventually led to a small stream
surrounded by thorns, providing some shiggy for those who sought it, and some
blood for those who wanted that.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;At a convenient fork in the trail, the pack
was able to lose <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (Look at me!)</font>, who
decided he knew a better trail, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, who
decided to walk and blow his Shofar in private. Fortunately, we never saw <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
again. Unfortunately, we did find <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (Look at me!)</font>.&nbsp;
The meandering trail led out to the lake, a convenient piece of trail leading
clear around it. The Hare was seen laying fresh flour to guide the runners,
which prompted the Gaytona visitor to urge a group pantsing of the Hare. Oh
those wacky Floridians.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here the runners diverged. <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>,
<font color="#FF0000">Zoe, Sex Something</font>, and some other old fart (Look
at me!) led out around the lake, followed by <font color="#FF0000">Just Susan,
Gaytona </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Jacko.</font> <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
stayed put declaring &quot; let the beer come to me!&quot;.&nbsp; The artful <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>,
mindful of our H3 recruiting goals, failed to stop the walkers from taking the 2
mile tour of the lake. They are believed to be still out there, as faint calls
of &quot;Are You&quot; have been reported by DEM rangers.&nbsp; Ho hum around
the lake to the beer check, conveniently placed at the point at which the pack
had exited the woods. Harpoon, the Boston version of Schlitz,&nbsp; was offered
to the stragglers who came in. one by one, making this perhaps the longest beer
check in H3 history. Darkness rolled in during the check, as did that other
unpleasant surprise, the well clad<font color="#FF0000"> WIPOS</font>, who had
driven to the beer check, thereby avoiding the first 18 miles of this run.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Hare gave on back directions, assuming that
the pack would gladly run through unfamiliar trail without flashlights in hopes
of finding the West Greenwich/ Exeter border marker.&nbsp; Instead, the road
back was taken, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> leading, <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (Look at me!)</font> close behind, followed
by a group discussing the relative merits of Florida roads.&nbsp; While stalking
the pitch dark road, a car roared by this hapless scribe and his elderly
companion. We dodged into the woods, recovering in time to catch the license
plate of the car. Running through the laptop attached to Zoe's back, it belonged
to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, a fact confirmed a minute later, when the
slag stopped to pick up <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and return the
Bodhisatva&nbsp; to the cars. Wankers all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The extra long circle was joined, ensuring a down
down to our new ally <font color="#FF0000">OOzing</font>, the hashit <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
(for the drive by offense), and the Gaytona visitor for a lame story about his
naming. His bodyguard<font color="#FF0000"> Jacko</font>, was down downed after
answering the key question (What is the air speed of a swallow?), along with the
<font color="#FF0000">Sex something</font> guy.&nbsp; The run received a 6.9 ,
unusually high due to 1) the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>
and 2) the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill's ( Look at me!)</font>
bollocks dangling in the dust. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The On On was held at some South County
restaurant.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (Look at me!)</font> tried to
sing to the waitress and was asked to leave, although in his version of events,
&quot; They loved me&quot;. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> tried to shove
french fries up his nose, <font color="#FF0000">Gaytona</font> talked about an
especially wild gaytona hash that involved sheep, and <font color="#FF0000">Just
Susan</font> smiled through it all, like a Jr High school teacher chaperoning a
field trip to the Museum of Science. </font></p>
