<p><font color="#008000">Run #1089</font>, February 13, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Chester’s, Rt 44, Harmony (Glocester)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 20’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Amish It Head, Oozing SD, Justin My Ass, Trail Hoover (SESYB), Dry 
Foot Fairy, Bondo Jovi.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Here’s another crap write-up that really needs to be fleshed out by someone that remembers what happened that night. 
But like all <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> runs, the details are not very memorable.  The memories lie dormant, 
awaiting reactivation by some sort of external trauma. But <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cares. To awaken these 
horrific memories, to get what details I can, for the benefit of the Hash Trash and humanity itself, I have undergone 
hypnosis. I have utilized hallucinogen-induced ecstasies. I have resorted to electroshock therapy. All, to piece together 
any recollections about this particular hash, and to get this write-up over with.</p>

<p>What do I remember? I remember a brief bushwhack from Chester’s down to the Waterman reservoir. I remember the sound of 
ice settling and cracking as trail led along the shore of the reservoir, the thin ice at the edges breaking through to the 
sounds of cursing and whining. I remember quite clearly following the spandex clad posterior of <font color="#FF0000">
SESYB</font>, the only good memory I was able to induce. I remember entering a deserted summer cabin area, and losing 
trail, only to be brought back on the ice by the hare. I remember crossing Rt 44, and re-entering the woods, on some 
nature trails, finding an ideal beer check at a frozen waterfall, and I remember the agony of being told by the hare that 
this was not the BC.</p>

<p>I remember seeing the lights of 44 through the woods as trail led uphill into some sort of nursing home or retirement 
home or something. I remember the beer check being so unmemorable that I can’t really remember if we had a beer check. But 
remember, if there had been no beer check, THAT I really would have remembered. So there must have been a beer check. I 
remember getting back to Chester’s but I don’t remember how. Could it have been ENDLESS MILES OF PAVEMENT? Only the hare 
could remember that.</p>

<p>I remember a circle. I remember the hare getting his just rewards: <b>-6.9</b>! I remember <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> getting hashit. But these memories are not definite, only high probabilities. If they are not factual, this is 
how it SHOULD have happened. And, having written these memories, this becomes the reality. No matter what the hare says. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> has spoken.</p>
