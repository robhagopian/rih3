<p><font color="#008000">Run #962</font>, Sep 13, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing Syphilitic Dictaphone</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Pine Hill Rd, Carolina Management Area</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Low 70’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, Dr WHO, SESYB, Fuwangi Boner, WIPOS, 
Seamus, Ben.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The usual crew gathered in the late afternoon sunshine at one of the South County Management areas, still safe 
before the opening of hunting season. The hare was substituting again, so not much was expected. Not much was 
delivered.</p>

<p>Trail started off south along a road which bordered several active and inactive corn fields. At various times, trail 
led out to the east or west for a pointless loop; after everyone had individually fallen for this once or twice, these 
side tracks were ignored. The corn was a bit wormy. &nbsp;The trail led on to the southern extent of the management 
area and was easily picked up turning east at a check.</p>

<p>Easily picked up except for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, that is. He continued obstinately east when the 
trail turned back northeast and north. But the rest were pretty much together as they reentered the woods going north 
on the North-South trail. It was getting dark now, and flashlights came out. This may have attracted <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> back on to the trail. But it was no help to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.</p>

<p>After a brief (and straight) run northwards, a check sent the leaders to the banks of the Pawcatuck, (confused by 
some with the more toxic Pawtuxet River) where the hare had set his beer check on a moderate sized rock in the stream. 
He obviously is suffering from a case of <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>-envy. Wading up to the waist in the clear 
water, they crowded onto the boulder and tried to fend off Seamus and Ben who were very interested in climbing up to 
shake off on the group. Only <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was missing, so they doused their lights and tried 
to remain quiet. But the dogs betrayed them, and with two beers left in the cooler, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
finally arrived.</p>

<p>Beer gone and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> present, there was nothing to keep the hashers there. They got back 
on the NS trail, and continued up to the only challenging check of the evening, on a stone bridge crossing the river. 
Fuwangi continued straight. No marks.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>&nbsp; tried wading the waters west. Thorns, 
fallen trees, but no marks. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> found the true 
trail, backtracking northwest to a cemetery. Inside information? Maybe.</p>

<p>They all managed to extricate themselves from the woods, and made it back to Pine Hill Rd and to the cars. The 
circle was joined and the run rated: good weather, no shiggy, North-South Trail, no one lost, etc., etc., etc.! 
Total: -6.9. Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Why? Why not! After religion they (mostly) headed for exit 
6 not 6A and Marks, and there is nothing more to say.</p>
