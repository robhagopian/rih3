How Wipos Lost His Tail<br/><br/>

Back in the old days, Wipos had a tail which was his proudest possession. It was long and black and glossy and Wipos used to wave it around just so that Hashers would look at it. Basket saw this and was very jealous. Basket, as everyone knows, is a trickster and likes nothing better than fooling others. So it was that he decided to play a trick on Wipos. It was the time of year when Dr Who, the Spirit of Frost, had swept across the land, covering the trail with ticks and poison ivy on the trails with his big hammer. Basket made a hole looking into a Boy Scout camp restroom, right near a place where Wipos liked to set trail. By the time Wipos came by, all around Basket, in a big circle, were globs of hand lotion and allow tissues. Just as Wipos was about to ask Basket what he was doing, Basket twitched his tail which he had sticking through that hole in the restroom and pulled out with a big smile.
'Greetings, Brother,' said Basket. 'How are you this fine day?'
<br/><br/>
'Greetings,' answered Wipos, looking at the big circle of soiled tissue and spilled lotion. ‘I am well, Brother. But what are you doing?'
<br/><br/>
'I am wanking,' answered Basket. 'Would you like to try?'
<br/><br/>
'Oh, yes,' said Wipos, as he started to lumber over to Basket’s hole. 
<br/><br/>
But Basket stopped him. 'Wait, Brother,' he said, 'This place will not be good. As you can see, I have already scared away all the young scouts. Let us make you a new wank spot at the lake shower house where you can catch many young scouts.'
<br/><br/>
Wipos agreed and so he followed Basket to the lake shower room, a place where, as Basket knew very well, the lake shower house was not yet in use by the young scouts: which always stay closed till Memorial Day. Whipos watched as Basket made the hole in the lake shower room, already trembling over the orgasm he would soon feel. 'Now,' Basket said, 'you must do just as I tell you. Clear your mind of all thoughts of Boys. Do not even think of a song or the boys will hear you. Turn your back to the hole and place your tail inside it. Soon a young scout will come and grab your tail and you can catch him.' 
<br/><br/>
'But how will I know if a scout has grabbed my tail if my back is turned?' asked Wipos.
<br/><br/>
'I will hide over here where the scouts cannot see me,' said Basket. 'When a scout grabs your tail, I will shout. Then you must pull as hard as you can to catch your load. But you must be very patient. Do not move at all until I tell you.'
<br/><br/>
Wipos nodded, 'I will do exactly as you say.' He sat down next to the hole, placed his long beautiful black tail in the lake shower house and turned his back.
<br/><br/>
Basket watched for a time to make sure that Wipos was doing as he was told and then, very quietly, sneaked back to his own house and went to bed. The next morning he woke up and thought of Wipos. 'I wonder if he is still there,' Basket said to himself. 'I'll just go and check.'
<br/><br/>
So Basket went back to the lake shower house and what do you think he saw? He saw what looked like a big brier bush around the lake shower house. Briars had grown during the night and covered Wipos, who had fallen asleep while waiting for Basket to tell him to pull his tail and catch his load. And Wipos was snoring. His snores were so loud that the ivy was shaking. It was so funny that Basket rolled with laughter. But when he was through laughing, he decided the time had come to wake up poor Wipos. He crept very close to Wipos’s ear, took a deep breath, and then shouted: 'Now, Wipos!!!' Wipos woke up with a start and pulled his long tail hard as he could. But his tail had been caught in the Briars which had grown over during the night and as he pulled, it broke off : Whack! : just like that. Wipos turned around to look at the scouts he had caught and instead saw his long lovely tail caught in the briars.
<br/><br/>
'Ohhh,' he moaned, 'ohhh, Basket. I will get you for this.' But Basket, even though he was laughing fit to kill was still faster than Wipos and he leaped aside and was gone.
<br/><br/>
Wipos was so embarrassed, he went back to his hoopty and did not come out until that next Monday. So it is that even to this day Wipos’s have short tails, wank all winter, and have no love at all for Basket. And if you ever hear a Wipos moaning, it is probably because he remembers the trick Basket played on him long ago and he is mourning for his lost tail.
