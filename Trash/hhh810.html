<font face="Arial" size="2">Adding to the military spirit of the day, our own 
Pakistani decided that a little PT run through the night was in order. The Hare 
continued his streak of punishing long runs to bedevil the Hash, this time 
through the pleasant roll of his adoptive East Side.&nbsp; The pack was lucky to be 
at the Hash at all, since the Hare, in a further spirit of military secrecy, did 
not announce the directions until 5:30 that night. Despite his best efforts to 
throw us off, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO Slasher, Bondo (Bodhisattva), WIPOS, PW, Async, 
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> found the Benefit St love nest. The pack urged a quick exit at 6:30, 
before <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM)</font> turned up. </font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">Under cover of darkness (except for 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, clad in 
neon pinks and purples, and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, decked out in flaming yellow) the pack 
received instructions from the <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> one. Showing his true loyalties, he 
described Newport H3 hash marks, and substituted the European traffic signal for 
“ no access” for the conventional “check”. There were also some funny little 
arrows, but I digress.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">Down the hill to Roger Williams Park, where our 
spirits were shattered by the oncoming headlights of <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM).</font> Foiled 
again!&nbsp; Below the State House found the first strange looking check, as
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
scouted high, and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> scouted low. Governor Almond was not disturbed. Lt Gov 
Fogarty ran outside to shake hands and offer hot cocoa if we would please, 
please, please keep him in the only fulltime job he’s ever had. </font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">Slipping away from the mess, true trail was found 
along the river towards the morgue, where more puzzlement set in. 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had 
politely used chalk the same color as the sidewalk, so as not to alarm the 
authorities on the lookout for white powder. The camouflage marks were all the 
hash had to work with Even odder, since we were now across from the magic Shell 
station/car wash, where all kinds of white powder can be found by anyone willing 
to ask.&nbsp; Screams of “Kill the Hare” were cut off after two white-coated 
attendants rolled a gurney out of the morgue on Orms St and urged us to “ Do it, 
I need the overtime”&nbsp; </font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">The pack declined to send Oozing off to his virgins, 
and waited just long enough for <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>and 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to rejoin after their 
speculative sojourn behind the Old Registry Building. Not that there is anything 
wrong with that…………</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">On out exploring the check, including one trail 
followed by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and<font color="#FF0000"> PW</font> that was marked with an “F”. Assuming this to be “F 
for False” instead of ‘F for Fucking Idiot Hare” they retreated back to join the 
pack at the most logical point for the next clandestine chalk mark- across the 
intersection, up a hill and behind a mailbox.&nbsp; Very Zen. 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> had spent much 
effort searching the grounds of the windowless “ American Mathematical Society”, 
a CIA front if ever there was one. </font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">On out to N. Main and the loop towards Pawtucket. 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, sensing that he might know the true destination of the beer check, ran 
down the opposite side of the street. This was a good move, since 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> aromas 
were forcing the pack to fall further and further behind.&nbsp; 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> took up his FRB 
position with <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill.</font> <font color="#FF0000">PW
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>and <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> kept to the middle, while 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> took up the rear, stylish yet elegant in his pink arctic suit, with 
matching walking stick.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">Up the hills of the East Side we ran, following few 
marks until the pack got to Hope St. From there, it became a search and rescue 
mission, to find any marks that made sense. Alone and in pairs, the H3 moved 
through the side streets of a quiet neighborhood, which <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM)</font>, 
alerted to his presence by blowing his own horn. Now, into mile #5 of the hash, 
the speculation grew about this mystical beer check. Tortillas? Olivers? The 
empty field at the corner of Camp and Jenkins St?&nbsp; The Horror continued as 
<font color="#FF0000">PW</font> 
was left to run with <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM)</font>, dragging both Zoe and Baxter, who were so 
tired they couldn’t even sniff assholes.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> ran each mark to 
ground, while the Dr Seuss hat-wearing Hare was nowhere to be seen. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Arial" size="2">The scattered marks led the H3 down to Elmgrove 
Ave. and looping past Moses Brown where the odd shaped shadow of the 
<font color="#FF0000">Bodhisattva</font> 
fell upon <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EB (LAM)</font>.&nbsp; Placing him downwind, the three set off to a 
straight shot down Thayer St. The H3 pack descended upon the spoiled and selfish 
Brown U douche bags waiting for their Spike's junkyard dog. They had never seen a
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, smelled a <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, or heard an 
<font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM)</font>. They did, however, cheer 
for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> as he ran down the street, obviously mistaking him for Osama in a Dr. 
Seuss hat.&nbsp; Their two heroes together at last. </font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">At the end of Thayer St. the flour and chalk again 
disappeared, leaving the pack to scramble on towards Fox Point in search of the 
beer check. Separately, <font color="#FF0000">Async, Dr WHO, PW</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill </font>arrived at the circled 
B outside a completely dark house. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> stumbled in minutes later, again 
declaring that he knew exactly where the beer check was all along. Funny how he 
spent 7 miles getting there. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
<font face="Arial" size="2">The Hare soon arrived and announced that we were at 
the neighborhood Portuguese –American Club. After deciding that only 2 hashers 
(<font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>) actually have enough hair to pass as even part Portagee, 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
was sent in first, where he promptly declared himself as Azorean.&nbsp; He was lucky 
to get that far. In typical Portagee engineering, the dartboard had been placed 
behind the door used to enter the building! </font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">EverReady </font>took her place as the only woman in the 
bar, fending off marriage proposals that included dried fish as a dowry. 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
received an offer of a “ride on a boat”. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> lit up a stogie, if only to mask 
his own body odor. Enema Bill watered the dogs. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> regaled the barman with 
his knowledge that 70% of the worlds cork comes from Portugal. The walls were 
decorated with several pictures of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> (with crosshairs drawn upon him) and
<font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> in bathing suits.&nbsp; After a few quick pitchers, we exited as 
the locals started arguing about the upcoming Benfica vs. Sportu soccer game.</font></p>

<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> love lair, forming miles 7&amp;8 for the night. The Hare stopped to buy more 
Sammy Cream, since we had been out so long that his last batch had passed the 
expiration date.&nbsp; The Circle was held outside behind some pawnshop, much to
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> neighbors’ dismay. <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM)</font> received the Hashit, for leaving 
the Hashit in his car. Swing Low, and on up to <font color="#FF0000">Oozings
</font>lair for food.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> began stripping in the hallways, because they were “wet”. 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> from being 
the FRB and running the many checks, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> because he wore 8 layers of clothes

<font face="Arial" size="2">The highlight of the night was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> removing his 
shirt, which prompted <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> to flee after quickly losing his appetite, and the rest
