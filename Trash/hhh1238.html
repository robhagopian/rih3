color=#000000>Another Christmas season, another Fuwangi La Sallette run. After 
the swamp traverse last year, the hare had hoped that he could save on beer, 
through lack of attendance. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> would be stupid 
enough to show up for more of this abuse? Especially with six to ten inches of 
fresh snow on the ground. But show up they did, and continuing the disturbing 
trend towards popularity that the hash has had of late, in double digits. And 
not only did <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Ben</FONT> and<FONT color=#ff0000> Just 
Anna</FONT> return, but they brought another virgin, as well! To top it all, 
neither <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> nor <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> 
were present at 6:30!<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

color=#000000>Trail was marked in pink flour, hoping to confuse the color-blind 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. But it pretty much confused everyone else, as 
the marks were invisible, especially along the road. Trail started off south on 
Park Street. <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Shemale 
Man</FONT> led the newcomers (athletic wanks!) off into the distance along the 
road. They don’t need no stinkin’ marks! <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic</FONT> and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> followed for a while and then turned back to the 
last mark, at the corner of Maple St. <FONT color=#ff0000>Hairy Krishna</FONT> 
was trying this road, with no success. Finally <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
turned in the parking lot of an electrical supply store (the exit from the 
previous year), and found marks in the back.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>True trail led slightly west of south on a nice path, alongside a 
small pond and then out to a gas pipeline. Fresh footprints showed that the 
front pack had been this way, and trail marks were finally seen, heading west. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> caught up with <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>, 
and they followed trail as it curved south, and then southeast, circling a good 
distance from the lights of the Shrine. The rest of the pack was encountered as 
they approached the “Peace on Earth” sign. Finally, someone found true trail 
continuing into the woods south. A brief bushwhack led them to a path, and the 
Beer Check. Forty-five minutes to beer.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Yet again, the BC was marred by the presence of the late-arrival 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. This was partially mollified by the other 
late-cummer, <FONT color=#ff0000>Swamp Whine</FONT>. But a woman’s presence can 
only do so much. At least <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> had been scared away 
by last year’s run. The beer was shared, the Rhubarb refused to rise, and 
strenuous efforts were again made to ensure that the virgin, at least, would 
never show up again. Beer finally gone, the hare promised a whiskey check later 
in the trail. And they were off, again, backtracking back along the way they 
came.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail led towards the lights. It stayed in the woods, though, and 
the lead pack came to a field, sloping down sharply to the back access road for 
La Sallette. Downhill, they went. <FONT color=#ff0000>Shemale Man</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>CEP</FONT> were milling about 
with <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> holding 
back as they tried to find a mark. While this was going on, the rest of the pack 
came to the top of the hill. They stopped, suspiciously. What was going on? 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> knew right away, and led the group back up, for 
some whiskey, and a few more songs.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finally, the hare directed them on. They came into the Shrine 
itself. Some chose the Stations of the Cross. Some chose the prayer stairs and 
crypt. Some chose to ignore any marks that may or may not have been there. 
Somehow, those <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> chose not to run on pavement 
anymore, wound up in the parking lot at the northwest corner with the hare. 
Trail looked familiar. Because it was. Back on the nice path, alongside a small 
pond they went, until they came back out to the street, and the 
cars.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The circle was formed in the woods behind the dairy. Ratings for 
the run: another virgin, fine bimbos, festive lights and no <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> were powerful arguments for a good rating. But <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, pavement and no swamp countered this. Total +0.69. 
Two-timers were called upon, the virgin was deflowered, and sang. (Note to 
future virgin bimbos. We don’t mind seeing a ring or two. Or, for that matter, a 
RingaRangaRoo. As long as it’s not <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT>.) Hashit 
went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. And no, I STILL can’t remember why. 
At least this time I have no doubt it was deserved. Finishing up, it was back to 
Wetherlaines. And they even let us in, two weeks in a 
row!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
