<p><font color="#008000">Run #1059</font>, July 17, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Async</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Big River, West Greenwich, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 80’s, Humid</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom, Amish It Head, Just Travis, Tinker, Short Shorts, Fuwangi 
Boner, Dr WHO, Oozing SD, Dry Foot Fairy, Cum Under PSHS, WIPOS. Virgin: Just Bobby.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hare decided that creativity was over-rated, so he decided to set from a parking area on Rt 3 just past Burnt 
Sawmill Road. Maybe it’s a good thing. This run was more than a month ago. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> can’t remember 
the details? But after all, it is the most hashed area of RI, outside of Glendale. Big River. Where <font 
color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> set trail in the sand pits because they remind her of her childhood sandbox. Where 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> set in the recent logging-cuts, claiming virgin territory. Where <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> set from park-and-rides, for some queer reason. Where every time the <font color="#FF0000">Slasher Dr WHO
</font> sets: a dog is about to die. Where <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> sets in ponds, streams and any body of 
water, frozen or otherwise. Suffice it to say, hashers have been complaining about overuse of the area since at least 
1997.</p>

<p>The hare chose to mix it up a bit, and live-set the start. He has done this before. It usually means trouble. He 
mentioned that there would be a “T-E” split, and recommended against the “E”. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> listens to 
the hare?  After introducing the virgin brought by <font color="#FF0000">Just Justin(Travis)</font> to the marks, the 
group set off. To find that the hare had resorted to an annoying and infantile delaying tactic: a short loop east back to 
Rt 3. No one was fooled. They emerged onto the road, and crossed over Big River on a bridge. Not a few of them glanced 
wistfully at the shiggy beneath the bridge. While <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> carried on, the rest followed <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and the newcomers back into the woods south. They soon came to a “Turkey-Eagle” split. As 
usual, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> tried to convince the newcomers that it was a “Tough-Easy” choice. Being 
anxious to impress, they followed <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> down the “T” while only <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> were man (dumb) enough to go on the “E”. <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> continued to wander around, off trail.</p>

<p>The trail led southeast, winding around considerably. It was remarkable mainly for the lack of interest, lack of 
challenge, the lack of shiggy. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Travis(Justin)</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Bobby</font> led alternately, with <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> close behind. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> hung back to spend some quality time with <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>. <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short Shorts</font> walked casually and directly to the beer 
check. They came to Burnt Sawmill Rd and turned briefly southwest, then turned back west to some fresh logging trails. 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> now led, and came across the hare, toting a deflated raft through the woods. He helped. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> didn’t. Obviously, the next stop was the river, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
bee-lined for the banks and came across the BC. The beer was easily found by the time the hare and <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font>, and the newcomers arrived, soon followed by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short Shorts</font>.</p>

<p>It was quite pleasant for a while. A cooling pool, some decent beer, and no unduly annoying hashers present. The hare 
inflated the raft. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> helped. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> didn’t. But then, <font 
color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> arrived. Well, OK, a bimbo is always welcome. After a few beers, the hare began ferrying 
people across the river. This got rid of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Short Shorts</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>. Things were looking up. <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> even found a leech. But then <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived. Crap! Tales of 
bushwhacking prowess, virgin territories discovered, and manly exertion promptly followed, and were duly ignored. <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> arrived. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> arrived. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
arrived. This was too much! But at least they were finally out of beer. Eagle trail. Ha! They decided to move on. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Just Justin(Travis)</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Bobby
</font> and the rest for a swim, upstream 25 yards and then across to the flour marks on the far bank.</p>

<p>The trail back to the lot was straightforward and dull: well-marked and shiggy-free, they meandered north back to the 
parking lot and the circle. After a brief wait, they circled up. Ratings for the run: nonvirgin territory, missed 
river-crossing opportunities, insufficient beer at check, contrived boating event which may well have saved <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker’s</font> hips from rusting, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> from drowning, and no heat 
stroke deaths had to be balanced by a mere stream swim, a single, poor, confused leech, and the absence of <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Total <b>-0.69</b>. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for not being 
drowned. The virgin was queried, and probably sang something. But it was so unmemorable that your scribe cannot recall it 
even now, just two months later. Must have really sucked! They finished up and moved on to Rosie’s (formerly Mark’s). No 
doubt they behaved badly.</p>
