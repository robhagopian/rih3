Date: Dec 6, 2021

Hounds: WIPOS, Rusty, Just Pat, Butt Plug, Cracker Jackoff, OOzing. Basket and latecumer Hym Wrng Gye
Hare: Pussy Galore
PG set this trail alone, as Crotchy is lookin' more than a bit preggy. The weather was blustery but so warm. It felt more like mid-April than December, and with the promise of stronger winds and heavy rains, I'm sure Shine On had something to do with it. We learned of her passing just the day before, so this would be an opportunity to celebrate one of our favorite Bimbos, even if she was from Boston.
The directions to the start were vague and loudly complained about by Just Pat and Hym Wrong Gye. The rest of us found the start, as we've been here more than once and despite not being crystal clear, did not have a major breakdown over it. I pulled in beside WIPOS and was soon joined by Cracker, the Hare PG, Butt Plug, and finally OOzing just as Chalk Talk commenced. Hym Wrong Gye would arrive sometime later, complaining that he was at the other parking lot. Checking my phone later, he reported being late and was lost. Pathetic! A new mark indicating a dangerous drop off was introduced and we were off, crossing the road and mounting the horse trails heading north towards Sunset Stables. Butt Plug and Cracker were setting a frantic pace, with Cracker saying later that he got the first 8 checks correct. I struggled to keep up with them and wondered where the rest of the pack was. WIPOS was doing his usual hobble and OOzing, I guessed, was still changing into this track kit.
The trail was covered in dead leaves and concealed many puddles, horse manure and plenty of rocks to slip and slide on. We ran paralle to Quinsiquet Rd until we crossed it and worked our way out to Quinsiquet Pond. A good check had me looking for a Whiskey stop on top of the rockpile, but OOzing found trail going around it to the old burnt out hut. Here we enjoyed a couple nice single malts and relived some of our adventures with Shine On: Dancing topless around the fire on Bondo's floating iceberg, and OOzing and Bondo bringing her to tears on the way back from Pittsburgh H3. There were many other memories and we'd share they along the trail and at the Beer Stop & Circle. Just Pat was last to arrive before we left the W and it was just a short time later that WIPOS short cut to me on trail, missing whiskey.
Trail continued west to the ball fields and then southerly to Olney Pond. A good check had Butt Plug and I confused, and after checking out the other options, he found flour leading to the small penisula where Donkey and Pubic had a beer stop in the snow, many years ago. The B was found as I approached and bumped into Mr Rogers. We searched in vain, as the Hare hid the beer very well in plain sight behind a rock. She had to amost hold it up for me as it seemed to blend well into the leaf cover. I got a Captain's and JP was beaten by Cracker as he dug too deeply into the cache. The selection was very nice, with mostly New Hampshire brews with one 8.5 double IPA standing out. Songs sung, snacks enjoyed and beer finished, we ran along the paths, counter clockwise around the pond to the start. After replenishing her beer bag, we Circled up by the picnic tables.
Complaints rang hollow by MR. R and Just Pat about the directions, but the trail was well received. OOzing did an interesting bit, when, with a red light under his chin, had his body taken over by Shine On and did a pretty good imitation of her. With No WHO, Rusty, Bondo, JtT, Donkey, PH, and the other regulars, this well marked trail, horse shiggy and hidden rocks/water, and the interesting weather gathered a positive 069 rating. She sang, "Bring me some whiskey" after he DD. Next Backslider Hym Wrong Gye drank for his lack of consistency. Hashit was next and as the missing WANKERS should have received it, or OOzing for getting lost and failing to walk Shine On down the aisle at her daughter's wedding, it fell to me. I drank and sang a Pittsburgh song written by WIFF, "Half a Brain" As it was nearing the kitchen closing at the 2100 hour at The Lodge, OOZing, Butt Plug, Just Pat and I got in under the bell and continued our reminisce of The Tales of Shine On Harvard Moon, before heading home.Â
