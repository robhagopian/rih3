color=#000000>Another bike hash for <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, the hare 
whose laziness is by now a legend in the hashing world. But this time, perhaps, 
he hoped to repeat his triumph of getting <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> lost 
in his own backyard, on a bike! The group gathered at the end of Spring Lake 
Road, most with bicycles (although Oozing had two flat tires, which delayed 
things a bit). <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> were smart enough to: a) arrive early and scout out the On-In 
trail, and b) skip the biking thing.</FONT></SPAN><SPAN

by the hare. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> simply headed west on the On-In trail, and were able to backtrack 
to the beer check south on the west shore of Spring Lake without any difficulty 
whatsoever. Being unimaginative, they didn’t bother to alter the checks or marks 
in any way. Too bad. I am sure that if they had thought of it they could have 
had <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> irretrievably lost with a minimum of 
effort.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But they had saved their 
energy to find the beer, which took them quite some time. The area around the 
beer check had a ruined building, old fireplaces, steel drums, etc. All this to 
search! Too bad they didn’t think of the true nature of this hare. The beer was 
at the base of a tree not ten yards from the mark.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

heading west, and completely circled the lake on some roads. It seemed like 
forever, but they finally made it to the beer check. The usual excuses, whining, 
tall-tales, etc. came out. They had a swim. Beer gone, they followed the On-In 
trail. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> 
led, and even on foot were able to be first back because the bikers persisted in 
taking the wrong route at the checks. Finally, all arrived at the parking area,
