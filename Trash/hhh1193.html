even call this a hash trail. Because it was just an A to B, (more by good 
fortune than astute planning by the hare) on a trail newly opened by the 
Aquidneck Land Trust. So, if you want to know where the hare sent the pack, look 
up the Sakonnet Greenway Trail. I’m too tired to give details. Except that we 
went south. For the most part.</SPAN></P>

marks led south on the trail, got a little confused circling around the first 
field, and then rejoined the trail. They went south some more. On the trail. 
They crossed Braman Lane. They reentered some woods and turned slightly west. 
They crossed Mitchell lane. They circled a farm field and came out on East Main 
Rd. By now, the locals <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Rusty</FONT> had a clue, and headed for the Coastal Extreme 
Brewery, on Oliphant Lane. And found the Beer Check.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

even was kind enough to pile everyone into his “car” (which, being in a most 
disreputable condition, and unregistered as well, resulted in some evasive 
maneuvering when a Middletown police cruiser was spotted) to drive the hash back 
to the Glen. He even joined in the circle.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

rated. No shiggy, no bimbos (except for a cute brewery groupie at the BC), and 
clear weather were insufficient to outweigh the BEER CHECK OF THE YEAR! Total 
+6.9! Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>. Finishing up, they 
went on to the Coddington Brewery.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
