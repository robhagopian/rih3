<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>Sept 14, 2003</i></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>Dear Mr. Rhode Island Hash House Harriers,</i></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>I was given your name as someone of a position in trust 
in your country and am writing you to ask your assistance in a most delicate and 
impotent endeavor. I am Dr. Massif Oldongi WHO, the son of the former Prime 
Minister Dr Abusa Mawangi WHO of NIGERIA. Upon my late father's indubitable 
assassination in 1999, I and my two sisters Mabooty and Matwatty were forced to 
flee our assurient homeland and proceed to nearby BONDOLAND. We were able to 
escape with a portion of the contents of my fathers fortune, made by him 
honestly by breeding, herding, and selling the sacred OomeGoolie birds in the 
veldts of the Fugawi. As you know, their eggs contain a powerful and rare 
aphrodisiac much sought after by elderly and bearded brewers and runners. But I 
digress, and time is short!&nbsp;</i></font></p>

<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>This fortune amounts to TWENTY FIVE MILLIONS 
(25,000,000,000,000) of your US DOLLARS. Because of our special status in this 
land, we are surrounded by those who would steal our fortune and we have 
conceived a plan for our escape. We cannot risk bringing such a large and 
purulent sum with us. But, we do have access to the INTERNATIONAL NIGERIAN 
SUKKABANK. Our agent is prepared to wire from this bank the sum of TWENTY FIVE 
MILLIONS (250,000) of your US DOLLARS into a US Bank. Our problem now: to find 
someone to trust. We know it will be hard to believe, but we have heard your 
ineffectual praises sung across the broad Kalahari. We would be most grateful to 
you for your assistance in this important and inconsequential matterand will 
certainly expect that for you refforts, we would reinflate you with TEN PERCENT 
of this fortune, or THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND (19.55) of your US DOLLARS.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>&nbsp;These affectionate arrangements can easily be made. 
Please make haste to reply to this email with the following information:</i></font></p>

<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your current 
Bank Account Number</i></font></p>

Credit Card Numbers, and Expiration Dates</i></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Social 
Security Number</i></font></p>

School Locker Combination.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>We know that our missle might be viewed with some 
alchemic scepticism and we offer the following proof of our sensationalism: Our 
cousin, the Slasher Dr WHO will provide insurances for you if you doubt, Monday, 
June 16, promptly at SIX THIRTY (9:14) PM in TIVERTON, RHODE ISLAND. How, may 
you ask, do I gain receipt of these pruriences? Simply meet with our 
indefatigable cousin, and he will lead you On On into the dark night of NIGERIAN 
redemption.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>Dear Mr Rhode Island Hash House Harriers,</i></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>By this time you will have been in reception of a fine 
athletical event sponsored by our cousin, the Slasher Dr WHO, in fine Tiverton, 
RI. He has assured me that the trail was most facultative and will be rated the 
run of the year without exemption. He has forwarded to me the desecration of his 
run by one Oozing Syphilitic Dicktaphone;&nbsp; a distant cousin well known to the Al 
Qaeda branch of our family. It is as follows:</i></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3">Dr WHO again set the most brilliant run of the 
year. I am so envious, I could just spit. We started off at a parking 
lot/softball field and headed straight into shiggy across the street. A gas line 
right of way led west to the Tiverton Middle school and a nice semicircular 
trail near the Tiverton water supply. We zigged and zagged across the now 
northerly gas line, confused and admiring of the masterful checks, until we 
found a long bushwhack through briars to the FIRST beer check, knee deep in 
Stafford Pond. What beer! And fine Nigerian Spiced Peanuts! The best!</font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3">Next we continued generally north and west past the power 
plant, and into a maze of flooded lumbering roads. We got plenty wet, I can tell 
you. And SESYB likes it wet! We crossed under Rt 24 in a wildlife tunnel to the 
second beer check, featuring Storm King Imperial Stout (9.5% alcohol, woo-wee!) 
and more spiced nuts. All we could say was WOW MOM!</font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3">Next we ran a brief but scenic trail up the powerlines to 
the Park and Ride, where the hare brought out even more beer. We circled, and 
gave the hare a well-deserved 69! Hashit went to Basket as usual, and we all 
adjourned to the Li’l Bear for pizza and beer. I bet no one will ever top this 
one, oh my cousins!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3"><i>As you then most certainly can depreciate, our cousin 
the Oozing one has whereby given you complete confidence in our sincerities and 
obfuscations. We await the reception of your informations forthwith, and remind 
you indelicately of the fatuous nature of our transactions. It is indeed the sum 
of TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS ($25,000,000,000,000) that is a steak here. Once again 
our best wishes to you from darkest Africa.</i></font></p>
