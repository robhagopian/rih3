<p>These are the (unedited) d’erections by the hare for this week’s run. Not much more needs to be said, as these 
were the high point of the evening. The hare is obviously terrified that the Woonsocket police are monitoring him 
closely. Trying to keep legal, he set a pavement run through the city. He tried to make it acceptable to the hashers 
by setting two (not three!) beer stops. Bribery does work sometimes.</p>

<p>At any rate, those who showed up knew what they were getting themselves into. Most only came to find out if 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> had become an item after 
the last weeks hash. He was too much a gentleman to say, the wanker! Or perhaps he’s too much of a wanker to be a 
gentleman. Anyways they were off on time, east on the RR grade as usual. The trail led through some light snow, but 
was easy to follow as it turned uphill towards the powerlines. But it curved back west all too quickly to emerge on 
Cranston Street. That was the last of the “shiggy” for this night.</p>

<p>Heading north on the roads briefly, most blew past a well-concealed “B”. But they were called back, and entered a 
garage belonging to one of the hare’s relatives. Bondo brew was shared in the garage, but they waited too long. 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> showed up, following the odor more than the footprints. After a few, they 
relieved themselves in the bed of the hare’s brother-in-law’s truck. Then they set out again, continuing north and 
east on Carnation Street , Knight and Cooper Streets, etc. until they came to another “B”. This was the house of some 
of the hare’s “friends”, also home brewers. Some of their brews were sampled, and a few songs were sung in an attempt 
to offend them and alienate them from the hare. Then, on out again.  About 1 ½ miles had been covered at this point, 
with two beer stops. Grueling!</p>

<p>Trail was followed with no difficulty as the final destination was all too clear. Down the hill on Crawford to Park 
and then Front Street, crossing the Bernon Street Bridge they went. Gaps between them widened, depending upon how 
quickly they wanted to end this farce. As they passed Box Seats on River Street, they split into two groups: one led 
by <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>headed straight for the hare’s home. The other led by <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing,</font> was grimly determined to see this through, and follow trail. [Both groups were equally harassed by 
local teen hooligans, trying to get someone to buy them some Thunderbird. Ah, Woonsocket by night! What a place!] 
Regardless, they all pretty much arrived at the hare’s garage together.</p>

<p>Before the circle a few were driven back to collect cars, while <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and the 
<font color="#FF0000">Fairy</font> warmed themselves in the garage, and had more beer. The circle was finally sung 
to order. The ratings: two beer stops have a powerful effect on hashers. Added to that was the mellowing effect of yet 
more beer on those who had not returned for their cars. But it could excuse the extreme, willful, and repetitive use 
of asphalt only so far. Total: -6.9. Next Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> can’t remember; probably 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Finally yet another disorganized attempt at renaming: suggestions for renaming 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> to “No Head”, “PeckerHeadless”, and “Something’s Rotten in Groton” were 
considered, settling provisionally for the last. Pathetic! They moved upstairs for <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font>-chili and more brew. All in all, another wasted evening, except for the anticipation of the excellent 
bowel-cleansing to come from all this homebrew and chili.</p>
