the run was marked by the early arrival of <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo 
Jovi</FONT>, always a bad thing. Not willing to wait for 6:30 to roll around, he 
had a beer, took out some flour and amade an arrow pointing towards Bryant 
University. This fortuitously proved to be exactly the wrong direction. And then 
he was off, finding true trail across Rt 7 on a dirt road heading northeast. The 
hare was late in arriving, and didn’t notice the arrow. Fun 
times!<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"

off, as soon as they could pry <FONT color=#ff0000>Friar</FONT> and <FONT

northeast through the woods out to Essex Street, then turned east up to the 
small bridge (previously a beer check in happier times). <FONT

class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The 
remains of Hanton City consist of several stone foundations, a burial site, a 
defunct dam apparently used for irrigation, and a dilapidated scattering of 
stone walls, typifying it as a standard small New England farming community. The 
entire site is completely overgrown, making it nearly impossible to locate when 
any vegetation is present.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">At 
the time of its habitation, the small settlement was extremely isolated from the 
main town of Smithfield. For this reason, several theories have been posited in 
regards to its raison d'être.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The 
first theory is that the residents of Hanton City were a small band of runaway 
slaves united to live in secrecy in the wilds of then extremely rural 
Smithfield. This theory seems unlikely given the logistics of a renegade group 
of people's ability to procure the building materials and basic supplies needed 
to create even the most rudimentary settlement (let alone the outside goods 
required to maintain day-to-day life).<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The 
second theory is that the residents of Hanton City were all pariahs afflicted 
with a communicable disease that mandated their isolation from the general 
populace. The third and most likely theory is that those who founded Hanton City 
were Loyalists: colonists who remained loyal to the king of England during the 
American Revolution. It is uncertain whether these Loyalists were forced to live 
in exile by the historically fiercely independent Rhode Islanders or whether 
they chose of their own volition to form an enclave of the politically 
like-minded. Several Tories from Newport were exiled to Smithfield and Glocester 
in 1776, including Thomas Vernon whose diary was 
published.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

Well, the trail did not take advantage of the Lost City. As far as these hares 
were concerned, the city will remain lost. But the beer did not remain lost, and 
the group reached the Beer Check, near the gas pipelines. Beer was opened. 
Meanwhile, back at Parentes, <FONT color=#ff0000>JIMA</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT> and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> were getting more and more lost in the 
brambles near Bryant. Note to hashers: if you arrive late and see a flour arrow 
anywhere near <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo’s</FONT> car, be very, very 
skeptical.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Finishing up, 
trail back was straightforward: south to the pipeline and out back to Rt 7. They 
circled up behind Parentes. The run was rated. No virgin territory, but a 
powerline (always a treat). No <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, but <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! No <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT>, at least 
on trail, but also no <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT>! The whines of 
those that had chosen <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo’s</FONT> guidance settled the 
issue: +0! <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Kathy</FONT> was named: “<FONT 
color=#ff0000>Clamcakes</FONT>”. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> remembers why? 
Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, of course. The On On On was at 
Parentes,&nbsp;where the beer may suck, but the waitresses pants are tight and 
their thongs are microscopic.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
