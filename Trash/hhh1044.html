<p><font color="#008000">Run #1044</font>, April 3, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Trail Hoover (SESYB)</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Mid 50s, clear.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Oozing, Basket Boom Boom, Dr. WHO, WIPOS, Great at Giving Head, Dry Foot

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Since I wasn’t really prepared to do this write-up (when is a hasher prepared to do anything though?) I’m choosing to 
do this in the form of a first-person narrative.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> can contradict anything I write if it 
was never vocalized and only present in my head (<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> said head?).  Ok, enough of that –let’s 
go.</p>

<p>There it was on Monday, the start of another workweek.  I managed to get up on time despite screwing up AM/PM on my 
alarm clock.  The drive into work was lightly-traveled and easy.  My cup of coffee was especially flavorful and I was 
actually, gasp, productive at work.  It was a great day!  And a hash too!  Can a Monday get any better?</p>

<p>Some reasons behind my attendance were the wonderful weather, additional sunlight, proximity to my apartment and 
promise of at least one bimbo on trail (there were a total of three, a Monday CAN get better!).  I assume <font 
color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> showed up expecting the sandpit to lead to the ocean.  As for the others, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows?!  One thing I do know is how shocking it was to see everyone’s face in the light after 
months of anonymity.  Yeah – how about postponing the start of the hash until sundown from now on?  OK.  Thanks.</p>

<p>After an explanation of the marks for the visitors we blasted across Division Rd into the adjacent sandpit.  I head 
right at the first check (a long, long way from beer), the rest of the pack heads left.  Of course.  After a few seconds 
of waiting, the wailing horn of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> calls us on towards the west.  A few checks later I 
end up at a sand hill, only to see <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> carrying a plastic disk sled towards the top.  
Unfortunately I miss any attempt by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> at going down, but do see him and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> pull <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> on the other side.  Gritty enema, anyone?!  
Strange enough <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> appeared to enjoy it.  I assume he enjoys being manhandled by multiple 
men and being left with a soar bum.  Trail lead straight up another large sandhill, but those of us smart enough to go 
around followed an oddly-glassed figure ahead of us.  Is that U2’s Bono?  No – it’s <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>!  
FRB?  With no bike?  Unpossible!  Those super-duper yellow glasses managed to pick up a few marks and he lead us 
southward into the woods.</p>

<p>This is where things became fun.  False trail marks – check.  False trails marks that don’t mean false trail and lead 
to the real trail – check.  Two of those puppies had us back into an area where it looked like Rhode Island was 
clear-cutting the forest.  Eh, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> needs trees?  Actually, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
needed a radiator fan, and found one in the rubbish.  He tossed it like a pro (what else is he good at tossing?) and I 
(<font color="#FF0000">Amish It Head</font>, remember?) picked up a hose and placed it in my crotch, thrusting for all to 
see.  Good times, good times.  There is nothing funnier than a dick and fart joke.  As <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and I proceeded left at a check <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> proceeded right, which was the wrong way but <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would call 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> back?  Not us.</p>

<p>A quick hop over New London Turnpike had us walking up a hill that’d just been mowed down by what must have been the 
most gigantic of gigantic lawnmowers as trees and branches littered the path.  What a great place to be a beaver!  As the 
mighty <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and I 
forged ahead via a half circle jerk we come to the top to see none other than the hare.  Short cutting wankerette!  What 
the rest of the pack was doing back there I have no clue, most likely indulging in some sort of twisted, sadistic, dirty 
group freak-fest.  I’m sad I wasn’t invited.  A little bushwacking led us over Hopkins Hill road and onto a path around 
the littorals (not to be confused with clitorals, as the latter is much cooler) of Tarbox Pond and finally to the 
beercheck.  Being intellectually superior to my fellow hashers I was first to find the brew.  Mmmm.  A tasty red from 
Trinity.  Unfortunately the others were quick to show up so I had to share.</p>

<p>With the pack huddled around the beer Basket started off with a song when all of a sudden he was interrupted by a 
flash of yellow streaking through the trees.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>?!  Impossible.  That makes two weeks in 
a row!  Not long after, a sorry pair of wankers (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and long-lost <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>) showed up as well. Brokeback Sand Mountain anyone?!  Realizing this would most likely be 
the largest Rhode Island hash of the year the group proceeded into a multitude of songs.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> tried see-saw’ing with himself on a nearby log (better than anything else he could be doing by himself).  The 
bimbo visitor, <font color="#FF0000">Oval Orifice</font>, was treated with a rendition of “pubic hair.”  And <font 
color="#FF0000">Hoover</font> was almost treated to her favorite of songs.  Once the beer was consumed the group left 
towards the west and split up at another clearing.  The smart half going directly to the road, me being stupid enough to 
follow <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and the trail in towards the woods again.  Soon enough all ended up on Hopkins 
Hill road and after a short jog ended back at the cars.  By this time it was getting dark and a nice lady in a Jeep came 
into the parking lot to tell <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> she could not see him from behind.  How could one NOT see 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> from behind?</p>

<p>Yadda, yadda, yadda, I carry a bucket ‘o beer across the road back into the sandpit.  With a clear starry night, a 
fairly warm air and a bucket ‘o beer how could I not be happier?  The group circled up.  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker
</font> told us the story on how the sand got there (not really – just why it was out in the open, although he is old 
enough to tell us how it showed up to begin with).  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> carried the new spare-tire hashit 
around like it was meant to be his.   <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> talked about how there had been a parking lot 
present at the location not too long ago trying to impress us with his wits.  Mind you, I said “w”its.  And the rest of us 
waited for the night to be over.  Comments included: too much shiggy, not enough sand, good beer, three bimbos, <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> dressed for rain when none was to be found.  Mathematical total: <b>+0.69</b>!  Hashit was 
initially given to <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font>, but after an amazing wrasslin’ match with <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> she managed to escape sprinting to the street.  Stand-in hashit went to <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.  For what reason?  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cares!  After what felt like hours of 
songs the cars were packed up and we headed to Mark’s.</p>

<p>Only problem – Mark had a sex change operation and became Rosie.  Showing up to the remodeled Mark’s (aka Rosie’s), we 
weren’t sure if we’d fit in, or the food would meet the hash’s high standards.  All the worrying was for naught as the 
menu had not changed and the IPA and Guinness flowed just fine from the taps.  Food was ordered (including a Mark’s 
burger, which had now become a Rosie’s burger), the waitress was annoyed and non-stop singing ensued.  The visitor’s were 
given a RIH3 shirt by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, which they appeared to appreciate.  Evidently they didn’t see 
the pictures of his antics in Boston the other week.  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was loud and proud and everyone 
enjoyed their sippy-cup sized beers.  Viva la hash!</p>
