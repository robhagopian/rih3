<p><font color="#0000ff">The 
Run:<br><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">A large and unruly crowd gathered just off 146 in 
North Smithfield, despite the fore-knowledge of <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> as hare. Visitors and virgins! And females! What is 
this hash coming to? After brief instructions (excuses!) by the hare they were 
off. And almost immediately confused. Trail was finally indicated by the hare, 
going southwest to Pound Hill Road, and diverging off on a path. Several checks 
were mastered, mostly by <font color="#ff0000">Sloppy Thirds</font>, the visitor, 
who figured out almost instantly that if she took the path away from <font color="#ff0000">Justin My Ass</font>, she would be correct 90% of the time. And 
all checks led uphill on Woonsocket Hill (a mighty 586 ft in altitude, but the 
lazy hare couldn't bring himself all the way to the summit or lookout tower. 
This is the problem these days. Lazy hares. And not enough beer. And poor 
hygeine. But I digress.)<br><br>The rest followed the noises ahead, except for 
the very slow who were able to follow the hare as he shortcutted through the 
woods as trail turned west then north. The leaders came out on Pound Hill Rd 
again. There was more confusion. Asphalt does that to us. After a few false 
starts, <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> 
turned down Taber and re-entered the woods. The pack came together as they came 
out on Industrial Dr, and turned northwest. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> tried 
a shortcut in an attempt to avoid the pavement. He was successful in finding 
some prime shiggy, but not the trail. <br><br>Trail was found by <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#ff0000">JIMA</font>, turning left 
up a driveway, and then back into the woods. It paralleled the road, and then 
crossed through a drainage pit to the north side into 
a</font></font></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> tractor trailer parking lot. Flour was scarce yet 
again. But this was territory familiar from the most recent Xmas hash so <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#ff0000">JIMA</font> led <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Amish </font>across the 
RR tracks, down past some half-demolished buildings to a path going east along 
the river. This path was flooded. Finally, some shiggy. But virtually no marks 
to indicate that crossing was necessary. There was sufficient hesitation to 
allow <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> to catch up and lead across, up to the 
gonads in freezing water. Flour finally resumed and the pack made their way 
to the 146 bridge to find the BC and... <font color="#ff0000">Async</font>! The 
bastard!<br><br>The beer was already open, and the singing began. Nothing 
inspires the RIH3 like the combination of: a) bimbos, B) virgins, g) virgins 
that are bimbos, 4) underbridge acoustics and #) no <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>. (He had arrived, but had been unwilling to follow 
Async. He had beer in the van. Can you blame him?) Thus, a prolonged songfest 
began. Finally, the visitor showing signs of ear strain, they packed up and were 
on out. Trail led parallel to 146, southeast. The lead group of <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi </font>and <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> entered the 
Halloween trail of the (now defunct) Homestead, got distracted by the scary 
ghosts and things, and ended up bushwhacking through the Homestead grounds 
(swamps) back to Pound Hill Road. </font></font></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font color="#ff0000">Async</font> led <font color="#ff0000">Sloppy</font>, <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Just Melinda</font> and <font color="#ff0000">JIMA</font> on 
true trail with the hare, avoiding the pavement (and the swamps). At the cars, a 
dreadful odor soon made it quite clear. <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> was 
there.<br><br></font></font></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">After a brief convoy, the circle was joined at 
Basket's house. Ratings for the run: Bimbos, Shiggy, No Bondo at BC vs 
pavement, no Virgin Territory and <font color="#ff0000">Async</font>'s annoying 
shortcut to the BC. Total -0.69. </font></font></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Hashit (through tortuous and incomprehensible 
reasoning, but with complete justification on moral, intellectual and religious 
grounds) to: <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>. The food was brought out, and to 
finish off the evening, <font color="#ff0000">Dogmeat </font>demanded pornography. 
So the prize present from the Xmas hash was unveiled, and they finished off the 
night with a screening of that 70's classic "</font></font></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Flesh Gordon".<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =
