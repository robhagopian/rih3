<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 800th Run of the Pre-eminent Hash in the
civilized world:<br>
The Incomparable, Oft-Imitated but Never Equaled Rhode Island Red Cocks Hash<br>
House Harriers. (For Newport: September 3rd is also the 66th anniversary of a
record-setting in bowling: 2652 points in 10 games bowled by Andrew Varipapa.
For Boston: Sept 3, 1981 was the date of the Longest game in the history of
Fenway Park, 20 innings Boston v. Seattle. Guess who lost.)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF">The Run:
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As per the hare's instructions, the day began
with the Opening of the Keg Ceremony, promptly at 11 AM. The keynote speech by
former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was a
heartfelt and emotional tribute to the brave hashers of Rhode Island. President
George W. Bush, simulcast live via satellite from the parallel ceremonies in
Austin TX, was heard to resoundingly endorse the speaker's words and to make his
own congratulations by offering the services of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms to the Rhody Hash at any time. After the 21 gun salute, the
ceremony was over and preparations were made to greet the numerous visitors, who
began to arrive soon after the dignitaries had left, at about noon.<br>
<br>
The hare's d'erections had stated that the run would start at Bella's restaurant
at 1 PM. Therefore, most of the hashers showed up at 290 Snake Hill Road, hoping
perhaps to avoid the run and get a head start on the keg. When it became clear
that <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font> was not about to start any &amp;#$@!
cooking until the *&amp;@#$! hashers got off their #$%&amp;@! arses and did the
@%$#&amp;! run, the group reluctantly got up and walked or drove over to the
restaurant just in time for hash instructions. Instructions for turkey and eagle
trail alike were shouted out in a most unintelligible manner by the hare in the
center of the circle; about the only thing clear was that the marks were to be
&quot;H3&quot;'s for the eagles and shamrocks for the turkeys. (Nothing but
sparsely set shamrocks were seen for miles to come, confirming the expected
incompetence that the RIH3 counts on from our hares, and suggesting that anyone
who willingly set out on this trail was a true turkey.)<br>
<br>
The run started heading west on the Bronco Hwy, crossing the branch river for
the first and dryest of the estimated 17 river crossings of the afternoon. Then
trail led north briefly on Joslin Rd, turned west through the gated driveway of
the Glendale Sexual Prosthesis Factory and into a briar patch. Northwards the
pack ran, into Branch River Park through poison ivy, over fallen trees, and
along cornfields (stripped bare hours earlier by the rapacious and ever-frugal <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
Jovi</font> for the meal following the run). The group led by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
SD</font> encountered a river crossing where the hare had thoughtfully provided
flotation devices in the form of styrofoam Surfboards to ease the crossing for
some. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO </font>paddled
across the mighty seven inch-deep flood comfortably on their bellies. <font color="#FF0000">Surfin'
Compusex</font> showed his form, hanging eleven downstream on a high curl until
he ran into an abandoned shopping cart, flipped over into a pool of fetid mud,
and disturbed several small trout into&nbsp;swimming up his shorts where they
thought they saw an even smaller companion. &quot;Kowabunga,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was so enamored by the Branch River that he
spent much of the run going upstream and downstream, pointing out the clever
submerged &quot;H3&quot; marks to whomsoever would pay attention to him. This
was too bad because as a result, he missed some of the only mud on the trail,
which provided minutes of simple pleasure for the rest of the RIH3-ers who
rolled about in the warm muck making unusual noises and rhythmic pelvic motions
of uncertain significance. But where the RIH3 GM (Jake) leads,</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Images/800/RIH3GM%20cropped.jpg" alt="Our illustrious GM, Jake!" width="242" height="321"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">the rest follow. From the mud, a falsie was
straight, and true trail was discovered to the right, entering a warren of
shiggyless trails ultimately leading back to the river, crossing, crossing, ever
crossing, crossing back to an abandoned mill foundation, at last to the river
where the final crossing was made in water up to four feet deep. Suspicious warm
patches were encountered yet again near <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and
the hare. In addition to the &quot;H3&quot; marks under the water, the dastardly
hare had submerged several attractive &quot;scratch-and-sniff&quot; stickers,
which, at a depth of three feet resulted in the tragic near-drowning of several
Boston Hashers.<br>
<br>
Trail now led west, crossing roads, and passing confused property owners into a
portion of the Black Hut Management area. Going up hill, a unnamed harriette was
stung by a mud wasp, prompting a rapid and complete physical examination by the
crack RIH3 medical response team. When asked if she reacted to bee-stings, she
replied that she had never been stung before, proving her allegiance to the
Newport Hash. At the top of the hill, the turkeys, led by <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>,
had been making serious inroads in the beer at the beer check as the eagles
straggled in. The beer check was formed around an ancient and mysterious ring of
stones wherein was carved in Nordic runes still faintly visible: &quot;Eller spørsmål
kan til redaksjonen&quot; (or, loosely translated: &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
a dope&quot;). Songs were sung: the RIH3 pondered how to get their rhubarb to
rise, and provided visual aids for the Wild West Show; and <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> continued to show her wistful fascination with necrophilia.<br>
<br>
The beer was finished, and the hare gave instructions for the return to the
on-on-on with admonitions for the eagles to turn left at the 'T'. Down the hill,
heading south they went on trail for a short period. Half the Bostonians became
lost, as following the hare's instructions they went looking for the subway
station, searching their jock-straps for tokens. The rest struggled out of the
woods near the Burrillville Middle School, crossed Bronco Highway, went through
a homeowner's prized dahlia patch back to the southeast. They passed a large man
in his underwear tending his tomato plants, and the quick-thinking hare
explained that the runners were sufferers of an unusual form of &quot;running
somnambulism&quot; and that he was a researcher with a substantial federal grant
to study this disorder. &quot;Whatever you do, DON'T wake them up!&quot;
expostulated the hare. &quot;They don't look like they're sleeping,&quot; said
the man. However, he became convinced when the hare pointed out that when
running, a snore comes out sounding something like &quot;on on!&quot;<br>
<br>
Crossing heartbreakingly dry mud, Victory highway and the last remnant of the
Branch River, Snake Hill Road was followed to #290 by runners at risk of being
run down by hashers returning from Bella's in their cars, many of whom showed
savage disregard for others by speeding, not wearing seatbelts, improper use of
turn signals, and speaking on cell phones while driving and performing
self-abuse at the same time. The first arrivals jumped into the pool while
awaiting the down-down ceremony. The hare stated that he kept his pool
exceptionally cold in order to better view the nipples of the few brave harriettes
who had jumped in. <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat,</font> his wife, provided a
more rational explanation: as <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>would
inevitably end up naked, the pool water would limit the damage done as a natural
effect of 'shrinkage'. Now we know why his rhubarb refuses to rise.<br>
<br>
The circle was joined around an ice throne, immediately occupied with glee by
the hare.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Images/800/Hare%20small%20size.jpg" alt="The hare enjoying a frostie" width="384" height="305"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Comments were generally favorable given the
festive nature of the occasion: 9F from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 'not
enough shiggy', 'too much pavement', 'lousy weather', 'too much nudity', 'too
little nudity'; the overall score: +0.69. After a almost completely tuneless
rendition of a song written especially for the occasion by the hare: &quot;My
Own Marvelous Toy&quot; sung by the RIH3 &quot;Tone-Deaf Sextet&quot;, the hare
moved on and called for the renegade/backslider <font color="#FF0000">Deep
Throat</font>.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Images/800/Renegade%20cropped.jpg" alt="Welcome back, Deep Throat!" width="360" height="292"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;She assumed the position on the ice,
although refusing to accept the risk of having her skin come in contact with the
toxic residue left by the ice throne's previous occupant, she kept her shorts
on. Another new song for the &quot;ramblin' b*tch&quot;, and it was on to the
hashit.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, yet again a victim of unseemly jealousy
and rank envy from his hashmates was placed on the throne to choose the hashit
(where, by the way,&nbsp; his clydesdalean and fiery hot hindquarters threatened
to make short work of the ice). Choosing the obvious victim for the hashit was
quickly accomplished, seconded and finalized. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
took his seat, protected by thermal kevlar and thinsulate hash armor as always,
for the simple crime of coming dressed for action and not making the actual run.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Images/800/RIH3Hashit%20cropped.jpg" alt="RIH3 Hashit WIPOS" width="250" height="309"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Next came the visitors. Seeing that with
visitors in the center almost no one was left in the outer circle, this did not
last long, so the cermony proceeded to the virgins:<font color="#FF0000"> Murph
1</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Murph 2</font>. These identical twins had
thoughtfully provided a way to distinguish one from the other: one wore a
heliotrope wig while running. Unfortunately, since they both gave only their
last name, it was of no use ultimately. It was decided to treat them as a single
organism, provisionally known as <font color="#FF0000">Smurfs</font>. And, after
a few minutes on the ice, parts of them began to reach the appropriate purple
hue. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> asked questions: They got their names
confused, chose incorrect favorite colors, thought the square root of 69 was
8.3, and their favorite sexual position was 'cheek to cheek'.<br>
<br>
After 'swinging low', the group moved on to the on-on-on with pasta, chili and
other delectables provided by <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font>,&nbsp; and
corn (provided by <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> and the impecunious <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>).
Numerous breaches of the peace followed with ice bombings in the pool, <font color="#FF0000">Wintoes
69's</font> interesting experiments in underwater hat propulsion, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket
Boom Boom's</font> effort to scandalize and humiliate the long suffering <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat
</font>by parading around naked in front of his children and mother-in-law. Your
scribe would apologize to our visitors on behalf of the RIH3, and invites all to
return at any time, although you'd better not expect any improvement on<font color="#FF0000">
Basket's</font> part because he, through years of self-abuse, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>beer, and poison-ivy inhalation, has a short-circuit in his brain and
that's just the way he is, God love him!<br>
<br>
Congrats to the hare, his wife and the RIH3 on an outstanding event!<br>
<br>
On on<br>
