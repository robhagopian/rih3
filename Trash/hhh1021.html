<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">At last! The Real 1,000th T-Shirt Run.</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1021</font>, October 24, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Durfee Management Area, two miles north of Rte 101, although it seemed a 
lot further.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High thirties, drizzle with trace of snow, quite dark.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy, Amish It Head, Dr WHO, Tinker, Dik Dok, Basket Boom Boom, 
G@GH, Oozing SD, Bondo Jovi, Async, Seamus (disabled but game as ever), Ben (collarless and stupid as ever), and virgin 
visitor Just Sandra.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Missing:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner, SESYB, Beyond Hope, Just Areola.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>It was dark, rainy, cold, bloody awful, and Wilma was 500 miles to the south. Makes you cringe at the thought of a 
direct hit. Well, maybe not – a good hurricane might cause millions of dollars worth of improvements in Woonsocket.</p>

<p>Regardless, a bumper crop of Rhody Hash were there not only for the run, but for the 1,000 run T-shirts, goody bags, 
and fabulous OnOnOn with punishment of the mismanagement. Unfortunately, there were no mismanagement present, as they had 
all died when <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> passed away a few weeks ago. It transpires that <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> had decided that this was the 1,000th, but despite spending all of his spare time poring over Rhody Hash 
records (pathetic), he never discovered the truth.</p>

<p>You see, when <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> took over almost exactly ten years on a similar dismal October night, 
he was not only erected Grand Master (HMWGMH), but also Hash Cash, Trailmaster, Hash Scribe, Hash Music, and Hash Horn. 
He promised never, never to let <font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD</font> succeed him. He did delegate Hash Horn to <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (<font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> graciously let <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> be 
Hash Horn’s Ass), and permitted <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> do the odd 
write-up. Of course, <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> edited the write-ups and deleted all references that demeaned 
dogs. Especially the time at a beer stop when he tried to bugger Sweet Molasses on the edge of the cliff. (I’m not sure if 
bugger’s the right word.) <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> did explain that he became overly excited when the hash broke 
into “Beastiality’s Best”.</p>

<p>Perhaps that’s why <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> reformed, and later created CLAW (Canines and Lower Animals of 
Woonsocket). As head of CLAW, <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font> was vigorous in his pursuit of dog’s rights.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, once again, there were no 1,000 run T-shirts as CLAW had refused to let a caricature of their former 
leader be paraded in public on a T-shirt. So that was that.</p>

<p>Further unfortunately, a non-male visitor did show up expecting a T-shirt and other goodies, only to express her shock 
at not seeing <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font>, and her dismay at seeing us “Is this a men’s hash? It IS a men’s hash! I 
think I’ll throw up!”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> quickly moved in and skillfully used his bedside manner to assure her that we once 
had a female run with us, and in addition offered her a 50% discount on her next colonoscopy. The visitor was obviously 
not about to be seduced until she could see the color of his endoproctorectoscope. <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> next 
stratagem was to indicate <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> as a literate, respectable, upper middle class type who never 
molested women and never complained once about not having a 1,000-run T-shirt. Needless to say, this hadn’t a snowball’s 
chance of working.</p>

<p>Just then <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> appeared with woman to woman reassurances. Visitor to Dick Doc: “Can 
you keep me as far as possible from that disgusting person with a condom on his head and smoking a filthy cigar?” (That’s 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> role. He makes all of us look good.) Further to <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> 
“I’m not sure I want to do this anyway. No 1,000-run T-shirt, and I’ve never run in the dark woods with people like this 
before.”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> somehow sensed that she was a virgin. He then pre-empted the hare’s role and used 
flour to explain in two seconds the intricacies of trail markings. Brilliant! Casting a confused backwards glance at the 
drool running down <font color="#FF0000">G@GH’s</font> chin, and giving up thoughts of a 1,000 run T-shirt, she screwed up 
her courage and went for her flashlight.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> got himself in position right behind her, but as luck would have it, his bulb 
burned out prematurely, and he had to return to the car park for a spare. He never saw the pack again. In a vain attempt 
to shortcut, never a good idea in the woods at night, he was within earshot of the pack when stopped by a cliff that 
dropped into a swamp. Fortunately, there appeared to be an open field across a short stretch of swamp. Unfortunately, the 
open field turned out to be a large bog. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was thinking of the 1,000 run T-shirt he 
might never get to wear.</p>

<p>Let’s leave <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> there and catch up with the rest of the pack. <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> was swearing at Ben. Shamus was swearing at <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was short-cutting, trying to lure the visitor into a trap. <font color="#FF0000">Dick 
Doc</font> was alert to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. Checks were solved by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, 
with an assist from <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>. It looked too easy for <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was sweating inside his Kevlar four-season protective running gear, thinking maybe it wasn’t 
virgin hashing territory after all. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> was hoping <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
would do the write up. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was hoping <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> would.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> was late. So he curled up in the back of his car not caring who (<font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>) did what, just patiently waiting for a beer and a clean cotton 1,000th run T-shirt when the 
pack returned.</p>

<p>And they eventually did return, as they always return. Going through forests like brush hogs, slamming through shiggy, 
fording raging rivers, sprinting down back roads to a graveyard beer stop, a little well-earned necrophilia (<font 
color="blue">"Rhode Island Cemetary Glocester #69"</font>  ..no kidding!), and then the On-In sprint. Wet, cold, full of 
wheat beer and farting. Hashing doesn’t get much better than this. The only thing better would be to be receiving a 
multi-colored, high quality cotton 1,000th run T-shirt.</p>

<p>The hash circled up far away from the Woosocket Police, but it was a listless circle once it really sank in that there 
would be no multi-colored, high quality cotton 1,000th run T-shirt with a pocket on the sleeve. The run got consistent 
<b>6.9</b> ratings as the hare swiveled on his steel-toed running shoes to face each accuser. The hare was invited to 
sing, but <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> forgot the words (to his own song). The visitor was invited in for a drink, 
and she remembered Battle Hymn of the Republic. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> remembered the words too long and 
easily retained the hashit. It began spitting freezing rain as we swung low, and headed for . . . . Bentley’s!</p>

<p>NOT Cadys! There was some consternation – we didn’t know there were any other bars in the hills of northwest Rhode 
Island up to our standards. After confusing Glocester with Cranston, the hare got the right directions out and we headed 
for Bentley’s, not Cadys. The visitor didn’t know where the airport was so she also headed for Bentleys.</p>

<p>Bentley’s turned out to be warm, featured live music almost as good as the Hash a cappella choir, the pizza was well 
catered by the place next door, the Herpes beer and the I-Pee-A were plentiful, <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> 
harmonica fell apart when he was invited to jam, and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> tried for (but missed) the 
all-time high OnOnOn cost record. With <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font> missing, very few foreign objects got into the 
beers. It would have been absolutely perfect with a multi-colored, high quality cotton 1,000th run T-shirt with a pocket 
on one sleeve and your name on the other.</p>

<p>NB: Posted on the web site Tuesday: “What an awesome hash for this virgin until 10/24/05 in rhode island. It was worth 
it and I want more. love s” “More” obviously meaning the multi-colored, high quality cotton 1,000th run T-shirt with a 
pocket on one sleeve and your name on the other. Definitely half a brain and total lack of taste. <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font> just could be a just perfect Rhody hasher.</p>
