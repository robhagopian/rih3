This is my story and I'm sticking to it.<br>
Start point was a Middle School in Swansea MAThe date was March 19th, a mere two day’s after St Patrick’s Day“The Hare was WHO”, you ask. The response is, yes he was.Those present included WHO, Basket, Fuwangi, Ass Quack, Crabby Shag, DOB, Tinker, Flounder Pounder, Rusty, Pussy Galore, Crotch Tiger, Dingleberry, Just Mark, Just Garrick, Just Kristen, and Just WIPOS. All of the aforementioned names were written on the back of a place mat for Jillian’s Pub, so that’s probably where we ended up after the circle. Pitcher’s of beer anyone??? <br><br>
Once again, I find myself adding words to my Microsoft word dictionary. WHO would have thought that Bill Gates wanted Dingleberry to be Dangleberry, and Basket is Gay.Any road up, enuf of dat as they say somewhere. WHO was just back from a road trip to see HMD in PA and set a trail that included a “W” stop, the infamous James O’ Sullivan brand of whiskey known only to those that look for bottles with Irish Boxers on the label. The trail itself could be referred to as meandering; it resembled a really old river, without the water. Shortcuts were the order of the night, but the thorny bushes soon made it obvious that one should follow the real trail.The song of the evening was “Sunshine Mountain”, it was nice to hear it from the mountaineers the first time, alas they kept on singing it like a broken record and even managed to convince other goats to climb up and join them. Follow this link to see a version that is way better than the rendition we saw  HYPERLINK "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPPW7cwPRxI" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPPW7cwPRxI  <br><br>
This begs the question, when have you ever seen a hyperlink in a hash trash?? Could this be the first? How sad !! The main mountain climbers were Tinker and Basket, they sang at the same time as the pack at the beer stop. The big issue here was the fact that the beer stop was a mere turty feet from the wankers on the rock, the newbies were not impressed and were surely looking for an escape route at this stage.Little did we know it but Fuwangi was way behind us, it was getting dark and those blatantly obvious marks in the middle of the field became less obvious as the darkness took over. He apparently meandered across the field, eventually found a dry beer stop and then made it to the circle.Said circle was held on the edge of the pond, much rejoicing was had, songs were sung, lies were told and an important announcement was made regarding dragon boat practices this tursday at 6. WHO was congratulated for run of the week, Tinker was welcomed back, the JUSTS were introduced, and Rusty was given the hashit because the vote was rigged.
