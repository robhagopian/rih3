<p>This hash ended up being a who’s <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> (and yes, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> is who) of 
the RIH3, with the whole crowd showing up – minus our bearded northern buddy <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, of 
course.  It seemed like it’d be a great time.  Lots of friends.  Lots of sun.  A virgin and a visitor.  And looking at 
Google Earth, lots of water.  What can be better?</p>

<p>Hare’s directions had the group pull into Box Seats for the start, which just happened to be pretty darn close to the 
shoreline of Woonasquatucket Reservoir.  If there is anything the hash knows from past reservoir runs it’s that you’ve got 
two options.  One – run counterclockwise.  Two – run clockwise.  Three (oh, I guess there are three options) – grab 
yourself an inflatable love doll and float straight across.  Unbeknownst to us, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had 
picked a fourth option – the counterclockwise reservoir to clockwise non-reservoir hash.  Brilliant!  I think.</p>

<p>First few marks led us to believe that trail left southwest out of the back of the parking lot into a hill/ditch/pack 
of logs and briars.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> went down.  Some others followed around the corner.  Some 
others sat there and watched.  In the 5min it took for the group to realize something wasn’t right <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> had blazed a path at his normal snail’s pace northwest after receiving a tip (although not THAT kind of tip, 
you sickos!) from the hare.  The pack soon caught up and proceeded along a path on the edge of the reservoir, heading in a 
counterclockwise direction.  The virgin/visitor forged ahead at the speed of light.  The rest of the RIH3 wasn’t 
impressed.</p>

<p>Luckily (haha!) for the group, Mother Nature had unleashed the flood gates and allowed massive amounts of rain to fall 
the previous weekend.  This ensured a few things – that the reservoir was full, that the path along the reservoir’s edge 
was flooded, and that it was likely that poo and other septic system overflow managed to make its way up from underground. 
 That last one can’t be confirmed, and thinking back it was most likely <font color="#FF0000">G@GH’s</font> rectum that 
emanated the stench.  Multiple transitions from dry path to wet path were made, with <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and the virgin/visitor forging ahead.  At one point a 
check was passed and all continued blindly along the reservoir’s edge, although the mistake was quickly realized and a 
u-turn brought us back on trail.</p>

<p>A climb uphill through briars put everyone into a small industrial park, but after a little pavement pounding dirt was 
found once again.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was ahead?  Actually, it wasn’t <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, it 
was <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  Both late.  And <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> knows for what deviant reasons.  Trail led back into the woods past a make-shift paintball field down towards a 
running stream.  Some crossed, some did not.  It didn’t really matter as both groups followed water upstream towards Forge 
Rd where a quick cross had us in a small park where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and Seamus were waiting after 
catching up from behind.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> hammered uphill and the virgin/visitor ran at the speed of 
light.  Once again, the RIH3 wasn’t impressed.  Where <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> was during this whole event is 
a mystery.  Earlier comments ranged from “this is awesome!” to “I think after all this water I can hare my whole hash on 
pavement next week.”  A check was encountered at the top and while some of the pack went left, <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font> went right managing to find true trail which continued for a short period of time before making a tight 
right-hander downhill, and then a tight left-hander at the bottom forging into the woods.  Some bushwhacking occurred and 
trail led into yet another body of flowing water, this stream being belly-deep on most, boob-deep on a lucky few.  
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> is not a part of the lucky few.  A quick in and out (<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
couldn’t use one of those!?) had everyone regrouping in a parking lot on Farnum Pike.</p>

<p>After the stream crossing, trail led north on Farnum Pike and then made a quick right turn onto Rolger Farm Rd.  
Uphill.  Up lots of a hill.  The stream crossings and reservoir circling started the hash off on a good foot (which is a 
combination of “a good note” and “the right foot”), but the combination of pavement and uphill roads left a lot to be 
desired.  Lucky enough this stretch of crapiness was short lived, and a right onto Brenton led us to a quick left onto a 
trail along a set of power lines.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was FRB, with <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and 
the virgin in hot pursuit.  Soon after, trail led onto the practice field at Bryant University.   Unfortunately no field 
hockey coeds in pigtails, short plaid skirts and knee-high socks were to be found.  Not that anyone in the RIH3 would like 
to see such a thing.  Flour marked a trail leading towards campus and only a bit of confusion occurred near some practice 
fields where various whistles from coaches tempted the hashers towards their direction.  A few smart (haha!) hashers 
managed to find trail downhill and called on the rest, who were still standing there listing to the whistles like a deer 
in headlights.  All proceeded through a wonderfully manicured grass field where a little Sound of Music skipping occurred, 
and quickly stopped , prior to entering the woods through a rough trail.</p>

<p>Hallelujah!  The beer check!  All were present except for <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font>, and all were hoping 
that the hare would have to go back in search.  Of course this would only occur after the beer was consumed so cups were 
filled and songs were sung.  Not much after the party was started <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> came around the 
corner, much to our surprise, and much to our disappointment as it meant <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> would now be 
able to continue with us to the end.  Also much to our disappointment, he’d managed to find the most mosquito-populated 
section of woods to hold the check in, so all were swatting and swinging.  Who would let the insects get a free 
beer-filled blood sucking!?  Not <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>!  <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> even found a 
tick, and was quick to say “NO” after <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> offered to check her over for more.</p>

<p>Once the beer was finished up the group headed back out, following trail through the woods until it popped out onto 
Farnum Pike just across the street from Box Seats.  Someone thought it’d be a bright idea to take a picture (scribe has 
“cleaned up” said picture to remove any inappropriate material).  Everyone teetered in slowly and once together, a cooler 
of beer was brought down to the reservoir for the circle.  All entered except <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font>.  
Actually, all showed up but <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font>.  Brilliant!  <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> 
stripped down to her skivvies and got wet (and how – I’ll let your mind wonder) just prior to the ratings.  Something 
something something.  Mathematical total: <b>-0.69</b>!!  I think it had to do with lack of shiggy, mosquitos, 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> at the beer check and all the other regular complaints.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> kept throwing the wooden toilet seat hashit into the water for Ben to chase.  Unfortunately Ben came back each 
time.  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> due to his continuous blabbing about the World Cup.  As the sun 
set over the water the beers were finished and everyone went back to the cars to get changed prior to dinner.  All enjoyed 
food, but none enjoyed pitchers as they were $20 a pop!  One more hash down, if you’re smart – no more to go!</p>
