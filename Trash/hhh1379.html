Cookout at West Greenwich
Hare: Shemale Man<br>
Pack: Basket, Dog Meat, Pack My Crevasse, Oozing, Amish, Hairy, Luxury Box, Butt Plug, Flobanger, Rusty, WHO, WIPOS and Mrs WIPOS along with a few from a place long long ago: the Fat One and Short Shorts, Friar Fuck and his new dog, Bung Hole and her husband, with visitors Shemale Man's Sister and Male Friend <br>
Weather: Pleasant<br><br>
As is usual for a Shemale Hash, the directions left a bit to the imagination. Fortunately, most of the regulars found the start along with a few unfortunate from our past and others from the other state. <br><br>
The pack of about 8, WHO drove the dusty dirt road 2 miles out in East Japipi, Bumfuck, met at the bridge that was a mile before it should have been. Beers were shared and complaints ran rampant. 6:30 came and went as more dust was seen in the distance thinking it would be Crotch Tiger. Unfortunately it was only OOzing so we started out promptly at 6:37. CT would not be seen, as she got tied up in a traffic jam and decided, intelligently, that she might take a miss.<br><br>
The trail started out easterly along Plain Road, but soon took a right onto a trail towards the infamous Stepping Stone Falls. Since Basket has personal knowledge of the area, he let the pack , but soon discovered his alzheimers was kicking in and was alone again naturally. The pack continued along a well marked trail, for RIH3, and soon encountered some civilians, walking with children and on horse back.<br><br>
We all eventually found our way to the fall, somewhat disappointed as the loss of rain recently left little to fall of the stepping stones. But as is expected, a good check had half the pack running smack into the other half of the pack cuming back in the opposite direction.<br><br>
Backtracking, we found the Hare and the beer at the trickling falls. Songs were sung, beer was enjoyed and discussion ensued of a missing OOzing. Soon sounds off in the distance of OOzing along with Bungy and Husband, found on trail, followed by WIPOS and Mrs, and Rusty, WHO complained about the directions and the GPS sending him on a road to nowhere.<br><br>
Beer was gone so we made our way back to the start. About Half way we encountered the Fat One and Sweet Molasses and then Friar Fuck and pup. Eventually all made it back to the circle, in the river, under the bridge. Down-downs were shared with the Hare, His sister and male friend, visitors Fat One and Sweet Molasses, Friar, who forgot he was holding his dog's leash when he walked into the water. <br><br>
We decided to go to Breakheart Pond for the cookout and most found their way the 2 1/2 miles back along the damn dirt road. Shemale pulled an old grill out and started heating up his kabobs and stuffed peppers. Then out of the dust cums Dog Meat and the crippled Pack My Crevasse. Soon the wheel chairs were taken out for the WC races. Rusty cheated, Butt Plug was magnanimous, but they were both winners. Awards were given for WHO knows what, and we ate the semi-cooked chicken on the stick.<br><br> 
Then we went home....that was it.
