<p><font color="#008000">Run #1130</font>, Nov 26, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Concrete Feet</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Autumn Run/Wolf Hill, Smithfield</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 30’s, drizzle and fog.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; WHO, Amish It Head, Basket Boom Boom, Fuwangi Boner, WIPOS.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> returned to haring after many years of avoiding the task (and the hash, in 
general). Nevertheless, even with years of not setting a trail, he proved himself more than up to the task. The trail he 
set might rank with the top five trails of all time! (Of course, we’ll never know since no one, including the hare, 
actually ran his trail that night. I, as always, digress.) But to be fair, it was cold. It was wet. There was a dense 
fog. Almost no one showed up. With this kind of luck, anyone can set a memorable trail. A few minutes after 6:30, the 
few dumb enough to show up were off.</p>

<p>Trail went briefly on the road away from the police station (a good thing!). The hare pointed out a left turn, up the 
hill at a bare patch. The group was briefly together as they bushwhacked east, and then came to one of the Boy Scout 
trails in the area. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led east, with <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> following (how 
quickly they forget Rule #1: NEVER FOLLOW <font color="#FF0000">BASKET</font>!). <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> turned more south. They were convinced that the beer check would be at the 
waterfall in the Wolf Hill Quarry, but not seeing any marks, they stuck more or less with the hare. Even when it became 
clear that the hare was lost. (Proposal for Rule #2: NEVER FOLLOW <font color="#FF0000">CONCRETE FEET</font>!)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Baske</font>t had made it to the powerlines. The fog was 
even more dense. They turned briefly north. No marks! They met latecummer <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. They 
turned south hoping to lose him. Meanwhile <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> had 
reached the powerlines with the hare. At this point, they turned to the hare for guidance. He recommended the southerly 
route, and suggested that there was trail on the other side of the powerlines which should lead to the beer. There was 
in fact trail on the other side of the powerlines. But it was unmarked. And the nearest beer in this direction was 
probably in the “Applebys” on Rt 44.</p>

<p>The hare stated that the BC was near a transformer station. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> both knew of the station near Mountaindale Rd. so off they went. No beer was found. They 
questioned the hare more closely. He said that the beer had been stashed near a transformer station that he had reached 
by walking on a trail parallel to the powerlines, with the powerlines on his RIGHT. And further, his trail had NEVER 
crossed the powerlines. Using navigational, geometric and logical skills honed to a fine edge by years of getting 
hopelessly lost, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> pointed out that this meant the beer lay NORTH, not south as they had 
been travelling for the better part of the last hour. Feeling that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had likely found 
the beer by now, and not wishing to listen to him crow in triumph, they decided to head back to the cars. They turned 
west on Mountaindale Road, and re-entered the woods near the quarry.</p>

<p>But <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, true to form, had not found the beer. He and <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> wandered around aimlessly on the powerlines, and then headed down by the 
quarry. They just missed the hare being led by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
along the reservoir path back north to the cars. Finally all together they moved into the woods within a rhubarb’s throw 
of the police station, and circled up.</p>

<p>The run was rated. Beer Checks have been missed before. Beer has been stolen, or too-well hidden etc. But never in 
history has a hare become so totally lost that he started searching for his own beer check almost TWO MILES from where 
he had left it! Colossal! Stupendous! That plus fine fog, minimal (intentional) pavement, and no <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> was enough to ensure a fine rating: <b>+6.9</b>! Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> for 
persistently and willfully following <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Finishing up, and slightly disappointed in the 
level of vigilance exhibited by the Smithfield Police, they drove off to Effin’s for the On On On. This event was marked 
by a sober, subdued and quiet presence most unlike the RIH3 at its usual level of maturity. Maybe we should skip the 
Beer Check more often. Or, NOT!</p>
