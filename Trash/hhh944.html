<p>Your scribe cannot better describe the hash this week than simply to copy the hare’s immortal d’erections, straight 
from the guestbook. No changes have been made.</p>

<p><i>hey fellow ass wipes Bondo has once again cume up with a spectacular run this monday. virgin territory I do say 
Virgin and there will be at least one virgin there. the run will start at duche face's house. you ask how do I get there ? 
simple asso get in your car. Follow the road to Rt 7 towards burryville and about 3/4 mi before the western Hotel take a 
left( that is if you are cumming from providence) onto Tarklin Rd and follow that all the way to the end. When you arrive 
at the end of Tarklin Rd you must take a left if you go right you must be Jesus Christ becuase the bridge is out and you 
will have to drive over water. Any way take a fucken left onto Cooper Rd ( no sign) and go about 3/4mi to Barberfarm Rd 
h3 sign will be posted look for big white house 1 of 3 take your choice you have a 33% chance of being right... On On

<p>With a beginning like this, who needs to run?</p>

<p>The usual crew of misfits arrived at the rural home of a major backslider <font color="#FF0000">Face Douche</font>, 
who hasn’t been hashing because of some lame excuse involving multiple cardiac arrests or something. But at least he threw 
open his home for the hash. Slightly late (because of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi </font>having trouble with the bridge being out) they set out into the woods southeast through <font 
color="#FF0000">Face Douche's</font> backyard. There was a surprising amount of flour for a <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> run, and they pretty much stayed together. It was mostly bushwhacking at first, with some good poison ivy and 
briars for all.</p>

<p>Trail turned west and entered a swampy area with a flooded path. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi, Basket </font>and 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>stayed on trail with the hare, but <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> found that they could avoid the shiggy by following the sounds of trail up on a ridgeline 
parallel to the others. The hare began whining about not following true trail. They came out into an abandoned quarry. 
Most of the day-old marks had been blown away, but the hare was thirsty and gave several hints that had the hashers 
continuing through the base of the sand and gravel pit west and south to a check mark just before Gazza Road.&nbsp; 
Some slight confusion arose, but the trail was found by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi </font>doubling back north along the western ridge of the quarry to the beer stop.</p>

<p>They gathered above a small quarry pool for some <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>-brew, almost completely exhausted 
from the grueling 0.9 miles of trail they had crossed. The stagnant water was a fertile breeding ground and the mosquitoes 
were out in force, so it wasn’t a total waste. After a few songs, the hare directed the group to continue north, warning 
that he had mislaid in a few areas. What else is new? They left the quarry behind and came to a network of paths. <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi, WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> chose one alternative ending to the hash, and 
emerged on Cooper Hill Road 300 yards north of Barber Farm Road. <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> chose another, and proceeded directly to <font color="#FF0000">Face Douche's </font>backyard. 
The hare chose a third route, and got lost in the woods. Your scribe cannot make this stuff up!</p>

<p>By the time the bedraggled hare struggled out of the woods, most of the hashers were beginning to feel the effects of 
the many beers they had had while waiting. The circle was joined and the run rated. Virgin territory, mild to moderate 
shiggy, hare lost by himself on his own trail: 6.9! The backslider was punished, Hashit was given (to <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>?). And finally, they moved up onto the deck where <font color="#FF0000">Face Douche's</font> 
wife had prepared a feast of grilled burgers, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> chili, salad etc. They ate well and, 
feeling the effects of excessive beer with less than 2 miles of trail, sang the longest version of the Rhubarb song in 
history, along with several other classics. The Burrillville (sorry: <i>burryville</i>) police were called by the 
neighbors, but they couldn’t find the house either. So the evening ended successfully. Just another manic Monday.</p>
