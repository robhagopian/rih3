color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> can remember anything about this run, except for the 
record number of bimbos! It was almost like a real hash! And even though <FONT 
color=#ff0000>G@GH</FONT> almost ruined it by making a cameo appearance, there 
was NO <FONT color=#ff0000>BONDO</FONT>!! Starting from the J. B. Hudson trail 
in Arcadia, the pack headed north on the trail for a time, then began a 
bushwhack west. No one was fooled by the checks, there was no shiggy, and there 
were no points of interest except for those fortunate enough to be running 
behind a bimbo. Typical hash.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The virgin, 
brought by <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, was a runner. So she kept in the lead 
of the pack, much to her chagrin. The trail led across Frosty Hollow Rd, and 
continued west. It dipped south and then came out onto another dirt road. True 
trail turned north. The pack went south (except for <FONT color=#ff0000>Dr 
WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> who chose right (wrong) at 
least temporarily. The pack found the marks after coming upon an arrow that the 
foolish hare had left at the end of his foolish and unnecessary loop. Typical 
hare.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Crossing 165, 
they turned east an uphill to the beer check. As the stragglers rolled in, the 
songs started. There is nothing that inspires singing like a virgin bimbo. So 
it’s doubtful we will ever see her again, that’s for sure. But the beer was 
good, the trail was short and what else is there to do on a Monday night? On 
back to the cars, the hare had laid a carefully thought out and I’m sure a 
shiggy-filled trail certain to please. So the pack took the road back, ignoring 
the trail. Typical pack.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNoSpacing><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The circle was 
formed and the run rated. Multiple bimbos, no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, 
short trail, and the hare’s discomfort at having over half his trail skipped by 
the hash more than made up for the clear weather, lack of shiggy, and 
reappearance of <FONT color=#ff0000>G@GH</FONT>. Total: +6.9! The virgin was 
questioned, got nothing right and did not show her ring, despite continuous and 
unseemly pleading by the pack. The backslider was punished and the Hashit went 
to <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT> for not bringing <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT>. The on-on-on was at the Black River Tavern, 
but the virgin finally showed some commonsense by not attending. It was karaoke 
night. If you were not there, you can probably imagine how THAT 
went!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
