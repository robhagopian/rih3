01-11-10 is the same backwards and forwards. And so was the run, more or less. 
But I am premature. (Doesn’t matter, as long as I’m happy.) The large crowd 
gathered with keen anticipation, only to be crushed when <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>arrived. What

marks were found, proceeding south, behind the high school, and into Meshanticut 
Park. It almost looked like there was going to be some virgin territory. But 
they were soon back on the road, heading south on Phenix Ave. The leaders<FONT

color=#ff0000>Just boys</FONT> continued south, crossing 295, followed by <FONT

wank!) found the arrow in the slush leading onto the 295 median island. Trail 
led north, through the light snow.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

figure it out, and turned back to find the well-hidden arrow. There was a long 
straight slog on the path between 295 North and 295 south. But there was only 
one way off, as most knew. At the old dirt road that crosses under 295, about 
2/3 of a mile up. There was, of course a check under 295. Not a beer check. That 
would have been fine. But a lousy check that led them southwest on the dirt 
road, only to find the hare. <o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

Trail led south towards the quarry, and came out of the woods above the quarry 
to the beer check. Finding the beer was challenging, and the hare was not much 
help at first. Does he have something against beer? Note to hares: You’re only 
hurting yourselves if you don’t produce the beer. This is not a game, you know. 
This is serious business.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

all I have to say.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
