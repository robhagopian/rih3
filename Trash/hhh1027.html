<p><font color="#008000">Run #1027</font>, Dec 5, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Just Sandra, Dick Doc</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Elmhurst and Environs.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Mid 30’s, 1” of Snow, cloudy.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner, Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Amish It Head, Yank My Doodle, 
Bondo Jovi, Oozing SD, Dry Foot Fairy. Visitors: Amazon.cum, Boner in the Circle (BH3). Virgin: Just Bob. Management: 
Seamus, Ben.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The virgin hares have picked up on something in their brief time with the RIH3. Beer is Good! They have learned this. 
They have learned that the best way to mask a pathetic trail is to provide beer in large quantities. At the start. 
Fundamental principles that we would all do well to learn!</p>

<p>The hashers arrived in <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra’s</font> garage. Some fine beer selections were available, 
along with some chips and nuts. A virgin, <font color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font> walked in looking for a running club. Ha! 
He found <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> half-way through their second beer. Ha! 
He looked concerned. Visitors from Boston: <font color="#FF0000">Amazon.cum</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Boner-in-the-Circle</font> arrived. RI’s <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font> respectively were their escorts. Confusing and yet revolting. Romance was in the 
air. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> cast a sultry eye at Seamus. <font color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font> looked 
slightly nauseated.</p>

<p>The hares came out of the house. They explained that because of the snow, most of the marks were on poles, and some 
were flour lightly colored with Kool-Aid. This was a recipe for disaster. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> pointed out 
that this garage seemed to contain a good supply of beer and food. Thus, this run could be skipped. <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font> looked confused. Most were on the point of agreeing loudly. But somehow the hares managed 
to shoo everyone out into the cold. They were off at 6:30.</p>

<p>Trail started south on Jastram and came to a check at the Pleasant Valley Parkway. This road has a nice drainage canal 
in the center. It builds in volume and odor until it goes underground and ends up in the Woonasquatucket. Some potential 
shiggy was there. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> turned east. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turned west. There 
was much confusion as they tried to fit the canal into the plan of the trail. But the novice hares hadn’t been in the 
zone. What a waste! Sadly, the pack turned away as <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> found marks and called “On On”. He 
and then <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> led north on Academy.</p>

<p>The pack was strung out along Academy, and unexpectedly came upon the Academy! Lasalle, that is. Track oval. Swimmin’ 
pools! Playin’ Fields. Seeing the fields, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> guessed correctly. He turned left across a 
parking lot, and followed the perimeter of the fields. Some shiggy! Fences, poor marks and general incompetence led to 
confusion as they came out onto Smith St. But finally a few marks were found crossing Smith and continuing north on 
Nelson. With childlike confidence, <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> continued steadily north. With remarkable (and 
misplaced) trust, <font color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font> followed <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font>. Perhaps something 
else motivated him. One never knows. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> turned east and again found true trail.</p>

<p>The hares were in mid-pack, marking the checks. This was little help, because in the snow, no one could see the checks 
in the first place. The pack was now led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> as they came to the square at Eaton and 
River. It seemed obvious that the hares would turn onto the campus of PC. But that was <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s
</font> choice. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> warned <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> off, and the two tried south 
briefly. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> caught on though and followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> across 
campus. The students ignored the hashers, assuming it was either: a) a fraternity prank, b) a complex psychological test, 
or c) the sinister workings of Opus Dei or the Knights Templar or the Da Vinci Code, or d)WHATeverr!</p>

<p>Exiting the campus, they again lost trail briefly due to the excellent camouflage provided by the snow. But <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> saw <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font>, and with <font color="#FF0000">Boner in the 
Circle</font>, turned south on Huxley. Back to Smith Street they came. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> ran into the 
assisted living grounds, looking for colonoscopy candidates. The rest turned southeast onto Convent. Trail led back to 
Pleasant Valley Parkway, and then south on Oakland crossing into Davis Park. A “BN” was sighted.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to the beer, located at the back of the 
baseball diamond, at the base of the hill. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, certain that the BC would be more scenic, 
floundered about atop the hill, looking for marks and coming up empty. He saw the gathering at the base, and came down to 
join them. They decided to move the festivities back up hill mainly to try and lose <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Boner
</font> arrived. They quickly moved up hill. Unfortunately, there was insufficient time to finish off the beer. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> arrived. Even worse, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> arrived. In civilian clothes. Now 
only <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Virgin Bob</font> were missing. With two beers left, 
their lights were sighted. <font color="#FF0000">Bob</font> looked quite worn out, and it seemed that it wasn’t from the 
run.</p>

<p>Beer finally finished, they were on out, without benefit of marks. <font color="#FF0000">Boner</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Yank my Doodle</font> showed the way, both falling dramatically on the snow covered slopes. Show offs! The 
pack split in two. The local experts, led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
headed straight. They promptly got lost. The visitors, <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Boner
</font>, led <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
on a wild race straight to 81 Jastram. They even beat <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, who was driving. So much for 
local knowledge! The Garage was closed, but the house was not. But all they could scrounge in the refrigerator was a 
half-empty bottle of Riesling. Disgusting. They finished it off anyways. <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> showed up. 
She opened the garage door and the beer was freed.</p>
 
<p>The circle took place as the stragglers stumbled in. The ratings were good, in spite of the pavement, lack of losses, 
lack of shiggy and clear weather. But it was a farewell hash for <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font>, the hares were 
female AND virgin, and there had been plenty of good beer. Total: <b>6.9</b>! Hashit was improvised: a bicycle helmet 
duct-taped to the head of first <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and then <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. 
Protecting those two from brain damage? A bit late, really! Finally, the circle degenerating almost beyond hope, a naming: 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font> was named <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under Pubic Saw-her-squat</font>. Your scribe 
won’t even attempt to explain this one. For cryin’ out loud! Pathetic!</p>

<p>Anxious to get the perpetrators of this pathetic name away from her neighborhood as soon as possible, <font 
color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> packed them off to the On On On. This was at the <font color="#FF0000">Club 412</font>. 
Pizza was ordered, along with four or five giant salads. The pizza was fine, but the salads provoked quite a bit of 
confusion. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> wasn’t there. There were no sheep nearby to bribe. Most of the salad ended 
up in the beer. Then desserts, and song, as the evening ended, and the hash sadly bid a fond farewell to <font 
color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> (who doubtless was by this time secretly sighing in relief.)</p>
