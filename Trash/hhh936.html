<p>A fine spring evening with temperatures below freezing assured another fantastic turnout for the RIH3. They especially 
looked forward to the thought of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> as hare. And he didn’t disappoint. After unsuccessfully 
waiting a few extra minutes for some police to arrive and break up the group, or even for anyone to talk them out of it, 
they set off. The hare set an arrow pointing southwest, across the street into virgin territory on the Alton Jones Campus 
of URI. But there were no marks. Ha Ha! The hare sure got them, that time!</p>

<p>They reversed northeast, across the road back to their cars. They continued up a dirt pathway into Wickaboxet. A quick 
check sent <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to the left, off for parts unknown. What does he do with himself, alone in 
the woods with Seamus for such long periods each week? The others took the left fork, and milled about the next check for 
a while until the hare indicated that they were to go east on a long bushwhack downhill. This little jaunt was remarkable 
for the lack of flour, the lack of coordinated search efforts on the part of the hashers, and the confusion and 
disorientation of the hare himself, who lost his own trail. The two-timer <font color="#FF0000">Mr Whipple</font> was 
without flashlight. The trail was so bad, this made no difference whatsoever.</p>

<p>A secondary access road was reached. The hare turned south. The rest turned north. There were no marks, but after a 
short distance, a check was discovered. True trail seemed to go east, but this in fact led only to a prolonged and painful 
circle jerk on far side of Acid Factory Brook. The group stayed together, trying to decipher another <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font> masterpiece of hashing. They eventually realized that they’d better turn back or all the beer might be gone 
by the time they found the BC. The hare and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>were nowhere to be seen. (Of course it 
turned out that the cache of beer was as safe from this pair as if it had been hidden in Ft Knox.)</p>

<p>Trail was resumed west from the check on the dirt road. After a short distance, flour curved slightly south of west and 
bushwhacking resumed. Going generally uphill, a path was found that led to the top of Rattlesnake Ledge, where there was 
a clearly marked “B”. Still there was no hare and there was no <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font> Unfortunately there 
was also no beer. While searching the underbrush in widening circles, they finally heard <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>blundering through the brush from the east, while the hare showed up from the south down at the foot of the 
cliff.</p>

<p>The hare indicated that he had hidden the beer at the base of the ledge in a “cave”, and he went to get it. It was soon 
apparent that he had lost the beer! For a few moments, panic reigned. Finally, the blind (<font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>) and the unilluminated (<font color="#FF0000">Mr Whipple</font>) had to come down to find it for him. 
Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
stayed atop the cliff, looking at the stars and assuming (wrongly) that the lazy trio below would bring the beer up to the 
BC where it was supposed to be. A prolonged yet tiresome verbal jousting of the half-wits took place from the top to the 
bottom. (No hasher can fully resist the call of a brew however, so it was a foregone conclusion that the BC was held in 
a muddy and urine-stained pile of rocks at the base rather than on the pristine and beautiful peak.)</p>

<p>On in trail was found leading south, and was uneventful. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and the hare managed not 
to get lost. They circled up and rated the run. Good weather, little shiggy and failure to lose <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>initially sent the marks well into the negative. But the lack of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and 
his dogs, the long circle-jerk and the almost incredible incompetence of the hare were enough to raise the total to 0.69. 
Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> because she liked the big red plastic baseball bat that now accompanied 
the toilet seat. “Hmmn!” she said. “I bet <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> is gonna love this!”</p>

<p>On On On was of course at Marks, where our songs are always welcome, and our visitors and virgins can be sure to sample 
the pleasures of malt vinegar in their Guinness. Another fine evening was had and all looked forward to next weeks 
adventure, especially when they heard that <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was hare.</p>
