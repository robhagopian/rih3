<p>In another adventure for those native Rhode Islanders, the H3 once again
trekked over the Braga Bridge for a run. Several members resisted the urge to
pull off to Battleship Cove, and made it to the edge of the State to gather
together behind some farm that had lots of pumpkins and sea shells laying about.
This was reached by traveling through the metropolis of Tiverton Four Corners.
(Check your excitement at the door)</p>
<p>The hare, <font color="#CC0000">Eveready</font>, in her virgin lay, was
organizing her own field trip to the onion fields with <font color="#CC0000">Oozing,</font>
for the benefit of all who attended. <font color="#CC0000">Dr WHO Slasher</font>,
<font color="#CC0000">Bondo, Shine On, WIPOS, PW, Async, Short Peck, Sex
something, Just Peter</font>, and <font color="#CC0000">Just Jack</font> struck
the jackpot when 6:30 rolled around and <font color="#CC0000">Enema Bill</font>
(LAM) had not arrived! Could the rookie score a perfect 10 in the first try? On
out was called down a lonely dirt road towards a pumpkin pile when, to everyone’s
dismay, <font color="#CC0000">Enema Bill LAM </font>came careening down the
seashell lane to catch up with the H3. <font color="#CC0000">Eveready’</font>s
debut would not be perfect.</p>
<p>Caressing a small horn like he was in the shower, <font color="#CC0000">Enema
Bill LAM </font>raced to catch the pack, completely ignoring the gift of a new
bugle, donated by <font color="#CC0000">PW</font>, that had been left atop the
seashells.</p>
<p>The trail came to a first check , easily dispatched, then through a fetid
pool, and into the woods. Night came in quickly, forcing all to whip out
flashlights, or whatever cylindrical device they might have in hand. So, with
various degrees of light, the beer check was found a short time later.</p>
<p>It was at the beer check that the hare really earned the admiration of the
RIH3. There beneath a bench built into a tree, stood hundreds of blue insulated
coolers, each with a different type of fine beer inside. Beer! Free gifts! A
tree! What other favors would the hare provide?</p>
<p>The circle then degenerated into a spirited discussion between <font color="#CC0000">Enema
Bill LAM</font> and <font color="#CC0000">PW</font>. <font color="#CC0000">Enema
Bill</font> was outraged that <font color="#CC0000">PW </font>did not have the
new bugle which <font color="#CC0000">PW</font> was donating to him. How
ungrateful! <font color="#CC0000">Enema</font> even threatened to file criminal
charges against <font color="#CC0000">PW </font>for his generosity! (
Disregarding the fact that <font color="#CC0000">PW</font> is one of the few
members of his family <i>not</i> in law enforcement . Besides where in Rhode
Island is a Dutch man going to win out over an Italian in a court?) . <font color="#CC0000">Enema</font>
was then distracted by a song about genitalia and left the topic. (Distraction
works well when dealing with toddlers) . Genitalia also seemed to be on the mind
of <font color="#CC0000">Shine On</font>, but then again, when is it not?</p>
<p>After an extra long beer check, on out was called and the H3 made it’s way
out of the woods, the constant calling of &quot;<font color="#CC0000">WIPOS</font>&quot;
echoing among the trees. In a rare change, <font color="#CC0000">WIPOS</font>
decided to run/walk back to the start with the pack, ignoring the siren call of
the Tiverton Taxi Co.</p>
<p>On to the Circle under a beautiful co under a beautiful cool clear night.
Then, tragedy struck, the hare was out of beer! She had generously put out so
much at the beer check, that none was left for the circle! <font color="#CC0000">Oozing</font>,
as the experienced co-hare was immediately blamed, but immediately redeemed
himself by driving out to secure a fresh supply of Sam Cream Stout, and
airfields outside Karachi. No irony was lost as he was driven off by <font color="#CC0000">Dr
WHO</font>, whose Naval officer whites still hang in the closet.</p>
<p>The thirsty hashers occupied themselves with the presentation of a bugle by
the generous <font color="#CC0000">PW</font> to <font color="#CC0000">Enema Bill
LAM</font>. This was horn from <font color="#CC0000">PW</font>‘s private
collection, engraved with a large &quot;PW&quot; on it’s side. The gift was
given because we all know that when <font color="#CC0000">Enema Bill LAM</font>
blows, he is thinking of <font color="#CC0000">PW</font>. Talk of bugles led the
hare to reveal her recent losses in the game of love. After a Vince Lombardi pep
talk, she was prepared to head back into the ring.(Head? Who said head?) No
Hashers need apply.</p>
<p>Down Downs appropriately given to the hares, and the <font color="#CC0000">WIPOS</font>.
The Hare was called back into the circle for a proper naming ceremony. Playing
to her known predilections, Strap On, Eager Beaver, and Blows Oozing were all
suggested, although none gathered enough votes. Finally, after Dr WHO changed
his vote, the name of <font color="#CC0000">Everready</font> was bestowed on our
new member. And the hare.</p>
<p>The Hashit was transferred to <font color="#CC0000">Enema Bill LAM</font>,
who in his quest to assign a down down to <font color="#CC0000">PW</font> for
the generous donation of a bugle, was reminded that it was <b><i>he</i></b> who
started the search for <font color="#CC0000">WIPOS</font> last week. If it’s
in print, it must be true.</p>
<p>The On ON was held at Big Pinks, or Minks or something like that. The crew
without real jobs all continued the time honored H3 tradition of watching <font color="#CC0000">Enema
Bill LAM</font> sing &quot;Alouette&quot; to the waitress, get a warning from
the barman, and then an evaluation from Oozing. On this date, <font color="#CC0000">Everready</font>
didn't just smile and chaperone the students. She danced on a table and was
ejected from the bar. Now that’s a true Hasher!</p>
<p>ON ON</p>
