<p><font color="#0000ff">Run: </font>#844 July 1, 2002<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Hare: </font><font color="#FF0000">Raging QOB</font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Where:</font> parking lot, Biscuit City launch area, Charlestown.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Theme</font>: Great Swamp part deux, or Can-We-get-Lost-Again-Hash, or 
Will-Async-Abandon-Us-Yet-Again-Hash?<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Scribe:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Temp:</font> balmy lower 90s, humidity around 65%.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> basket BB, Async, DrWHO Slasher, WIPOS, Oozing SD, BondoJovi, PW and the hare 
Raging QOB.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Mgt: </font>Jake, Baxter, Ben and Zoe.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Absent: </font>anyone who has brains. Rumour has it tho' that Tinker is TOO HIP for the Rhody hash. 
Rumour also has it that the hash denentress Eazy EverReady Beaver and KNO were once again present at the start, attempted 
to make out in the lovely idyllic surroundings until the deer flies attacked them. Which brings me back to the most 
conspicous virgins present at this weeks hash: a gazillion deer flies!</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff"><br>The Run</font></p>
<p>The hare tried his best to thwart the die-hard rhody hash from making it to this weeks hash by giving them nonsensical 
d'erections taken straight out of Lewis Carrol's Phantasmagoria, but webmaster <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> caught 
on and gave correct d'erctions. Despite this, the hash was late to start as it was a good hour away from Providence!</p>

<p>The run commemorated Canada Day-was this why marks where either backwards or indecipherable? Hash marks were explained 
clearly in French.</p>

<p>The run also commemorated the day of the building of the first air raid shelter this day in 1937 in Idaho (see <font 
color="#FF0000">DrWHO</font>, I too can cum up with meaningless but true trivia), however no frickin' shelter could have 
protected us from the flies on this run! Did I already mention the flies? Did y'all know this was the week killer African 
bees were first seen in Virginia in 2000? Maybe those were'nt really deer flies...</p>

<p>The run took the pack about 1/2 a mile down route 2 then back right into the woods to the first check and true trail 
parallel to the road. The trail was well marked both with flour and toilet paper. Soon tho' there was little trail and 
much more bush-whacking. The trail appeared to go southwards and then eastwards but who knows? Lots more checks and trail 
went thru swamp, fields, turf farms and woods and finally out into the opening. The flies stayed with the pack with <font 
color="#FF0000">PW </font>vowing never to hash again (yippee!). Tired, wet, dirty and bug-bitten i.e.. pretty much the 
same as they were the pack finally broke into the open with no sight of the hare, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> or 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.&nbsp; Running thru the full length of a turf farm and back into the woods and the BC 
where the hare and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were waiting.&nbsp; Luckily no Bud. Is the <font 
color="#FF0000">Raging</font> one trying to get into the rhody good books again? Beer was heartily consumed as the flies 
finally took off on us. Soon <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> also joined the pack.&nbsp <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had attempted to venture on bike but after both tires punctured early he was saved by the 
hare.</p>

<p>On from the BC the trail went across a couple of more farms then back into the woods/shiggy and eventually out onto the 
monument that commemorates the massacre of countless Indians by the pale faced settlers. The rhody hash continues to replay 
this aspect of history by throwing weekly abuse (and thehashit) on its non-palefaced hashing brethren.</p>

<p>The circle was commenced and the hare got his due abuse (as if having to rescue a smelly <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>was not enough). Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for wheel (first 2 then 4) 
hashing. Down downs consumed then the hash retired to Mike's where lovely waitresses served pitchers of cold beer, rubbed 
balm into our sores and bites and fed us food. And all for free! Too bad <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">PW</font> had to go to their respective homes early (or so they tell us!). A good time had by all...</p>

<p>ONON.</p>
