<p><font color="#008000">Run #1033</font>, January 16, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Chepachet, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 30's</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish It Head, Bondo, Cum Under PSHS, Dr. WHO, Oozing, Snotty (Heinfeld 
H3), Trail Hoover, WIPOS, Seamus, and Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Prelube:</font></p>

<p>For reasons unexplained, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, the assigned hare for the week, could not perform 
his measly duties.  So who did he go to for help?  No, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> did he not go to for help.  
Rather, the assigned hare went to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for assistance.  And <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> agreed, the lush that he is.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this would have been an uneventful, uninteresting, and unfulfilling hash, except for the fact that it 
wasn’t.  Allow me to explain…</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> hurried out of work promptly at 4:27 p.m. knowing that he had to cut diagonally 
across the vast state of Rhode Island, through rush hour traffic, in order to make it by 6:30.  No worries, as he was 
driving his turbo-charged, custom-tuned 292 hp all-wheel-drive Subaru.  Yet his mind was somewhere else, as this was the 
night of his anniversary with his girlfriend –they’d been together for two years now, and he told her, “sorry sweetie, but 
I’ve got to hash tonight.”  So what was on his mind?  He was thinking, “the make-up sex is gonna be awesome!”  His 
thoughts could not be more wrong (but now we know why he's always smiling).</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> hurried out of work promptly at 4:29 p.m., just like any other day.  Not in a rush 
at all, he went home to have a few <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brews to off-set <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s
</font> hoppy IPA’s (not to be confused with I pee, eh?).  And then it happened – nature’s call.  At 4:45 p.m. URI 
researchers in Kingstown noticed seismic activity in the realm of Woonsocket, which measured 5.1 on the Richter scale.  
They were perplexed:  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was relieved.  He arrived at Cady’s with plenty of time to spare 
and glowing with satisfaction.</p>

<p>At 4:28 p.m. <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> didn’t know what to do.  “Oh, it’s too far away, I’ll never make 
it”.. “Oh, I should just go”.. “Oh, I don’t know what to do.”  After 15 minutes of internal conversation, she decided to 
go.  And then she spent 25 minutes trying to find her hash clothes and cell phone.  And then her cell phone rang, and she 
spent another 20 minutes talking while looking for her wallet.  At 5:45 p.m. she finally pulled out of her driveway, just 
in time to hit the bulk of stop-and-go traffic along Rt. 44.</p>

<p>At 4:26 p.m., <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was retracting the flexible video endoscope out of his last patient 
for the day.  As he did so, he noticed a strange object hidden inside the patient’s rectum.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO
</font> really, really had to go pee.  But being the professional that he is, he asked for the nurse for an empty bottle.  
She assisted him dutifully.  He didn’t even have to unzip his pants, as he simultaneously relieved himself while examining 
this strange anomaly on the patient’s inner rectal cavity  She even tapped the last drops from him.  He didn’t want to be 
late for the hash, so he told the nurse to have the patient schedule a follow-up exam.  At 5:10 p.m. he was off to the 
hash.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> last appointment was scheduled for 4:45 p.m.  Like most shrinks, these 
appointments never last more than 10 minutes; however, today his patient was new.  She strolled in like a movie star, and 
she looked like one too.  Not the modern-day Hollywood types, but old school – Rita Hayworth-like.  <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> was captivated by her hips, as they swaggered over to his leather seat, in her short, tight, thin, 
single-piece dress.  She sat down, clearly wanting a cigarette.  Smoking was not allowed.  She ignored it and lit up 
anyway.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> couldn’t object, so he began his routine of questioning with beads of nervous 
sweat on his forehead.  He got to the most important and difficult question of his routine, and asked, “so, tell me how 
you are feeling today?”  In her Sharon Stone-famous-single-motion-picture-moment, she uncrossed her legs and re-crossed 
them clearly displaying her…. one black one, one white one, and one with a bit of…  [I digress].  <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> was late to the hash, as he spent 30 minutes hyperventilating in the parking lot.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> was supposed to help the hare set trail.  At 4:30 p.m, he was nowhere to be seen, 
so <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> took off without him.  Snotty was stuck in Providence, saying to himself, “where 
can anyone get a bloody decent pint around here!  Those bloody Yanks don’t know a good pub if one hit him in his bloody 
ass.”  (or something to that effect)  And then it dawned on him that there was a hash tonight, and then it dawned on him 
that he was driving on the wrong side of the road.  One thing led to another… yadda, yadda, yadda… and the police finally 
let him go after completing the accident report.  Like <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Snotty
</font> was late to the hash.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> arrived at the South Attleboro train station at 4:32 p.m.  She would only 
have had to wait 15 minutes for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to arrive to pick her up – or so she thought, sitting 
on the bench with the cool brisk breezy winter air touching her deepest nerves.  Fifteen minutes passed.  Thirty minutes 
passed.  She was reaching the end of her song selection on her I-Pod.  She was getting pissed.  She called his cell 
phone.  No answer.  She was freezing, nearing state of hypothermia.  Angrily, she stomped her feet against the frozen 
concrete to bang some feeling back into her toes.  47 minutes later, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> finally arrived, 
with his windows open to chill his sweat.  He was still sweating and shaking profusely:  she was frozen to the core.  
(you do the math)</p>

<p>At 4:27 p.m. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was desperately looking for a missing layer of Kevlar ® (a registered 
trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company).  It was cold outside.  They were to run in the woods.  It was dark.  It 
was a <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> hash.  Without his precious Kevlar ® (a registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de 
Nemours and Company), <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> would have been doomed.  69 minutes later he found it on the top 
of his roof.  Apparently, there was a small leak in the roof, and the only way to keep the water out was to use something 
durable enough to handle the wintry weather.  Only Kevlar ® (a registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and 
Company) would have sufficed.  With his trusty Kevlar ® (a registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company) in 
tact <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was well protected this chilly evening.  His home was not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Each of the hashers arrived at Cady’s with their own little adventure and story to tell from the previous two hours of 
their lives.  What they should have done was go into Cady’s, order beer, and share their stories.  That certainly would 
have been more entertaining and enjoyable than the actual hash itself.  Be that as it may, the hare instructed the wankers 
to head across the street and into the all-to-familiar George Washington Management Area.  Even Seamus and Ben were 
unimpressed with the lack of originality.</p>

<p>They quickly reached the Blue Dot trail and continued north.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> blazed the way as 
every check was straight and north until they reached the Orange Dot trail.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was not 
fooled and correctly guessed westward along the Orange Dot trail.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> the FRB was quickly 
DFL, except that <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was telling <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> about his Kevlar ® (a registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company) 
misadventures.  Of course, with such intense and passionate conversations, they could only walk, not run the trail.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the Red Dot trail, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> all headed southward toward Wilbur Pond.  They guessed correctly – go figure.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> started to lag behind as she never fully recovered from her hypothermic state.  
Reaching Wilbur Pond along the Orange Dot trail, they all were desperately seeking beer.  This was perhaps the most 
eventful part of the hash, as the hare could not remember where he stashed the beer.  Brilliant!  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> looked right.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> searched left.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS
</font> looked nowhere.  <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> was confused.  Finally, the Brit felt pity for the 
pathetic Yanks so <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> quickly found the beer stash.  All were content.</p>

<p>After some singing and quenched with beer, they departed heading south back to their cars and Circle was held.  
Positive comments included:  No <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>!  No <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>!  Quality 
Beer!  <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font>!  Not one, but two quality bimbos!  The negatives were too many to count, but 
all in all, the overall rating was <b>+0.6.9</b>!  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for reasons nobody 
understood or cared about.  Despite that they were at Cady’s, the hare refused to order pizza.  So they were stuck with 
eating Cady’s finest gourmet cheeseburgers (if one could call it that!).  Nevertheless, that pretty much concluded this 
eventful, yet uneventful evening.</p>
