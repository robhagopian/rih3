<P>&nbsp;<br><font color="#0000ff">The 
Run:<BR> </font><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The co-hare was 
waiting in the parking lot of the North Cumberland Middle School claiming that 
the hare was out re-marking trail because of the rains earlier in the day. A 
likely story! The hash believed that the hare had been caught earlier by a 
former school teacher who made him sit in the corner for a while, and then clap 
the chalkboard erasers, in retribution for sins long ago, but never 
forgotten.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Most were content to 
wait as six thirty came and went. But <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, men on a mission, took off right on time, and found 
trail behind the school, heading northwest. The hare was forced to hide several 
times.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The rest of the 
pack finally gave up on the hare. They should have given up on the run 
altogether. But with three bimbos and two virgins a showing had to be made. The 
leaders were quickly off trail, and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, having set 
here several times before, led as they ran west and uphill. The virgins were 
presented with the choice of following <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> or <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. They chose wisely and stuck with <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> and the co-hare. A false trail was ignored by <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, who continued uphill to where he thought the beer 
should be. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> blazed his own trail towards 
Staples Road, and as usual, became lost.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The true trail 
was stumbled upon by <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, turning northeast. He 
managed to find the Beer Check and the hare near a small and non-descript rock 
on the ridge just above the river. The rest of the pack soon caught up, even 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. But <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was only 
halfway through the loop, and had two more river crossings before he turned back 
and found the group. He was just in time to nab the last IPA. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>was caught considerably longer in some briars, but 
alas, even he was able to find the group eventually. Note to hash: don’t start 
singing if <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> is still lost. He may be blind, but 
he still has his hearing. It will attract him.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">After a 
prolonged rhubarb session, the beer was gone. And so they were on out. Trail may 
have meandered to the east side of the river. It may have crossed the swamp just 
behind the school. It may have climbed the steep hill and crossed the boulders 
just north. But no one will ever know as the hash simply followed the main path 
southeast back to the school. They stopped just out of sight of the parking lot 
to circle up.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Ratings for the 
run: limited shiggy, recycled trail and no one lost taken against quality 
bimbos, no pavement whatsoever, and short trail. Total: +0.069! The virgins were 
questioned and the hashit was given to <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> knows why! They finished up and headed for Pitchers Pub 
where the level of behavior sharply deteriorated. But not being thrown out must 
mean something.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
