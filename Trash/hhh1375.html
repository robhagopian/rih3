Hashshit- Rusty<br><br>

Numerical rating for the trail was a positive Zero<br><br>

Confusion rained upon the attendees as they spread out over tree different parking areas assuming each was the correct start point, the Retards went to Asylum Rd, WeeBalls and his dog went to the Dog Park, and the rest of the pack found a lot just inside The Park which was the spot to be.<br><br>

Our start was a highly trafficked area, with people out exercising, driving, walking dogs etc so there was little opportunity for a quick scoop before one hit trail. Before we set off the hares, PG and CT gave instruction on what to follow (flour) and what not to follow (painted arrows), alas the late cummers were not privy to such info but it actually worked in their favor. Our visitors, Testy, Bladder Splatter and Mexican Gum Job accompanied by that infamous shortcutter, Dr. WHO, managed to find the beer stop within 10 minutes The rest of the pack aimlessly followed Assquack, SheMail and Hairy into the abyss of twisted bike paths and forest trail.<br><br>

Unknownst to the pack there was bike path etiquette to be followed as one cyclist reminded us “bikes on the right, walkers on the left”, we soon figured it out. Assquack proceeded to find a CB8, he was confused as to the purpose of said marking despite reassurances from Hairy that it was simply to delay the front runners from getting to the BN mark. Trail became a bit sketchy from this point as there were no additional marks when we checked back 8, suddenly Pussy Galore was on hand and marking trail that led to beachfront and a gallon jug of Sangria. WeeBalls was perturbed by the lack of cups and simply put his face under the spigot and began to consume the sweet nectar, this was followed by an interesting take on two dogs making out where one of them was about 3’ tall and the other a mere 9 inches – poor Lola.<br><br>

In the way off distance we heard Tinkers VuVuZela, but closer was the sound of “are you”, we waited for Oozie and Retard to show their faces and then we all continued in search of the beer. Mr Rogers and Rusty took the trail through the woods whereupon Rusty found a dark green Blackberry amongst the scrub, a quick search of the photos and contact list revealed a phone contact by the name of Basket with further snooping revealing the contact Realtor Lady. This led us to believe that the phone was potentially SheMailMan’s and so it would be kept until the awarding of the hashshit in the circle.<br><br>

The pack was suddenly starting to come together and found the previously attended Beer Stop a short trek off the baseball field, the excitement was short lived as the thirsty bastards that had gotten there early had gorged themselves on the beer until they couldn’t drink anymore. WHO said that’ll teach them, maybe they won’t show up next week Arrrrrrr.<br><br>

From here it became a bit of a Butt Plug trail, we just followed some route back to the cars. Circle up was held a short distance off the parking lot. The usual traditions were followed and once again Rusty ended up with the HashShit because the phone actually belonged to one of the hares, and, as we all know, the Hare cannot get the HashShit.<br><br>

Track 84 was the venue for the on-after, pizza was ordered, good beer was on tap, darts were played (badly) and the cash only venue is going up market with the introduction of their very own second set of accounting books ie the ATM machine in the corner. Could be interesting to see how much is withdrawn from the machine each year relative to reported bar sales…..<br><br>
