Retar'D just got back from sunny, warm and friendly Thailand, only to find he'd been put on the Hareline for A Cold, Winters Evening (there's a song there) Hash. <br/><br/>

It was the Hash before Christmas<br/>
And all 'round Rhode Island<br/>
Trees were all trimmed <br/>
With balls and bright garland<br/><br/>

Retar'd was back from holiday<br/>
Far away in Bangkok<br/>
Just to lay some flour<br/>
For the Hash of the Red Cock<br/><br/>

The moon was shining<br/>
On the hard pack dry ground<br/>
As one by one Hashers arrived<br/>
Without much of a sound<br/><br/>

They quickly found in his car<br/>
A box with cold beer<br/>
Then Hash voices singing<br/>
Of good Hashmas Cheer<br/><br/>

Soft in the beginning<br/>
Then rising so high<br/>
Like a Welsh male voiced choir<br/>
Brought a tear to my eye<br/><br/>

Beers were finished<br/>
As 6:30 soon came<br/>
And the pack darted out<br/>
On On they proclaimed<br/><br/>

The trail started west<br/>
On the Beauregard Loop<br/>
Some falling behind<br/>
The quick running group<br/><br/>

A check was discovered<br/>
Leading out to the old road<br/>
With the pack quite seperated <br/>
The pace was now slowed<br/><br/>

Butt Plug found flour that led<br/>
To a field and a check<br/>
That fooled all the Hashers<br/>
Then exclaimed, "What the F' heck"<br/><br/>

Finally Donkey saw flour<br/>
Leading back to the cars<br/>
Soon all were together<br/>
To find beer that was ours <br/><br/>

Behind the fence<br/>
Among trees standing tall<br/>
Songs were sung<br/>
And orange food for all<br/><br/>

The Hare stood in the middle<br/>
A circle was formed<br/>
Complaints of no flour or shiggy<br/>
With antics performed<br/><br/>

Then out from the trees <br/>
All covered with glitter<br/>
And balls and lights<br/>
There came but a tither<br/>

Santa did arrive<br/>
So fancy and quick<br/>
With a bag of some goodies<br/>
For all a good sip<br/><br/>

It was a bottle of Baileys Creme<br/>
And all got a taste<br/>
In a small plastic cup<br/>
It went down in great haste<br/><br/>

So the run was rated <br/>
A poor negative 6.9<br/>
But we all did agree<br/>
It was a pretty good time.<br/><br/>

Merry Christmas
