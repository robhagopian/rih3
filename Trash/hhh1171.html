<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hash started at the Midway parking area in Arcadia. Not 
exactly virgin territory, but at least a virgin co-hare. We must count our 
blessings where we find them. The hare marked an arrow that led the pack across 
165 to the south.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail entered 
the woods. The pack was together as they looped east and up a large hill. South 
again, and then turning back west down the hill to the first crossing of the 
Wood River. <FONT color=#ff0000>Baaa</FONT> was impressed. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> led early; some 
poor choices put <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> in the lead. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> was just arriving. He never crossed the road and 
blundered about the slopes of Mt Tom for a while.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">A second river 
crossing was found. <FONT color=#ff0000>Baaa</FONT> became upset. There are no 
rivers in Korea, apparently. The pack came to the fields and pine grove just 
south of the Mt Tom parking area. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> decided to 
try north. <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> took a hint from the hares and continued to Mt Tom 
Rd, turning south. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> ran back and forth for a 
while. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> needs his exercise. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> had given up by this point and headed back to his 
truck for a beer. <FONT color=#ff0000>Baaa</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS 
</FONT>followed the hares.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Eventually, 
trail was found on the north side of Parris Brook, continuing west. It was 
obvious at this point that the BC would be on the cliffs that make up the 
southern end of Mt Tom. And in fact, the beer was found and opened. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS </FONT>straggled in to 
find beer, a lovely view, and NO <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, NO <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and NO <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>! Doesn’t get 
much better that that! Songs were sung, and even <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> was on key for once. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Beer finished, 
they continued on the trail, northwest along the ridge and back to Rt. 165. 
Flashlights were needed by this point, and when the hares tried to direct them 
to true trail in the woods to the north, <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> decided against it, and ran east on the road, 
leading the rest of the pack. They arrived in the lot to find <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> being forced to 
listen to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT> usual tale of bushwhacking, briars 
and bullshite.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Circling up, the 
run was rated. Good river shiggy, scenic beer stop with NO <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, NO <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and NO <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>. Total: 6.9! The visitor was interrogated and 
punished. The co-hare was named with assistance from the hare: <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Florence Wallbanger</FONT>. Hashit went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, for abandoning trail and not sharing his beer. And, 
really, for showing up at all. Finishing up, they went on to the Black River 
Inn.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
