<font face="Arial" size="2">The sun oozed over the horizon, shoved aside
darkness, crept along the greensward, and, with sickly fingers, pushed through
the castle window, revealing the pillaged princess, hand at throat, crown
asunder, gaping in frenzied horror at the sated, sodden amphibian lying beside
her, disbelieving the magnitude of the frog's deception, screaming madly,
&quot;YOU LIED!&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Uhhh, ummmm.. this started out as a state-of-the-art
write-up on Tuesday morning. It's now Saturday morning. The inspiration has
completely worn off. So here's the write-up, without hyperbole, exaggeration, or
frogs.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
CHECK BACK RUN NO 784 (?)<br>
Hare: <font color="#FF0000">Async</font><br>
Venue: Rhode Island's own Appalachia<br>
<br>
This well-used area south of the Route 44 is always a good one. No one who lives
there owns a telephone so no one calls the police. Some of them don't even have
houses. We once literally ran across a family living in a car. In fact, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
has used this area so often that people call out greetings as we run past, the
most common being &quot;Where's that bastard <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>?
He still owes me child support!&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">As the pack needed no introduction to the area, <font color="#FF0000">Async's</font>
instructions were simple: &quot;that way&quot;, &quot;two beer stops&quot;, and
&quot;<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, don't shit on the trail&quot;.
&quot;Pack&quot; by way of explanation, is a somewhat generous description. The
usual turnout is two physical cripples, two mental cripples, one emotional
cripple, two state-assigned medical minders, and the Grand Master who is a dog.
This does not include <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font>. He carefully
distances himself from the pack, appearing here and there on rocks in the middle
of the woods.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">This time one of our minders, <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
Oozing,</font> was missing. (The problem, which doesn't bother too many of us,
might have been gainful employment.) Furthermore, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. Who</font>
was totally distracted by the thought that he'd told last week's visitors to go
to a Big River site for this run. We may never see them or double figures
again.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;As a result, we were more or less left on our
own. Apparently we were so pathetic that the hare had to run back and forth, in
front of the pack, behind the pack, in and out of the woods, herding us kind of
like a large sheepdog. He was also constantly changing shirts, blowing whistles,
and shouting &quot;on-on&quot; in different voices, all in an attempt to create
the illusion that this is a big Hash. We accept all this as &quot;normal&quot;.
Gispert must be spinning like a top in his grave.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Five minutes into the run <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
deserts, thinking &quot;Two beer stops, what the fuck, that gives me a good
chance of finding one right now&quot;, and off he lurches toward water and
obvious shiggy. Later we find out that he circled the pond at least three times.
It took him fifteen minutes to do each circuit, but <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font>
attention span is only fourteen minutes.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">As promised, there were two beer stops, the first at
the top of this figure &quot;8&quot; run, and the second and the bottom of the
&quot;8&quot;, in our only shiggy. This was also two feet from the trail worn by<font color="#FF0000">
Bondo.</font> I really think he's losing it.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Then a pleasant stroll back to the cars from the
beer stop. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>: &quot;What would Gispert be
doing if he were alive today?&quot;<font color="#FF0000"> Tinker:</font> &quot;Dunno.&quot;
<font color="#FF0000">Basket:</font> &quot;Scratching on&nbsp; the lid.&quot; <font color="#FF0000">Tinker:</font>
&quot;Oh.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The circle was called, and the hare was invited
to step forward for some recognition. In keeping with the kinder, gentler RIH3
image projected last Monday for the sake of some non-male visitors, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
received nothing but praise. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>went straight to
a &quot;6.9&quot;, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to a &quot;no fuck&quot;
run, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> forgot what he was going to say.
Jake, HMWHMH, then honored returners and visitors. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>,
the returner, had to explain how&nbsp; he'd managed to rupture his spleen while
coaching little girls, and he took a suspiciously long time thinking about it.
Baxter had to explain for the hundredth time why he keeps bringing <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>,
and Ben refused explain <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. (If someone ever
does explain<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font>, there's a Nobel Prize waiting.)
Instead, Ben took out his frustration by beating <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font> around the legs with a long stick. Finally <font color="#FF0000">Async's</font>
supply of rancid ten-year old micro-brewery specials ran out (Thank God), and
Jake dismissed the circle. If that's what &quot;woof&quot; means. Maybe it means
he misses Sweet Molasses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The O-O-O had 100% attendance at Cady's, which
must be the most tolerant public bar in the world. They serve food (of a sort),
but <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> ordered pizza brought in from outside.
Three or four videos going, we're screaming (we think it's singing), and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>
leaves a trail of salt on the floor because he doesn't realize he's holding the
salt shaker upside down. Nobody at the bar seems to care, notice, or even move. <font color="#FF0000">PW's</font>
pepper spray would have zero effect here. The pizza, especially the <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
special, was good, the beer was OK, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
jokes were bad - those few he managed to remember through to the punch line. I
think he's losing it, too. Here's an easy one, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF">SHINE-ON LEARNS THE WORST</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Shine-on gives birth, and afterwards the doctor
comes in, and he says, &quot;I have to tell you something about your baby.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sits up in bed and says, &quot;What's wrong with my baby, Doctor? What's
wrong???&quot;<br>
<br>
The doctor says &quot;Well, now, nothing's wrong, exactly, but your baby is a
little bit different. Your baby is<br>
a hermaphrodite.&quot;<br>
<br>
She says, &quot;A hermaphrodite... what's that???&quot;<br>
<br>
The doctor says, &quot;Well, it means your baby has the...er... features... of
both a male and a female.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shine-on turns pale. She says, &quot;Oh my God! You mean it has a penis...<br>
AND a brain?&quot;<br>
<br>
On on<br>
<br>
