<p><font color="#008000">Run #1095</font>, March 26, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dr. WHO</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Virgin territory in Swampsea</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Rainy, cold, chance of Thunder Storms</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket, Oozing, Async, Shameless the GM.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>“Another contender for Hash of the Year” WHO said that.</p>

<p>He also said, “<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, your hare has yet again found new and exciting terrain for a hash…. 
come and enjoy fine weather, prolonged daylight, and revel in the finest virgin hash the RIH3 has enjoyed since <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> last fine virgin hash…..there will be well-marked trail…..there will be just the right 
amount of shiggy…..there will be scenic vistas…..there will be intellectually stimulating checks, back-checks, and loops…..
there will be visitors…..there will be virgins…..there will be fine beer in hermetically sealed juice jars…..and savory 
snacks….perpetuate the legend”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had to say that, because nobody else would have. It’s Newton’s Law of ‘Every action 
has an equal but opposite reaction.” That is, if the Hare boasts how great the run will be, the lower your expectations, 
or more simply stated, “The <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> Effect”.</p>

<p>Despite the best weather we’ve had for a Hash all spring, the pack was surprisingly small. Not one virgin or coworker 
showed. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was fortunate enough to be on the left coast visiting family, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Double Flush</font> said she had to work late but that she’d love to join us later (yea sure) ; at least 
she gave an excuse. But where were <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Justin Myass</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>? This was <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> territory, and he didn’t show, neither 
did <font color="#FF0000">Hoovah</font> after promising she would.</p>

<p>The Hare begged friends and coworkers alike but it seemed his unctuous groveling had fallen on deaf ears. Think they 
all know something we don’t? Actually he had previously promised friends and coworkers would join us before and none have 
yet. Are you thinking, as I am, that he doesn’t have any friends but us, and now we need to question that too.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, with expectations quickly giving way to 
reality, gave the late cumers an extra 5 minutes before taking off on trail. The Hare dressed in his finest <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> like raingear, seemed disappointed at first, but quickly pulled himself together and pointed 
out the first mark on a tree across a field behind the Brown Elementary School.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led out crossing the playground, then negotiated a small woodland and swampy stream 
to a second field, where <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> said additional marks may be found heading north then easterly 
through a grave yard, and then crossing Gardner’s Neck Road to a small pond.</p>

<p>The marks were few and far between, as the recent (still falling hard) rain had washed out most of the flour. The 
remaining marks were slowly heading downstream along with the prospects of “the finest virgin hash the RIH3 has enjoyed 
since <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> “…bullshit. To our good (?) fortune, our dedicated Hare kept pointing out the 
disappearing marks to us so we could continue on trail. As we continued, he topped off the marks with fresh Pillsbury’s 
best, still holding out hope for any late cumers.</p>

<p>Trail led over a small dam that had a significant amount of water flowing over it. The ice has long since gone, but 
slimy goo remained. It was this treacherous undertaking that the Hare thought it would be good fun to send the pack (both 
of us) across, despite warnings of flash floods in the area. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> stood at waters edge and 
placed an arrow pointing over the dam.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was leading, and was just about 20 feet into the flowing river, when, as luck would 
have it, his feet slipped out from under him. Falling, he caught himself from sliding headfirst down a 15 foot fall, in 
what would have been a drastic event with far-reaching consequences that surely would have made the 11 o’clock news. 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> right hand suffered a severe injury, however he persisted on trail, none-the-less. 
What a Trooper!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> laughed heinously?</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was lagging far behind, with complaints of a sore thumb, bad knee ligament and 
maybe a hemorrhoid issue or two. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, having more concern for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> then his own wellbeing, kept his pace slow enough so <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> could hear him calling, 
“On On” through the torrential rains.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> didn’t care.</p>

<p>The trail continued around the pond in a counter clockwise fashion until a trail head was found off to the right. This 
led to a meandering trail through thick forests, across raging streams, and around many boulders and rock outcroppings, 
and as there were few marks, only being near the Hare guaranteed knowing where you were. A recently placed true trail mark 
that led into a swamp almost caught <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> on a falsie, but <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> had already found the false trail mark on the other side, and despite <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
encouraging <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to continue on, he declined and continued on until he caught up with 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>.</p> 

<p>When help is given so easily, don’t trust a hasher.</p>

<p>The hare had said before the start that he may have to change the location of the Beer Stop if we encountered the 
forecasted thunderstorms, so at every height of land, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> climbed, along with his trusty 
Shameless friend, looking for the elusive “B”.</p>

<p>Eventually <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> caught up with the Hare, while <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was 
high above the pack on a precipitous perilous peak. Searching the indiscernible trail below, <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> eventually showed <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> a good direction to travel towards the actual Beer Stop. 
This left <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> alone to hobble down the slick rock face with his throbbing little digit.</p>

<p>The Beer Stop was found at the next high rock, just as the rain started to subside. Many new songs were sung, as we 
enjoyed IPA and Porter in those hermetically sealed juice jugs. Then the savory snack of sunflower seeds was wolfishly 
devoured along with copious amount of beer. We continued calling OnOn for the lost visitors and virgins; <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knew where they were?</p>

<p>Eventually we decided to catch them at the start, and made our way back to our cars. We again came to the pond, where 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> waited for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to start across the dam, possibly wanting 
to view another calamity in the making. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> then turned left, and joining <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, took the bridge. At the cars we found <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> waiting for our 
return. He had found <font color="#FF0000">WHO’S</font> freshly re-marked trail offering him a trail he could follow out 
to the swamp, however the intentional false ‘true trail’ mark laid by the <font color="#FF0000">Bad Doctor</font> cut 
short his progress.</p>

<p>At the circle, the Hare received his DD, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for Hashit and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> for Backslider. Discussions abound about the poor marks, unnecessary and inaccurate boasting and broken 
promises. <font color="#FF0000">Flushy</font> was called, but having already donned her jammies, she declined but promised 
to show us a new bar next time we’re near. Beer done, we made our way to a nearby motel for sandwiches and beer at a local 
lounge lizard habitat.</p>

<p>Moral of this story is remember the <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> Effect,’ If it sounds too good to be true, it 
probably is.” </p>
