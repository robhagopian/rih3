<font color="#0000FF">The Run: </font></font></p>

<p>The run began at an ice sculpture of a penis 40 inches high (69,000 times the hare's actual size), and following 
kool-aid-tinted flour turned west into the woods through drifts up to three feet in depth, over rickety bridges crossing 
branches of the West Sneech River, up and downhill, with a few checks and double-backs easily mastered because of the 
hare's footprints. A pipeline access was reached and followed (or wallowed, depending upon the depth) northwest, 
ultimately coming out onto Plantation Rd. then Farm Rd east to Cumberland HS. Trail was sparse, but was found easily by 
FRBs <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>who thoughtfully left footprints going 
every-which-way to confuse the pack. Over the overpass, to and through Tucker field to the powerlines, then south on the 
lines to a high point above a frozen swamp for the BC. <br><br>

Hare decided to live set on the way out and went west to another gasline then south. The followers ignored trail at this 
point and burst through someone's yard on High Ridge Rd and took Forestview Dr back to Tuck's.<br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">Ratings:</font> 0.69 for length and amount of pavement.<br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">Hashit:</font> <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> for wilful destruction of aforementioned ice 
penis. <br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">Special Mention:</font> the owner of Tuck's, who took orders for nine Guinness's in the middle of 
the circle from the loading bay at the back of Tuck's.</p>
