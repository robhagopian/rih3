<font color="#0000ff">Location: </font>Freetown State Forest<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Weather:</font> 35, Snowy<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Present: </font>W.I.P.O.S.(hare) EverReady, KNO,&nbsp;The Slasher Dr W.H.O., Oozing Syphilitic 
Dicktaphone,&nbsp;Mr. Peabody(me, the scribe) Basket Boom Boom, and <font color="#ff0000"><em>Shamus</em></font></p>

<p>Well another Monday evening and I was sitting on the couch sniffing my balls when I notice <font color="#FF0000">Ever 
Ready</font> adjusting her strap (head lamp that is).&nbsp; Does that mean we are running through the woods again this 
evening?&nbsp; OHHH I am excited, maybe I'll meet someone tonight, maybe someone else besides me will smell and scratch 
my balls ....</p>

<p>We wait and wait, and finally <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> arrives dressed for snow and hiking and off we go.&nbsp; 
I am in the backseat anxiously awaiting the trail, I hear them talking of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and the trails 
he has set.&nbsp; They are checking for extra shoes and mittens as they notice the snow falling.&nbsp; I am now heavy 
breathing in anticipation (or was that them?)</p>

<p>The d'erections were a bit unclear or poorly defined but I directed <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> where the state 
forest was and there were the hashers, drinking their beer and adjusting headlamps ... is that what they were adjusting??
&nbsp; I jump out of the car and wait ... no Ben, no Jake, looks like it may be a fine evening afterall.</p>

<p>As we listen to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> explaining the marks, we see lights down the long dirt road ... it's 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> and who is that beautiful creature ... they call him &quot;shamus&quot;.
&nbsp; I am in love.&nbsp; Off we go, I'm following that beautiful long tail sniffing as much as I can that fresh a*hole 
but I must turn back, <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> &amp; <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font> are way in the back of 
the pack.&nbsp; Why are they always getting lost?&nbsp; And why are they always adjusting themselves??&nbsp; ??&nbsp; But, 
I digress ... where is that shamus ..........</p>

<p>We hike through the forest, over the streams and marked paths.&nbsp; There is so much flour in this d*mn forest I cannot 
stop sneezing .. either too much or too little .. isn't that always the way.&nbsp; We catch up to <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>, then <font color="#FF0000">Dr. Who</font> (who is limping from some fall), then we hear someone from behind, 
oh, we are excited, never mind it is <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> following his little tiny stamps he has stapled to 
trees in this thick forest. We let everyone pass us again and after a while we find fire and there it is; Shamus.&nbsp; Off 
the leash and chasing after me.&nbsp; We are running thru the fresh snow smelling, sniffing, a lick here and there but that 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> snaps a leash back on Shamus .. what?, I'm not good enough, with my sleek 
body and bodacious package?&nbsp; I could make your dog happy.&nbsp; Shamus wants me, I know it, we are in love ...But once 
again, I'm off the subject, the hash.</p>

<p>Everyone was enjoying the weird ale, laughing at <font color="#FF0000">Dr. Who's</font> fall in the stream, commenting 
on the lack of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, the loss of <font color="#FF0000">Tree House</font> &amp; <font 
color="#FF0000">Fowangi Boner</font> and how <font color="#FF0000">Summer's Eve </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Swallows 
My Pride</font>&nbsp;were probably still trying to follow those d'erections from <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.</p>

<p>Then <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>left the circle just in time to put the fire out with bodily fluids and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>turned us in the direction of the road.&nbsp; A nice 2 mile jaunt back to the dirt road in 
the falling snow.&nbsp;Weren't we in a scenic forest, why are we running down the road?&nbsp;I did manage to scout out a 
few nice looking hounds in the neighborhoods we went thru and even took a nice dump in the roadway, it had to be me, Bondo 
wasn't around this night.</p>

<p>The circle happened back at the cars.&nbsp; I got to &quot;play&quot; a bit more with Shamus until that mean Basket 
locked Shamus up in his cold car, so I went off to the woods to sulk.&nbsp; Meanwhile, they sang there crappy songs, drank 
their crappy beer and gave the run a -.69 because of the great weather and the hashit (which was missing) went to<font 
color="#FF0000"> KNO</font> &amp; <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font> for some stupid reason I didn't listen to.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> were whining about the cold, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. Who </font>was whining about his fall in the woods (if a tree falls in the woods does anybody care?) 
and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> couldn't figure out where to have the On In ... Once they all swung low, <font 
color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font> called one of her many satellite friends and lead them to The Assonet Inn.&nbsp; What 
a find.&nbsp; A juke box with country music, Milwaukee's Best beer and liver and onions for <font color="#FF0000">Basket 
Boom Boom</font> and boneless buffalo chicken.&nbsp; This is the recipe for even better sewage than <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo's</font> chile ... I'm sure everyone was thinking of the hash early the next morning on the throne....</p>

<p>On On</p>
