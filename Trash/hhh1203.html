about angry property owners foiling his original trail plans, so it was obvious 
that this trail would suck. And it did. And there was pavement. And more 
pavement. Concrete. Asphalt. Macadam. Whatever. Only a few were dumb enough to 
show up. Note to hash: if <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> is hare and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> doesn’t show (or vice versa), you might as well 
just pack up and head for the nearest bar.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNoSpacing><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Trail started 
out briefly on the bike path, before turning right into some lightly wooded 
shiggy. But not for long. They came out to a check on the bike path that had 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> continuing west on the path, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> wandering around in some nice garbage-laden shiggy 
along the river. The rest were guided by the hare onto Bridge Street, headed 
south. After what seemed like endless miles of this inhumane pavement-pounding, 
they crossed the river at Factory St. and found a check. And another graded path 
heading north along the river.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNoSpacing><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This path (also 
paved!) led to a check which sent <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> uphill to some 
athletic fields. Trail went parallel to the fields along to an apartment 
complex. It then led down some abandoned stairs to a parking lot for the VFW, K 
of C, BPOE or whatever. It was not particularly challenging to follow, so <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> was soon lost. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
continued to lead.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNoSpacing><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">A check led out 
to Providence St heading east. More endless miles of bone-jarring concrete, 
until a check at a stone wall sent <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> southwest on 
some powerlines. There were some briars. There was some mud. But nowhere near 
enough to satisfy, let alone brag about. The powerlines turned east, and coming 
up a hill, the beer check was found. No pavement for at least 300 yds! The beer 
was found and enjoyed, unlike the run so far. But the enjoyment was clouded by 
the fact that it was inevitable that, to get back to the cars, more miles and 
miles of shin-stabbing agony would have to be endured.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNoSpacing><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Trail back 
reversed itself on the powerlines, mainly to give the illusion that one had 
spent at least SOME quality time in shiggy. Back on the road, trail crossed into 
an industrial parking lot, and then back on the (paved!) bike path. They crossed 
the bridge by the soap factory, disappointed in the lack of even olfactory 
shiggy. They limped back to the cars, and circled in the bushes on the other 
side. Ratings for the run: two quality bimbos and no <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> could not make up for the worn shoes, shin splints 
and jarred kidneys caused by all that pavement. Total -6.9! Hashit went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. On On On was at a nearby pub, with crap beer and an 
open mike comedy night. As if we hadn't had enough, already!</SPAN></P>
