<p>Wanting to give <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, cursed from hashing by taking a job in Boston, an opportunity to 
hash, the hare decided to begin the run from the Providence train station.  Despite the horn calls by <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> (catching the attention of a local cop), no <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> showed.  
In fact, no <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> showed, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, no <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, and no <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>.  This might be the very first hash not to be 
described as ‘pathetic’, ‘suck’, ‘horrible’, or ‘a complete waste of time’.  The brilliance by the missing geriatrics 
was only offset by the 33% bimbo population, thanks to <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font>.</p>

<p>They were off heading toward Providence Place, down by the river, underneath Union Station, through the skating rink, 
a weak attempt to sucker the hashers onto I-195, then to the courtyard of the Cathedral of St. Peter & Paul.  With about 
20 different potential directions, trail was difficult, but soon found heading west crossing I-95 over Weybossett St.  
Soon they were heading west on Broadway, where <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> failed to find true trail through 
the Federal Hill plaza, thus adding unnecessary miles and miles of pavement pounding.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> met with the hare at Pleasant Valley Parkway, and they reversed trail to find 
the others.  The hare pointed <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font>, and 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> onto true trail, while punishing <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> into a long 
circle-jerk around the Woonasquatucket River.  There was a blue crane in the river which made everyone ooohh and awwwwe.  
A beer check was reached atop a hill at Davis Park.  Everyone was giddy with excitement having no worries about the likes 
of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, and 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>.</p>

<p>After the beer check, they headed east along Chalkstone, Smith, past the State House to the starting point at the 
train station.  Hiding in plain sight, they decided to circle there.  Ratings for the run were off the charts, given 
those who were NOT present.  Total: +69!  Brilliant!  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> for no 
reason whatsoever.</p>

<p>On-on-on was at Trinity Brewhouse were fine beer was savored.  A cake was presented to the birthday girl <font 
color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font>, and hashers being hashers, a boisterous “Happy Birthday F*ck You” was sung with 
much love and affection.  All in all, this hash will go down in the hashing annals as perhaps the best hasher ever!!!.</p>
