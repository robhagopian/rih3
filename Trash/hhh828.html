Boston H3: Call me 1-310-949-4526 and I'll tell you as there were far too many. Rumour has it that there were more 
Boston hashers than native cape-coders on the islands that day!</p>

<p><i><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">The RUN:</font></i></p>
<p>You may be wondering as to why this write-up took so long. I've been glued to the computer each day for 3-4 hours 
straight trying to write something nice to say, but alas! The run sucked! But here goes anyway...</p>

<p>The event was dubbed the 1st annual Cape-Cod hash. For the record,the 1st Cape-Cod run, which was such a success that 
no-one has dared to follow it up as an annual event for fear of cumming up short, was hared by <font color="#FF0000">
TrailHoover</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Cod</font> and yours truly.</p>

<p>People woke from the night before with blurry memories, wet pajamas, no clothes on, puking and the taste of urine in 
their mouths, to the sweet smell of bacon and eggs as the harriettes treated the lot to hot breakfast.</p>

<p>Some hashers drove in that day incl. boston contingent <font color="#FF0000">ShineOn</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
PencilDick</font> and <font color="#FF0000">CumsAlone</font>. The latter was trying to drive and insert a vaginal 
diaphragm with spermicidal ceam but instead poked her eye with it!! Disabled as such, she enjoyed the pity from others. 
but soon the horror descended upon the hash: if she isn't running, she can't scribe. What?! No CumsAlone write-up? 
OMIGOD. This was a weekly event the BH3 cherished as much as their 30-odd emails/day; as much as George W. his 3 death 
sentences per week; as much as <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> disrobing twice per hash; as much as Bondo uttering 
F@£K 50 times/day...well, you get the message. So with sad hearts the hash commenced.</p>

<p>The trail was pre set. The hares chose to further make this event memorable by inventing new marks that looked like 
space-ships, vaginas and crabs as interpreted by a 5 year old clearly influenced by <font color="#FF0000">Pollock</font>. 
</p>

<p>The hash set off down the road, and stumbled on one check after another as the trail remained on road. It was to be a 
brilliant strategy as the hares carefully avoided the acres of shiggy/woods/grass all around by keeping them on narrow, 
serpentine roads that were poorly marked by the municipality, and could have been easily lost had it not been for the 
FRBs <font color="#FF0000">TrailHoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">DrWHO</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">PuffN'Stuff
</font> also kept in the lead but kept falling behind everytime he sniffed urine on some lampost as he was cleary having 
difficulty withdrawing( and <font color="#FF0000">Lube Me In</font> had decided wisely to leave earlier). Compost would 
also have been in the lead had he also not left. It was rumoured he drove to Woonsocket and both he and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were seen commiting unspeakable acts of sadomasochism on each other with Ben and Jake-now 
fallen from disgrace from the GM position-joining in when they could. <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> chimed in 
with the local birds with her dainty &quot;on on&quot; every now and then.</p>

<p>And just before the hash was going to abandon trail and explore the acres of shiggy/wetlands Harwich had to offer, 
they stumbled onto the BC. It was here the hash found their most stimulating/exciting moment of the day:Finding the BEER. 
Alas there was no beer to be found at the beach unless it was swept away to sea. The hares arrived, with the beer soon 
after, unable to understand how the pack could have navigated itself thru such a cleverly laid trail. Beer was consumed 
and the temp dipped-indicative of what was to come. Songs were sung by all, and everyone enjoyed <font color="#FF0000">
Basket’s</font> German song so much they demanded an encore. <font color="#FF0000">DrWHO</font> regretted not packing 
his colonscope with which he would have happily examined <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> larynx.</p>

<p>Realizing just how exciting the hash had been and fears of demands of money being returned, the hares decided to 
strip. <font color="#FF0000">Cod</font> was upset that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Async
</font> wasn't around to appreciate his physique. The two bods however, bracing freezing temp and winds, stripped to 
their bathing suits. The low temp ensured there would be little stirring in the lads’ pants, however nothing stopped 
Baxter from getting excited, but unable to ascend the steps, he ascended the vertically challenged friar’s dog. <font 
color="#FF0000">Deep</font> had forgotten her own brassiere and like the poor girl in the song...&quot;she let those 
bastards swing swing swing!&quot;</p>

<p>The trail now ran across the beach for about another mile to the 2nd beer check where Olympic stone throwing was won 
by the Scandinavian Bib <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. Beer and songs consumed, the hash retreated back to the 
house.</p>

<p>The circle up commenced with the hares called in for another striptease and down-downs. Virgins/visitors were called 
in and said nothing memorable. Back in the house, the hash enjoyed a meal that improved from the day before a 
thousand-fold, including soup, Portuguese sausage and salad. Great grub, girls! One by one, late into the eve, the hash 
left the cape with few memories...not that it wasn't a good run, but because of good beer for once at the Boston 
hash...</p>

<p>ONON.</p>
