<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Clowns in Freetown Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #996</font>, May 9, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; SESYB</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Freetown/Fall River State Forest.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 40’s, Partly Cloudy.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Basket Boom Boom, Oozing SD, Dry Foot Fairy, Tinker, Dr WHO, 
WIPOS, Seamus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>This was yet another rehash of previous runs, “justified” only because the hare had been so proud of her trail the 
last time she set here. She thought she could get away with this blatant lack of creativity because before, only 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> showed up, and they aren’t exactly known for 
their long-term memories. At any rate, the turn out was only marginally better this night.</p>

<p>The run began promptly at 6:30. Trail entered the woods off Copicut Rd starting southeast, but soon curving to the 
west. The pack was on, except for <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, figuring a repeat, who turned downhill to the 
Rattlesnake Brook, off trail. He led <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to an unnecessary stream crossing. But the 
two soon picked up the trail again, just ahead of the pack. They headed southwest on the gas pipeline trail. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led left into the woods heading east.</p>

<p>A series of checks allowed the pack to catch up, and it was <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> who finally found 
true trail in a maze of bike paths and trails in a pine grove valley with steep hills in all directions.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed, with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> back with the hare. Generally east and slightly south, the trail crossed the 
main trails: the Daly Path and the Wampanoag Trail, sticking mostly to the dirt bike paths in order to take most 
advantage of the hills. There were puddles, but there was limited unavoidable shiggy. The only bushwhacking was 
shortcutting across switchbacks which allowed the leaders to switch position every now and then. Even the few crossings 
of Rattlesnake Brook were on bridges. A sad state hashing has come to!</p>

<p>Finally, the trail led to a loop.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
were dutifully suckered in this circle-jerk, and led <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> in a wide circle, thus allowing <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> to rejoin the pack. <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was able to further mislead the group by confusing an untried trail with the entering 
trail. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and the hare, avoiding the loop, had left an ambiguous mark at this check. Finally, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> west on a small path to Upper Ledge 
Rd.</p>

<p>By this time, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had headed for the quarry. Inside knowledge? Or just common sense? 
You be the judge! <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> had also given up and stuck with hare. <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot Fairy</font> had found about twenty-five multicolored, partially-deflated balloons. He decided to bring them along. 
This colorful apparition running northeast on the Haskall Path briefly led <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> astray. But while <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, giddy with his multicolor 
prancing about the woods, persisted without marks, the other two turned back to find true trail. [<font color="#FF0000">
Dry Foot</font> apparently made it to Bell Rock Rd. With no audience, he finally admitted defeat, and turned back. 
Unfortunately, he made the correct choices and re-entered the woods taking a left turn on Ledge Rd. But I digress.]</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was getting tired of this. He finally decided to head for the quarry also, knowing 
that the only logical spot for the beer check was atop the quarry cliff. He followed Upper Ledge Rd ignoring trail 
markings. And he arrived at the quarry only to be greeted by sight of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> standing at 
the edge of the 100 ft cliff. <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> cries of: “Jump! You can do it!” were ignored. He 
climbed up followed at some distance by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and, still further back by <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. The hare and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> were with <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>, and with the beer.</p>

<p>Before <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> could make the climb, the beers were distributed, and each took two or 
three to hide. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived, and there were none left. Ha Ha! What a joke! They laughed 
until they stopped! But they had mercy. Wankers! Next to arrive at the base of the cliff was <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font>. He was soon followed by a white car. Initially, it was thought that <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
had turned back for his car. But three unsuspecting teenagers emerged and got out of the car, rap music playing, to have a little toke. They were uncertain as to what to do about the crowd atop the cliff above them. But their uncertainties were crystallized when a cloud of fast-moving but colorful balloons burst through the woods behind them. <font color="#FF0000">
Dry Foot Fairy</font> had finally made it. He ignored the flour of the trail. He proceeded past the confused juvenile 
delinquents. He climbed up and joined the confused senile delinquents on the cliff. All to the strains of a rousing but 
inappropriate chorus of “Happy Birthday, F*ck you!” inspired by the sight of so many balloons. This was sufficient to 
convince the teens to pack their bongs and leave. Why do you think they call it “dope”?</p>

<p>The beer check proceeded with Guinness, a Porter and Cheetos. Attempts were made at throwing the balloons off the cliff. Against the wind. Brilliant! Finally, beer gone, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> was able to rid the party of the 
balloons by descending to a lesser outcropping and directing the balloons down the face of the cliff. They resumed the trail.  This was uneventful, proceeding north and west back to the pipeline. They all crossed the stream this time, and came out onto Copicut.</p>

<p>Two circles were initially formed. One was at a lovely and scenic holding pond, held by <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>. They had the prime location. 
They had the Cheetos. But they only had a half a Guinness each. The other circle was in a drab dirt roadway centering on 
a pathetic little mud puddle. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was there. But the hare was there. With the beer. 
Inevitably, the two circles rejoined. The run was rated. Balloons, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and no pavement 
offset the limited shiggy and the presence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Total <b>+6.9</b>. Hashit went to 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for the usual assortment of reasons.</p>

<p>After the circle ended, they convoyed over to T.K. O’Malley’s in Fall River for the On On On. With the group split 
up between two tables, the usual stupidities were thankfully somewhat limited. A quiet finish to the evening was enjoyed, 
the Red Sox crushing Oakland, the food and beer relatively cheap and not a bottle of malt vinegar to be seen.</p>
