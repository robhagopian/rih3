Two days before Christmas and it was the time of year where all RIH3 hashers dread the thought of sitting on Santa's lap. Would Bondo show, could it Basket again, or would that udder white bearded one show? Alas, Tinker was abroad and decided to stay there rather than have some old farts sit on his thighs.<br>

This was the pot luck and yank me swap day, Flo had promised nothing and we expected less. Rumor had it that HoleMiner was en route from way down south, this had something to do with the fact that the RIH3 cannot organize the road trip to see her in PA. <br>

Things were looking a little light as we approached the 2pm start, the virgin had markings explained to him whereas the rest of us glanced streetwards in anticipation of cars speeding to the start of this annual festive affair. The pack of 12 headed out, the hare had some kind of head cold and decided to join us at the last minute for the short pre-set trail. There are some words that mean different things in different places, at a hash event short conjures up many images but none worse than when this word is followed by the word trail. <br>

We pounded pavement for a while, came across a check a short distance out, whereupon one of the neighbors asked what's happening, to which Rusty replied nothing yet, her final retort was is there a child missing. No, was the swift response to this very strange statement and on we went in search of beer.<br>

The Clapper & Wee Balls led the pack through the ball field and out onto the single train track, not sure which way the track was going but more importantly there were no trains running today. Fuwangi was seen to the take a right at a check that had been kicked, this was actually a bad trail as found by Basket. We continued on tracks for a while and then entered the woods. The pack was well spread out, WHO could be heard in the distant past and LB & Hairy were nowhere to be seen. DogMeat and Just Keri took the short walk directly to the beer stop as did Oozie the late arriving short cutting bastard.<br>

Basket stopped at an old mates house, Rusty thought it was a beer stop and made trail through several yards to get there before the rest of the pack arrived. It was a bad move, Basket only stopped for a chat and soon they were back on trail again.<br>

The beer stop took place atop a rock (what a surprise!) and a few songs were sung. Oozie took the biscuit when he decided that Pissonya's dog (dressed as a candy cane) was actually a prop for something that would receive an X rating elsewhere. We sang some more, romanticized about those not there, and then decided that another beer was a far better thing to dwell upon. A short downhill stroll brought us back to Flo's and we circled up in the driveway that you couldn't park in.<br>

The run was given a good rating because there was no SheMaleMan, Bondo or WIPOS! Perhaps a first, but Oozie receiving the hash shit award was by far the most entertaining moment. We adjourned upstairs whereupon we all sat on LB's thighs, one at a time. She made a far better Santa than those in previous years, the gifts were outstanding and resulted in many a swap being made before each found its final resting place. Dr. WHO quietly pulled #1 out of the hat during the drawing of numbers and he quietly hung onto this until he got to swap his Phuck NY t-shirt for a pure silver Hip Flask full of Irish Whiskey Fuwangi was not a happy camper.<br>
