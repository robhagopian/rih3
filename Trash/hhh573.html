<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The directions for this run, as always, when given
by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> were
pathetic, as the run start was at Burriville school. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the
web directions said Glendale Middle School, no wonder we don’t get many
Hashers together! But we Hashers are persistent bastards and by 2.10pm
although the hare (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">),
was not present the following managed to overcome the poor directions,
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck, Beyond Hope, Async, Gobble Gobble,
Itchy Brother, Oozing Syph, Bondo Jovi, Jovi Juice, Jake, Shine on Harvard
Moon</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> (Boston), </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shiggy
Pitts</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> (Boston), </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ciderman</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
(NYH3), </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">(Newport
H3), </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rhody Cash </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">(Newport
H3) and yours truly. A hot steamy day with expectations high. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finally our Hare for the day, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
showed up a little bit on the wet side. The pack set off and very soon
were stretched with your scribe chasing up the rear as usual after taking
the first two checks in the wrong direction, with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
flying off in all directions with whistles going off everywhere, you are
only supposed to blow them when you are on trail-Dopey! Everyone at some
point expecting to cross water which is </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket's</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
tradition, were surprised to finally get to a derelict building for the
beer check. Up to this point it was poorly marked false trails, lots of
brambles and bloody long. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The beer stop was welcome in the heat of the day
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">got
very involved with the singing having orgasms at every verse where female
genitalia was mentioned. Our band leader (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket)</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
led the singing for this large turnout. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">must spend at least one day a week sitting
in the bog at work practicing these songs as he always comes up with a
fresh one, a song that is. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The second half of this run was slightly different
to the front half with the pack setting off up hill down through a few
checks very soon to find, surprise, surprise-a water crossing, the flour
led us to rope which showed us the exit point, one after the other we swam
across this grotty germ infested shit, thinking the worst was over, only
to be confronted by black knee deep shiggy, great for keeping your skin
young looking-thank you </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
Then the hare provided another swim to wash off the previous shit, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
tried to monkey climb the crossing on the second rope, but finally let
go to be up to his neck in more crappy water. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
laughing like a Hyena, but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> had
somehow avoided these great crossings. The owners of the said properties
we crossed were present to watch these events, but were speechless by the
time the last of us had gone past, these poor miserable bastards only coming
out to collect their newspapers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The run trail finally taking us up to the start
point. The circle up was at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket’s</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
pad with Down Downs for short cutting bastards, guests and newcomers (none,
due to the fact they could not find the poxy start). The hare was finally
given a 1.6x10 to the minus 69 and accused that it was too dry, our resident
Hashshit wearer </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing Syph</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was yet again nominated for this prestigious award, he in fact could be
the longest Hashshit wearer in the history of the RIH3, historical documents
will need to be checked to confirm this rumor, a suggestion was made that
he should stitch it to his running attire or his Dick (to Phone). Another
good run set by the water beast of Rhode Island-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
Boom Boom</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">. As always good grog and grub on
a truly memorable day-Good job you bastard! On-On</FONT></P>
