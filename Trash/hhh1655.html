Another merry jaunt through Lincoln Woods! There was a decent amount of
bushwacking on the first leg (across the street from The Lodge) out to a
Whisky check where Rusty made sure to abandon his offspring by leaving
before she got there. Trail went back across the road and into a little
segment to the north west of The Lodge involving a water crossing and some
beer. On-After at The Lodge with surprisingly little popcorn being thrown
around.
