<p><font color="#008000">Run #1007</font>, July 17, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; West Greenwich, RI (Big River Management Area).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 80’s, hazy hot and humid.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket, Bondo, Dr. WHO, Dry Foot Fairy, Tinker (a.k.a. Just Rachael), 
Trail Hoover (SESYB), Great at Giving Head (transplant from Silicon Valley H3), Just Nathaniel, Seamus, and Ben.  
<font color="#0000FF">Visitor:</font>  Mr. Beanie Weenie (Tidewater H3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><i>Prelube:  8 p.m. on Sunday evening, the night before the hash and no directions from the hare.<br><br>
<blockquote>Ring-Ring<br><br>
Oozing: “Hey, Dry Foot.”<br><br>
Dry Foot: “Hey Oozing.  So are we going to have a hash tomorrow or what?”<br><br>
Oozing: “Oh man, I got so lost today scouting trail at Big River…”<br><br></blockquote>
With this omen, things could only get better (in other words, worse).</i><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not learning from the errors of their ways from the previous week, <font color="#FF0000">Great at Giving Head</font> 
(hereon referred to as <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>) and his friend <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> 
rolled in to be greeted by the usual bunch of wankers who were slowly gathering along the side of Burnt Sawmill Rd. in 
the Big River Management Area.  Appreciative to find this band of idiots, <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> 
became hare #2 and offered bottles of beer for a much needed pre-lube.  Now these are the type of virgins RIH3 needs to 
recruit!  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> (hares #3 & 4) tried to make this a 
bike hash.  Since they were the only ones with bikes, they decided to hash by themselves.  Nobody seemed to care.  The 
hash didn’t even start and hashit already found its new owner.  Brilliant!.</p>

<p>Visiting <font color="#FF0000">Mr. Beanie Weenie</font> from Tidewater H3 (Virginia) pulled in puffing a cigarette.  
After Cady’s on February 28th (<a href="hhh986.html">Hash #986</a>), most were drooling for a puff (on what, I won’t 
speculate, but you can… anyway, I digress).  While everyone waited around for <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> 
to arrive, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, wanting to puff on something, decided to blow <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> faucet to see if he could make something come out… A noise!  Success!  Not only has <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> turned <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> spout into a make-shift horn, but he created a 
new hashit as well.  Brilliant!</p>

<p>The unmotivated pack finally got underway running south along Burnt Sawmill Rd. and quickly reached an arrow pointing 
west into the woods.  Not finding any trails during his scouting mission, the hare decided to groom some trails on his 
own with his weed-whacker.  How nice.  <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, 
a.k.a. <font color="#FF0000">Just Rachael</font>, surreptitiously stayed at the rear with the hare, as <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> became hare #5 and proceeded to blaze his own trail after the first check (nothing unusual 
though).  Wanting to impress his new hashing pals, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> ran with enthusiasm as the FRB.  He 
impressed nobody.  Brilliant!</p>

<p>Led by <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Mr. Beanie Weenie</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font>, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
followed an over-marked trail (with no checks) for miles and miles along the banks of Big River.  With everyone 
disappointed that trail didn’t go into the obvious river, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> abruptly stopped at an “X” on 
trail.  Of course, those there had to go and see the falsie for themselves (<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could trust 
a hasher named <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>? <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could trust another hasher period?  
But I digress).  Slowly, they spread out and reversed the trail to find a hidden check or something.  After about a 
half-mile, they reached an arrow not previously on trail pointing east.  This mark was laid by hare #6 (<font 
color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>) after suckering the others down the long falsie.  Brilliant!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Beanie Weenie</font> soon caught the new hare <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, 
turning northeast.  Each check appeared to go straight for a while.  At a check close to Burnt Sawmill Rd., <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> decided to cross the road where he encountered an arrow.  Thinking he was on true trail, 
he whistled to bring others along.  They smartly ignored his calls, as he was back at the beginning of the trail.  He 
would have re-run the entire trail if it were not for <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> correcting the mistake.  
Brilliant!</p>

<p>Returning to true trail, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> encountered <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (very 
close to where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> left the pack at the beginning of the run).  The trio soon found the 
beer check, set by hare #7 (<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, a.k.a. <font color="#FF0000">Just Rachael</font>) on a 
small bridge next to Capwell Mill Pond.  Beer was opened to the relief of all.  However, the beer supply soon dwindled, 
even with <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> missing.  So <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> (hare #1) had to go back to his car to fetch more beer.  Brilliant!</p>

<p>With a boost to the beer reserve, the hare broke the daunting news that this was all the beer he had.  Fear, shock, 
disappointment, disbelief, confusion all hit the hashers like an avalanche of overpowering emotions!  Almost out of beer!  
The hare wanted to circle at the beer check, but he was overruled by all the other hares.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knew that there was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew back at his truck, so they 
finished the beer check, this time, without anyone trying to make their rhubarb rise.  Brilliant!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> provided his first, only, and likely last positive contribution to the hash and 
offered up his <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew for the circle.  The ratings for the run seemed to be anything but 
a mathematical derivative of 69; however, given no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> on trail, <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> mostly off trail, a visitor with an iron lung, the collective rating did in fact manage to 
equal +0.6.9.  Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> for trying to be like <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  
Brilliant!</p>

<p>In a quest for more beer, they moseyed on to Marks for the On-On-On.  Nobody got lost this time, since they were 
already on Exit 6 not 6A.  Pitchers of Guinness and Bass were ordered so that everyone enjoyed a perfect, then ruined 
black and tan.  When will they ever learn?  At least no <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> IPA this time.  The poor 
performance by the Red Sox was offset by the quality beer and those smart enough to order scallop rolls, namely <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, a.k.a. <font color="#FF0000">Just Rachael</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font>.  Brilliant!</p>

<p>For some reason that could only defy logic, most sat around in the parking lot not wanting to leave.  Only <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> had the good sense to depart.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Seamus</font>, disgusted by the scene, decided to show his master how a real man pisses… on <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker’s</font>, a.k.a. <font color="#FF0000">Just Rachael’s</font>, car.  And with that, yet another 
complete waste of an evening concluded.  Brilliant!</p>

<p><blockquote><font size="2"><i><b>Life:</b> a perpetual pursuit. Some pursue happiness, eternal life or money. For a 
lot of people, its a pursuit of virgins. Getting tired from the same mundane situation/person, we look afar for greener 
pastures. The RIH3 has fallen victim to this rat race-searching for virginal trails, at the cost of quality hashes. Oozing 
brings his eastern wisdom and patience to the next hash:an education of how to continue to milk the most excitement out of 
an old, all too familiar ally. Altho' the lure of a virgins fresh skin and innocent exhuberence may be inviting, one 
leaves with a sense of being "ripped off". Not this Monday!<br>
