<p><font color="#008000">Run #1073</font>, October 23, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Good Times Pub, Rt 114, Cumberland</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 50's Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish It Head, Great at Giving Head, Candy Kaner, Justin My Ass, Eenie 
Weenie Dick, Bondo Jovi, Async, WIPOS, Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Run #1073 was the first of the gentle, attractive (<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> excluded), good time hashes for 
the RIH3.  With a good number of the group halfway around the world at the Interhash we finally had some peace and quiet.  
Plus with the reduced number of wankers we had a better female to male ratio, even though <font color="#FF0000">Candy 
Kaner</font> was still the only attending harriette.</p>

<p>Was the fact that this hash started at “Good Times” pub a coincidence?  I think not!</p>

<p>Trail led east out across 114 and into the neighborhood on Phillip Ave.  Phillip merged into Pequot Ave and the first 
check was encountered at Hines Rd.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> blazed north with <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Candy Kaner</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> following not far behind.  The 
others?  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cares!  A second check was encountered at Waumsett Ave and <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> following north with cohorts <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Candy Kaner</font>.  
Good times, good times.  <font color="#FF0000">Asnyc</font> found true trail east into the woods, and soon enough all 
followed.</p>

<p>A little bush whacking occurred to get the group to the powerlines, with true trail (and <font color="#FF0000">Async
</font>) leading us southeast.  After a bit another check showed up, with straight leading east toward’s Miller’s River, 
and southeast leading into……..well, parts of Miller’s River, although this part was more swamp-like.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> was the first dummy to proceed through the swamp, although we have to admit that it was a 
gentle, attractive and well-mannered swamp.  Good times, good times.  Continuing along the powerlines he passed a guy 
drinking a beer on a dirtbike, and calling “on-on” assumed that others were in close pursuit.  At the next check he went 
left, eastward and uphill.  This proved to be a pretty long false trail, but turning his light out he managed to sucker 
<font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie Dick</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> there as well.  By the time 
the three stooges made it back to true trail the rest had caught up, and passed, continuing along the powerlines.  
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows where <font color="#FF0000">Candy Kaner</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> were.  Actually, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
might have known.</p>

<p>Another check has us turning farther east into an area of woods that reminded more than one of the Blair Witch 
Project.  Trail marks ended.  Random cars showed up.  Ends up we were on the outskirts of a junkyard, makes sense.  After 
running around in circles for a bit someone managed to find a trail mark heading southward toward the quarry.  With 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> leading the way the group finally managed to make it to a large boulder, the top of 
which was the beer check.  Good times, good times!</p>

<p>The hare brought hot nuts, 60min IPA and some pretty damn Oatmeal Stout, although <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
wouldn’t admit it.  A few songs were sung, but mainly the group enjoyed the silence.  The wonderful, wonderful silence.  
And just as they came, the group left – back down the boulder and onto the trail that brought them in.</p>

<p>Despite a trail leading back to the cars that encompassed about 80% bushwhacking, everyone continued on with high 
spirits.  How could we not?  Ending up on the powerlines, and then Indiana Ave and Colonial Ave a quick trip was made back 
to Good Times via 114.</p>

<p>With nighttime already upon us and a chill in the air the attractive, gentle group rounded up some beer and headed into 
the woods.  Comments on the run included “No <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>.  No <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
.  No <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>.”  Need we say more?  Mathematical total: <b>+69!!!</b>  Hashit went to 
<font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> for bringing Ben back with us to the cars.  With <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> back 
in the woods this was his chance to encounter the front end of a high-speed vehicle.  Boo on <font color="#FF0000">G@GH
</font>.  The group proceeded up to Tucks and had a pretty kick-ass dinner despite an unusually large crowd.  Good times, 
good times.</p>
