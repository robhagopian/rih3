<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Hash That Deserves No Name</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1075</font>, November 6, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Eenie Weenie Dick</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Waterman Ave., North Providence</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 40’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Great at Giving Head, Amish It Head, Candy Caner, Dry Foot Fairy, Dr WHO, 
Microhard, Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Seamus, Ben. Virgin: Just Brian.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Basket</font>.</p>

<p>The hare lazily decided to start from his home grounds in North Providence, a locale with nothing whatsoever to 
recommend it. And this hash as it turned out will undoubtedly go a long way towards discouraging <font color="#FF0000">
Microhard</font> from keeping up his infrequent visits.  The group set off at 6:30 as always, northwest on Rt 104 from the 
start near the junction of 104 and 44.</p>

<p>Jogging along on pavement, there was a falsie to the left that <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> followed all the way 
through some briars to the riverbank. He encouraged <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> to do the same. After emerging, the 
rest saw that it =was a falsie. But the late arriving <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was dispatched without much 
effort in the same trap, and so was left behind. They then crossed into a neighborhood a little further upstream on 
Gladstone. The FRB’s easily made it following trail through some homeowner’s yard. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was 
still trailing. Enough so that the irate homeowner was able to pop out and give him a piece of his mind. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> can sure use it!</p>

<p>Back out onto Rt 104, and back northwest they went. Another falsie down Esmond Mill Dr was followed and led by <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Brian</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font>, they entered some shiggy, crossed a small 
branch stream and found the “X”. Naturally, they waited until all made the crossing. <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> 
found a way to cross which kept his feet dry by clinging to a chain link fence over a small bridge, and most elected to 
use this for their return trip.</p>

<p>Trail continued, northwest on Rt 104. The hash was clearly in a rut. The stragglers regrouped to find <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> returning from a southwest recce on Esmond street. There was some aimless wandering about. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> took off through a parking lot and some woods.  He ended up on Leland Mowry Dr. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> blazed ahead on Waterman, and blew by the trail markings to run into <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font>. The rest found the true trail on the east bank of the river for a short bushwhack, coming out to resume on 
pavement on High Street. They regrouped. Trail led to Fernwood, and a check at the Portuguese Social club sent the pack 
west onto the playing fields behind the club.</p>

<p>Markings were scarce here, and a police squad car pulled in at the north end of the fields, discouraging the use of 
lights and horns. Trail led to the riverbank. It seemed the hare wanted the pack to cross. There was no effective way of 
judging depth, but the hare appeared on the opposite bank. He had beer. So led by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> they crossed, thigh-high in the rapidly moving water. <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were missing. But unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> showed 
up, and despite the group quieting down and turning off lights, he found the BC and made the crossing.</p>

<p>The BC was marked by some rhubarb songs, and close monitoring of the policeman’s headlights, still visible through the 
trees. Finally, they were off. Now how to get back? They followed an old trolley line back to, you guessed it, Rt 104! 
They went southeast. And they continued southeast. Familiar marks were present. There was a lot of pavement. In a 
southeasterly way. They finished up with a southeast sprint to the hares and grouped up for the circle in the back.</p>

<p>Ratings on the run were predictable: a nice stream crossing and a few pathetic falsies could not even begin to make up 
for the northwest and southeast pavement. It costs money to replace soles on shiggy shoes, and the hash suffered 
substantial wear this night. Total: <b>-6.9</b>. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. I think. On On On was 
at Stuffies on Mineral Spring. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> can remember these things that long ago? And <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cares?</p>
