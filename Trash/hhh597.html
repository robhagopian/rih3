<P><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">The Start:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;
AAA Office Parking Lot, Warwick</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Hare, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket Boom Boom</FONT>, started this
hash from the AAA office parking lot on Rte 117 Warwick.&nbsp; The assembling
hashers included <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo, Jake, Async, Oozing</FONT>,
and late arriving <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Shine On</FONT>.&nbsp; Directions
were given and the pack was on trail.&nbsp; Crossing Commonwealth Ave.,
the pack followed flour up the steps to the church, through the parking
lot, and onto the power lines.&nbsp; A check fooled everyone, including
the hare, and true trail was finally found by <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>.&nbsp;
After checking out the Indian Totem Pole, the trail led onto street and
back into the power lines before reaching Rte 2.

<P>A couple of shiggy areas led <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Hopeless</FONT>,
followed by <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Shine On</FONT>, off trail looking for
dry ground.&nbsp; The briars were too much, and both had to settle for
shiggy tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozing</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async</FONT>
found trail on the other side of Rte 2, but failed to find the False Trail
marking.&nbsp; They continued on a falsie for such a long time, that the
hare had to go out a save their asses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Back on trail again,
the splintered pack made its way to the beer stop.

<P>The ingenious hare laid flour into a corn field, and beer was found
deep within.&nbsp; Feeling like the Children of the Corn, we enjoyed Pete’s
Wicked and a couple of songs, under a bright sky.&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>,
in his ever-impatient state, after finishing his beer, started off looking
for trail.&nbsp; We all finished our beers and joined him.&nbsp; The trail
led deeper into the corn field, and eventually out to a condominium development.&nbsp;
The pack was confused as we approached a small pond, but eventually found
flour going out to the middle of the pond on a series of bridges, and out
the opposite bank.&nbsp; It was here the most desperate of the pack struck
out against the hare, and dragged him into the pond by <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Hopeless</FONT>.&nbsp;
It was no small fete, and was only accomplished with the help of <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>.&nbsp;
Wet and cold, the hare lost his opportunity to return the favor, but another
opportunity will present itself on another hash.

<P>Back at the parking area, a circle was formed in the adjoining woods,
where the hare received his deserved Down-down.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Beyond
Hope</FONT> received the Hashit for his despicable act, and others for
less memorable offenses.&nbsp; The pack then traveled to the Sport Page
pub, for grub and Bass Ale.&nbsp; Our waitress, a healthy girl, spotted
the likes of us, and new she was in for a treat.&nbsp; First question,
“What is the most beautiful thing in the world?”&nbsp;&nbsp; “A vagina,
of course”, she answered.&nbsp; Smart girl, and she wasn’t even gay.&nbsp;
Said she liked fucking too much, but she spotted us as that kind of people.&nbsp;
You just got to love the hash.
