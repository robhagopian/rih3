<p><font color="#008000">Run #1087</font>, January 29, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Justin My Ass</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Providence, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 20s, clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish Ithead, Oozing, Basket, Bondo, Dr. WHO, Seamus, Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Where does one begin?  The Robbie Burns hash is usually one to be celebrated.  One to be remembered, one to be used for 
comparison to the previous year’s run, and one to be used as a basis for judgment for the following year’s run.  This one 
was neither.  Or none.  Or the opposite of all, depending on your English grammar skills.</p>

<p>Starting at the parking lot at 50 Holden St in Providence we knew right off the bat it’d be a pavement-filled run and 
not at all comparable to the hash of 2006 put on by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> in Glocester.  But giving the hare 
the benefit of the doubt a few unlucky wanks showed up, kilts adorn, for what they hoped would be another fun-filled 
Monday night.  <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> stated that marks were made in chalk, blue chalk, which the he 
apparently found on sale.  The sale must not have been a good one though, as marks were to be almost non-existent and 
extremely spread apart.  But I’m getting ahead of myself; let’s go back to the start.</p>

<p>Out of the lot the trail went left, up Holden, according to the hare.  A faint “mark” was noticed but no more until the 
intersection of Holden and Smith St was encountered.  Here a “check” was found, again according to the hare, and everyone 
proceeded right towards the capital and downtown Providence.  After crossing over 95, the hare took the lead because the 
“marks” he put down apparently disappeared at night.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> followed along, but <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> must have sensed the 
debacle that was to occur ahead and went right on Gaspee St towards the mall to, what I can only assume, stare at the hot 
high school chicks in the food court.  Smart, smart <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> – you won’t hear that phrase too 
often!!</p>

<p>The hare continued to lead <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> down Smith St 
confused at where his “marks” had gone, and finally one was noticed at the intersection at Canal St.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had shown up late, and although their horns could be 
heard in the distance they were never seen, I can only hope they’d joined <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  A quick 
jaunt through Roger Williams National Memorial Park had us encounter the only “shiggy” on trail, and once on the other 
side the confused hare was unable to determine which side street his trail truly followed.  Pathetic!  <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, once again, never saw any of his magic “marks.”  After 
deciding that uphill was the only way to go, the group proceeded and eventually made a right onto Congdon St.  This was 
followed a bit until a right was made and yadda yadda yadda, no “marks” were found.  A side trip through RISD, a side trip 
through Brown and the hare finally decided that going to the beer check was the best thing to do.  Downhill to Benefit and 
to the Wild Colonial it was.</p>

<p>And what a crappy beer check.  With only <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
present the hare thought he’d get away cheap.  Especially since he hadn’t warned anyone to bring IDs and <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> was denied at the bar.  Crap!  After their single beers were downed hats went on and towards 
the door they went when <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> face pressed against the window.  Both he and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> made it, somehow, but that only prolonged <font color="#FF0000">Amish’s</font> suffering as 
he watched the others drink beers while he had an empty hand.  After round #2 had been consumed everyone departed, heading 
right on South Main St and while <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> smartly headed straight to his shaggin’ wagon, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> followed the hare 
and his “marks” into the city.</p>

<p>The hare had in his mind a direction his trail was to follow, but the others could care less and continued up towards, 
and eventually into the mall.  A few confused gestures were thrown in the kilted members directions, the best was when a 
group of thugs called out a “yo, we be diggin’ yo clothes.”  How can you not look fly with a kilt?  Respect the Irish pimp 
hand, bitch!</p>

<p>A trip up the escalator and a walk through the Gap had us in the parking lot which we followed to ground level and out, 
heading back up towards the capital, Smith St and finally the parking lot on Holden St where <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> was waiting.  A quick circle was held in the back lot, but broken up fairly fast when an old rent-a-cop came by to 
tell us we were on private property.  After telling him we were almost done he took off, only to come back 5min later.  
Thinking we were taking a group piss, he said do it back behind the fence and eventually left us to ourselves for the 
completion.</p>

<p>Despite the mass quantity of pavement, the mass lack of “marks,” and <font color="#FF0000">Amish’s</font> lack of beer 
the positives of no <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> at the beer check, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> on just 
about all of the trail and some friendly comments at the mall had the group in good spirits.  <b>+0.69</b> – wow.  It was 
hard to pass out the hashit due to everyone being spread out on trail – how could you point out crimes when you couldn’t 
see anyone else?  Noticing that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had headed to his van before the circle was over, he 
was a good enough candidate, and everyone agreed.</p>

<p>Everyone convened at Tommy’s Place around the corner for the on-on-on.  A good little Irish pub, although unfamiliar 
with Robbie Burns.  Warm haggis was enjoyed, Guinnesses were downed and even Tommy came by for a little song.  All in all, 
a much better way to end the night than the run started the night.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>ever has next year’s 
Robbie Burns hash has it made – can’t get worse than this!</p>
