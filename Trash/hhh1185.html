Run:<br> </font><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hare had 
been unable to convince his better half and co-hare <FONT color=#ff0000>Swamp 
Whine</FONT> to even show up for this one.&nbsp;He decided to set a trail worthy 
of her RI name. It was pretty obviously going to enter La Salette at some point, 
so the hare decided to live set a portion of the trail to foil the short-cutters 
plans at skipping the first half of trail. This was wise, and ultimately 
effective. It was a lovely evening. No bimbos were dumb enough to show. The 
Boston crew arrived early and had some ice cream in the dairy. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>That’s A Mouthful</FONT> made a special appearance, possibly to 
announce his engagement. <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing </FONT>looked 
crushed.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail started 
off by crossing the road and circling the playing fields. Soon, all too soon, 
they entered the woods. Now to call this territory “woods” is more than a little 
misleading. There were trees, it’s true. But the words: bog, mire, swamp, tarn 
were closer to the truth. Pond would have been much more accurate, in fact. But 
led by <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>, the trail was dutifully followed due south, 
about 200- 300 yds in from the road. Why, you may ask, didn’t they just take to 
the road. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> did. Was it misplaced loyalty to the 
concept of actually following trail? Or did they fear missing a beer check 
placed within a half-mile of the start? Or were they just plain 
stupid?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The trail weaved 
around a bit, with marks on trees, and water depths between ankles and mid 
thighs. <FONT color=#ff0000>Mouthful</FONT> stated that the cold water from the 
tap at home in Puerto Rico was appreciably warmer than this. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Numb Nuts </FONT><FONT color=#000000>(after briefly living up to 
his name)</FONT>&nbsp;and <FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> (who always seems to 
live up to his name) in the rear soon retired or got lost or something. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> alternated 
the lead. <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> were at the point of just heading to the street, but 
each time they started to turn that way, someone would find another mark. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> by now was on the street. Luckily, he was headed in 
the wrong direction.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Finally, after 
30 minutes of prime swamp shiggy,&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> found the 
exit, across a small ravine and out to a driveway. Following this to the street, 
they turned north. The marks were pink chalk on telephone poles, thoughtfully 
created for the color-blind <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> found the turn into the main entrance to La Salette. 
The crowds were heavy, with all the lights ablaze for Christmas. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> were a big hit, in their Santa hats with 
headlights.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail circled 
counterclockwise, past the prayer stairs and the shrine, leading to the pond 
with the Stations of the Cross. A check sent <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> to 
the right (a traditionalist, starting with Station I) and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> to the left (a spawn of Satan, starting out at XIV). 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was right, and found trail diverging from the 
path, up a small hill to a large neon “Peace On Earth” sign, and in the 
distance, the figure of the hare beckoning. The hare was followed north, back 
into the woods behind the Maintenance Building, and alongside a small pond to 
the Beer Check.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The beer was 
opened, and the hashers gradually trickled in. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> 
even finally made it. And almost inexplicably, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT>. But it required several phone consultations to 
guide <FONT color=#ff0000>Numb Nuts</FONT> to the spot, and by the time he 
arrived, the beer was pretty much gone. Brilliant! Trail back was unmarked, and 
the group simply made their various ways back to the road, and turned north to 
the Dairy.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They circled up 
in some woods behind the Dairy. The run was rated: longest time in a swamp with 
water temps below 40, good Xmas decorations, several frankly blasphemous and 
ex-communicatable actions, and no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> were notable 
positives. But, lack of virgin territory (except for the Holy Virgin Mother, of 
course, but that doesn’t really count for this situation.), lack of bimbos and 
lack of lost hashers balanced. Total: -0! <FONT color=#ff0000>Mouthful</FONT> 
was punished as a major backslider, and plans were suggested to disrupt his 
wedding. Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, as usual. Finishing 
up, they convoyed over to Weatherlaines where they were unruly and unpleasant 
and the waitress was damn glad to see them go when the evening was finally over 
and they went on on into the night.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
