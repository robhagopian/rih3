<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Pre-emptive Lube (written on April 16, 2005):</b>  The Scribe, still 
being somewhat of a novice hasher, conducted a search through Hash Trash to establish an objective 
expectation for the up-cuming hare’s hash.  Here is a synopsis of what was discovered:</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“All were satisfied, basking in the afterglow of the ideal virgin hash.” (<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO 
Slasher</font>, #770)</p>

<p>“A brilliantly conceived run...” (<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, #910, Ratings: +69!)</p>

<p>“...the masterfully marked trail...” (<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, #919, Ratings: +0.69)</p>

<p>“Of course, the hare had set a brilliant run.  ...it would have been a perfect 10, but the hare had to settle...” 
(<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, #933, Ratings: 0.69)</p>

<p>“Another brilliant effort by the bad Doctor.” (<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, #937, Total: 6.9!)</p>

<p>“The outstanding hare once again set trail with yet another candidate for Run-Of-The-Year...  Just another jewel 
in the crowning achievements of this hare’s efforts!  ...Ratings were not necessarily all that high numerically, 
because no one wanted to embarrass the hare.  ...[the other pathetic wankers were] wracking their brains to think of 
ways to imitate (but never presume to equal) the outstanding trail...” (<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, #948, 
Total: 0.69!)</p>

<p>“A run so brilliant that even in summary, it shines out as the Run of the Year!” (<font color="#FF0000">Dr. 
WHO</font>, #958, Total: +0.69)</p>

<p>“Run of the Year!  ...It just doesn’t get any better than this.” (<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, #964, 
Total: +6.9!)</p>

<p>“The RIH3 was blessed with yet another outstanding run...” (<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, #973)</p>

<p>“An incredible virgin run, as expected...  BRILLIANT!  ...FANTASTIC!  ...UNBELIEVABLE!  ...MAGNIFICENT!” 
(<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, #983, Total: 6.9!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Incredibly, with such praise no superlative could come close to adequately describe the hare’s efforts, 
and no negative ratings on top of that!  The liberal use of the word “virgin” combined with a plethora of other 
sexual innuendoes got the Scribe so excited that he would no doubt cum early... to the hash.  Well, that's still 
to be determined.  At the very least, the Scribe will switch political parties and register as a 
Libertine.</i></p>

<p><i>And then the Scribe discovered the write-ups for the hare that <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> <u>DID 
NOT</u> author.  Here’s the synopsis:</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“...Upon my late father's indubitable assassination in 1999, I and my two sisters Mabooty and Matwatty were 
forced to flee our assurient homeland and proceed to nearby BONDOLAND.” [It’s obvious this write-up was authored 
by a schizophrenic lunatic, as this hash was nothing short of a torrent of inescapable horror.  Oh, the horror! 
The horror!!] (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD</font>, #896, +69!)</p>

<p>“Well, I guess <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> has finally reached that stage of life that we all dread 
in a Rhode Island hasher. That combination of incompetence, senility and laziness...” (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing 
SD</font>, #888, +6.9)</p>

<p>"Crimes, real and imagined, were identified and the innocent punished.” (<font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, 
#871)</p>

<p>“We were sure to have shiggy, something we long for in Rhode Island, but we have been sorely disappointed about 
lately.” (<font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font>, #863)</p>

<p>“...f*ckin’ moronic, f*ckin’ annoying son of a f*ckin’ b*tch.” (<font color="#FF0000">The Raging Queen of 
Beers</font>, #855, +0.69)</p>

<p>“...he was a little disappointed in the lack of rain, to feed the shiggy pits, we thought to ourselves, 
‘excuses already; this run would certainly be in the shits.’” (<font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>, 
#846)</p>

<p>“Anyways, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> would never lie or exaggerate.  So this account is guaranteed to 
be completely accurate.” [Obvious cynicism]  “Ratings were of course outstanding: even with no bimbos, the group 
was effusive. “Well done, indeed!” said <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>.  “Bravo!” said <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>... At least this is how <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> described it to me.” [So 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> authored this write-up?  Further investigation is warranted.]  (<font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, #840)</p>

<p>“A good time had by all, and the hash was as good as any I have set!!” [It was April Fool’s Day, so it’s obvious 
this hash totally sucked.]  (<font color="#FF0000">MrsEnemaBill</font> aka <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>, #831)</p>

<p>“On on, on on through these tick infested, pricker infested woods, tree branches cracked, <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
Who</font> falling only to be caught by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> - <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was 
smiling especially bright after "catching" <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> in the rear!” (<font 
color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font>, #824, -6.9)</p>

<p>“The night seemed to be a wash, the crying, the whining all the way to the onon...” (<font color="#FF0000">Ever 
Ready</font>, #811)</p>

<p>“The perfect hash became the flashpoint for the RIH3 transition into the RI Search and Rescue squad... A watershed 
day for the RIH3, the first time a hasher had become completely lost, and couldn’t be found anywhere near the 
trail... [RIH3 is] now responsible for a $3,146 bill for Search and Rescue services.” (<font 
color="#FF0000">PW</font>, #802)</p>

<p>“If only the RIH3 knew beforehand what a shitty run this was going to be...” (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, 
#795, 6.9)</p>

<p>“...Yours truly ventured off onto the trail ...and in exasperation off trail and discovered what potential this 
run could have had: more shiggy, briars, briars and did I say briars?” (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, 
#786)</p>

<p>“The hare knew this and so expected a small turn out and so he bribed various family members with a free 
colonoscopy if they came to the run...” [It seems professionalism is, in fact, allowed in hashing.  Pathetic, 
but I digress.] (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, 778)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>After a perplexed reading of the above excerpts, the Scribe cannot possibly know what to expect from this mad 
<font color="#FF0000">Doctor WHO</font> prowls into and up anal cavities (homage to shiggy and a love for haggis, 
no doubt).  And given the factual statements offered above (which would be bullet-proof testimony in any court of 
law), the Scribe wonders if he should hash ever again.  But the good (sane) Scribe digresses.</i></p>

<p><i>Given that the Scribe could only find one, <i>ONE</i>, <b>ONE</b> negative rating for all Dr. WHO’s runs, the 
Scribe has concluded that RIH3 has been hijacked by some satanic cult lead by this maniac called <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>.  And the other hashers are locked into a form of Stockholm syndrome, even the 
renowned psychiatrist <font color="#FF0000">Dr. Oozing</font>, as they rave and worship this <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>.  Therefore, the Scribe has no option but to preemptively rate <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO's</font> up-cuming hash to be a <b>–69,000.69</b> just to restore meaning to this pathetic 
group of wankers that calls itself RIH3.</i></p>
