color=#000000>For the Thanksgiving holiday, a special Sunday hash was arranged. 
This is primarily because it almost guarantees that <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> won’t show up. Everyone needs a reason to be 
thankful, now and then. The hare arranged a start in Harrisville at a little 
park just north of Harrisville Pond. Not exactly virgin territory, but at least 
not in a league with the Burrillville Middle School. The hare specified that all 
would need to stop for a photo-op.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail started off promptly at 2 PM. They went west, under a fence 
and across some playing fields. They came to a familiar field house, where the 
hare made them stop and line up under the “Eccleston” sign on the building. He 
wanted to recreate a photo from the early days of hashing when he had dark hair 
and wore Richard Simmons style short-shorts. 
Pathetic.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>From this point, the hash actually started. Trail led west on the 
road. A check sent <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Swampy</FONT> into a 
neighboring field. <FONT color=#ff0000>Cumsocket To Me</FONT> moved to join 
them. But before they had time to get friendly, <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> 
found true trail, south on River St. East on Chapel, then south on Foster. All 
this fine shiggy, and the hash was on the pavement? A car pulled over and asked 
if this was the hash. What do we look like, runners?!! It was a hasher visiting 
from DC. His name was unknown until the circle, and he drove off to find the 
start. He was provisionally referred to as <FONT color=#ff0000>Secret Asian 
Man</FONT>. Back on trail, they finally entered the 
woods.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The trail ignored a gas pipeline, and continued south,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>mostly bushwhacking. They came to a 
water crossing at a Duck Pond. Only <FONT color=#ff0000>CEP</FONT> crossed, 
chest high. The rest circled the pond to the right and found marks. However, the 
orientation was such that they all got confused as to which way was out or in. 
Kinda like the story of <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo’s</FONT> marriage. They 
finally made it out to some powerlines and turned 
east.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The powerlines came out to Mowry St. A brief jog south and it was 
back on some other powerlines to the hare and the beer check. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> easily found the beer. But there were only four cups. 
The hare made wild accusations. The hare made lame excuses.The hare’s a WANK! 
Cups were shared as stragglers came in. But no <FONT color=#ff0000>Secret Asian 
Man</FONT>. He ran into the late cummers <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Short Shorts</FONT>. 
Better company than at the beer check (excluding, of course, <FONT

Me</FONT>.)<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail back continued on the powerlines east to Rt. 98. It then 
turned north to Harrisville Center, and a series of annoying side loops through 
library parking lots, down to the Clear River, etc. Eventually they made it back 
to the cars. A brief wait for <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Secret Asian Man</FONT> was rewarded, and they convoyed back to 
Snake Hill Road, and the circle.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The holiday spirit colored the ratings. Avoidable shiggy, too much 
pavement, annoying atempts to recapture the hare’s youth, and no drinking 
vessels at the BC were powerful. But no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, no 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> and no <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> were 
not without merit. Total: +0.69. Backsliders were punished (<FONT 
color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Cumsocket To Me</FONT>), 
non-runners were ridiculed (<FONT color=#ff0000>JIMA</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Dogmeat</FONT>), and the visitor was interrogated. Hashit went to 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> for leading the visitor astray. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Rusty</FONT> lost his drinking vesel, more than once, thanks to 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> had a Santa 
Look-alike contest with a dummy.&nbsp;No one won, because they broke the dummy. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> took more pictures, to photoshop in later. And 
then a fine Thanksgiving meal was had by all. But <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT> still a WANK!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
