<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>An invasion into the territory of the (temporarily?) defunct Newport Bowling Hash was arranged by the hare for this 
Monday. Naturally, as the hashers arrived, a bowling ball was produced and was used as a parking lot missile to try and 
crack the axle of the Bondo-mobile. But the RIH3 has yet to produce a competent bowler. So <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> made it into the lot unscathed. No prelube being offered, they were off promptly at 6:30, with only <font 
color="#FF0000">Sparky</font>and <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font> present to misrepresent Newport hashing.</p>

<p>From the back of the parking lot, trail led west through an abandoned Ball field to 114. They crossed and headed down 
into a construction area. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, as usual, wandered 
off each in his own direction. The rest were led by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> circling south. <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> turned left at a check (wrong), and <font color="#FF0000">Just Travis</font> found true trail right (right), 
northwest on a small powerline. He led out to an old monastery or abandoned church or something. <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> caught up, and with <font color="#FF0000">Just Travis</font> were briefly 
confused. They finally re-oriented (sexually?) and continued northwest on trail. A hole in a fence was found (they 
re-oriented, again) and trail was followed through a very brief, very light patch of shiggy out onto Defense Highway. True 
trail was found by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, northeast on the road.</p>

<p>They found a check opposite the Navy Recreation Area from whence <font color="#FF0000">EB RIPTA</font> had set a few 
winters ago. And <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knew whence to go from here! He turned east to find the beer a short 
distance in the woods off an abandoned road. Naturally, he turned back calling false trail. Most did not stray far, not 
trusting the bad Doctor. At least <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> wandered off onto Federal property where he broke 
local laws, federal laws and the laws of nature. The hare arrived, and with <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> took the beer 
out of sight from the road. Unfortunately, even Basket cannot be fooled forever. Other stragglers included <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, flummoxed by the necessity of getting his pole through the hole in the fence, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> with <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font>, who had other things on their minds. Very small 
things, it might be guessed. At any rate, the BC had just enough beer to encourage a moderately long Rhubarb song.</p>

<p>Beer mostly gone, they resumed. Trail led southeast on the progressively more overgrown road. A check sent <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>/and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> right, while <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> turned left into woods. The true trail was in between. But <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> managed to pick up the trail as it curved slightly north, and followed it to a barbed wire fence. Flour led up the 
trunk of a tree that had fallen across the fence. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would be stupid enough to actually 
cross at this point? <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, that’s <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font>! <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led the rest around the fence, and the group rejoined in the elm-lined 
driveway of an apartment complex. They met late arrival <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>. Trail led west up to 114, 
and was followed with little difficulty south to Union St, and then right on Jepson to the School.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> heard the commotion of their arrival and returned from the ball fields. They 
prepared to circle. Only to find that the hare’s beer was gone! Stolen! Lost! Hashit! The distraught hare drove back to 
the BC to get what was left, and to make a quick stop to get some warm IPA for the circle. Finally, they circled and rated 
the run. Ratings: pavement, stolen beer, no shiggy, vs virgin territory, large turn out. Total: <b>0</b>. Hashit was 
charitably and inexplicably given to <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> for being 
Newporters. The On On On was held at the Coddington Brewery. Good beer, and OK food was had, under the disapproving eyes 
of a humorless young waitress, and her management staff. But even a few songs, some birthday greetings for another table, 
and an “Alouette” (all after the food was delivered, of course) could not get the group thrown out without paying. So it 
was an expensive evening, altogether. Especially for the hare.</p>
