<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Hung-over from the night before, in unfamiliar wilderness territory, contending with heat, insects, flour shortages, 
and what he thought was poison-ivy, the hare came through with minutes to spare and set a trail. Well, coming through 
might be a bit of an exaggeration. But at least there was a hash. Not on a Monday. Not in Rhode Island. Oh just face it! 
Everyone knew this was going to suck! But an excuse to have beer was needed. (<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> never 
needs an excuse, so he made a last minute decision to skip the run. He has never shown such good sense. All are 
worried.) They gave the hare ten minutes to drive ahead and "finish" his trail. They drove off, hardly filling <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> van. They soon picked up the hare marking Quincy Road about 25 yards away from his van. 
Great! He climbed aboard. They stopped at <font color="#FF0000">The Fat One's</font> house to try to recruit him. He 
also was too wise. So finally the few remaining diehards were led like lambs to the slaughter, to the starting point at 
a tree farm east of Stinson Lake Road.</p>

<p>They entered a meadow together heading east. No marks were seen. The overgrown grasses, bittersweet and stinging 
nettles hid the flour well. The hare had decided not to try to mark any trees or rocks that might actually allow his 
trail to be seen. He got them started. Trail led slightly north of east and uphill. The few marks followed old logging 
roads that were so overgrown that no one even tried to pretend to be running. And the woods alongside were impassable. 
The progress was slow. The mosquitoes had it easy. Some light shiggy was encountered in the form of spring-water and 
rainwater run-offs crossing the trails. But mostly it was knee-deep grasses that they had to wade through, and old brush 
piles that they had to pick their way over.</p>

<p>After a few checks it became clear that the hare was trying to climb to the top of the southern ridge of Stinson 
Mountain. Most of the checks could be solved simply by taking the uphill route. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 
having some familiarity with the area, left the main pack and paralleled the ridge line. He was soon off trail.  He was 
soon lost. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> followed him briefly, but was soon drawn back by the whistles of <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> in the lead. They turned southeast. They crossed 
several more substantial left-over limb piles from the lumbering operations and finally reached the top of the ridge on 
a falsie. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> rejoined them. He was soon lost again.</p>

<p>After a brief bushwhack, the trail turned south and downhill. It was now a much better developed trail, with less 
brush. It was well-shaded. The mosquitoes were happy for the break from the hot sun. The hashers finally were together, 
more or less, loping down the ridge. They were running. They were whistling and yelling. They might have been actually 
mistaken for hashers for the first time. The trail was straight and check-free. They finally came out at a (different) 
tree farm. The hare gave strict instructions to follow the trail quickly and quietly on the north side of a stone wall. 
He hadn't wanted to bother with getting permission for crossing someone's yard. He's obviously become hardened since his 
last trail in Woonsocket.</p>

<p>The group emerged, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> leading the way onto 
Quincy Road. An arrow pointed east. But the hare's truck was west. The hare's truck contained beer. Q.E.D. About ¾ mile 
of pavement west and they were at the hare's truck. They were greeted by <font color="#FF0000">The Fat One</font>! 
Brilliant! The hare arrived and unlocked. They took the cooler around behind one of the many large boulders and had 
their beer check. Finally, some enjoyment from this run. They had some beer. They sang some songs. They swatted some 
mosquitoes. And with great joy they learned that they would be driven back to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> to 
finish the run. The hare drove <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> back to the start to collect his car. <font 
color="#FF0000">The Fat One</font> drove the pack back to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> to collect some more 
beer.</p>

<p>The circle was joined in Loon Lake, next to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> dock. Ratings for the run:  
Impromptu trail, virgin territory, nettles and mosquitoes, and no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had to compete 
with limited shiggy, too little elevation gain, and too long a trail from BC to Circle. Total: +6.9. Hashit to <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for getting persistently off-trail despite hosting and instructing the hare. <font 
color="#FF0000">The Fat One</font> was punished for showing up. Everyone was secretly envious that he and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had not even tried to make the run. The circle would have gone on, but for the fact that 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> neighbors, some with young children, were also out in the water. No one could 
remember any inoffensive songs. And they were hungry. So they packed it in. They swung low and came out for barbeque, 
Beer, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> dynamites, beer, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cheese and bread, and some 
beer. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> entered the canoe with umbrella sails, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
tried to steal various docks from around the lake, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> tried to catch fish in a nearby swamp maple tree. There were no fish in the tree. But there are now several of 
<font color="#FF0000">Short Peck's</font> prize lures in this tree. Then, <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> arrived. 
This disaster ended the hash for sure!</p>
