<p><font color="#008000">Run #1090</font>, February 19, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; West Greenwich, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 10s, clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish, Basket, Oozing, Dr. WHO, Seamus, Bondo, Ben, Eenie Weenie Dick, 
Justin My Ass, Dry Foot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>This run was a different sort of run, a run with a bit of culture perhaps.  I’m sure that we’ve all (ok – most) have 
had some sort of female companionship in the past and that we all (again, maybe most) have had to put up with some 
cultural crap to make the other half happy.  Because in the end we all (well, in this case none) know that if they’re 
happy we’re happy.  You know the cultural crap I’m talking about – ballets, chick flicks, museums, fancy restaurants that 
require pants, and quite possibly those funky ice skating shows.  “Walt Disney on Ice” type stuff.  Which reminds me of a 
funny SNL skit from years ago; they had a commercial for “Walt Disney on Ice” and just had a coffin sliding around in a 
skating rink.  Get it, Walt’s dead!  Hahaha, ok, maybe you had to see it.  Anyway, this hash would end up like one of 
those cultural events with all but two RIH3 members sliding around in the frozen woods often ending up on their ass, which 
is far less graceful than anything Brian Boitano would do.</p>

<p>Hare’s directions had everyone meet up at the Big River Inn off Rt 3 in West Greenwich.  It was a cold night, in the 
teens again after a cold front had pushed through but there was a lack of wind which made the temps seem much better than 
the number suggested.  As people showed up they piled into <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> van, for what reason I’m 
not sure - it certainly couldn’t have been because of the appealing smell.  As 6:30 rolled around the group hopped out, 
and first mark (or mahhhhhk as the hare would say) lead southeast on Congdon Hill Rd.  This mahhhhhk would be the only 
we’d see for some time, I’d guess along the lines of 12miles as we pounded pavement downhill.  Finally, a check was 
encountered and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led the way northeast aided by his seeing eye dog Seamus.  One 
mahhhhk, two mahhhhks, eh good enough.  This had <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Justin My 
Ass</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> and most of the gang following in <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s
</font> footsteps which we all know is the wrong way to go.  Fortunately, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had some sort 
of wits (“w”its guys, keep it clean) and proceeded southwest. This was sooooooo much better (“so” emphasized to imply 
sarcasm).</p>

<p>This is where the trail got good.  And by good, I mean shitty.  One, two, fifteen mahhhhhks passed as we proceeded to 
walk through the woods, mainly because the snow/slush from last week had frozen solid and provided a nice base for some 
slipping and sliding (this is not to be confused with the “slippery slidy” that <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> makes 
reference to on a regular basis).  The hare managed to find a few hunter’s trails to follow, and this provided a basis for 
<font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> to perform not one, but two salchow jumps*.  Although impressive, these would 
only net him a 6.2/10 on scoring.  What was really weird about this section was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> 
ability to forge ahead at the front of the pack.  This is most likely due to the fact that everyone was walking, and 
walking is a skill that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> excels at.  You know, like riding his bike.</p>

<p>After a bunch of mahhhhks, some additional slips and slides and a few icy tree banches to the face we came to check #2, 
lonely check #2.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> blazed the way left, followed foolishly by <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dryfoot</font>.  Not sure if anyone had gone 
right.  And <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>?  Still in the rear after lagging back near Condgdon Hill Rd.  After 
heading up trail a good bit and <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> performing a lovely Walley jump** (this time 
improving his score to a 7.6/10) all noticed the hare was not with them and returned to the check to find the rest had 
continued the other way.</p>

<p>It was at this point the hash became a walk in the woods.  Literally.  With no paths left to follow, the hare went 
where no man had gone before, or least no sane man.  The trail continued in a southward direction with mahhhhhks often 
enough to allow the RIH3 to no get lost.  There were a few stone wall crossings.  There were a few large rock crossings.  
There were a few fallen tree crossing.  There were a few small brush bushwacking sessions.  You get the picture.  We 
finally ended up on a “real” trail, where the third and final check was located.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went 
right, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> went straight uphill and someone else went left.  After hearing <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> call on-on <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> came back downhill (sliding part of the way) 
to find out that he was full of shit.  Again.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> lead toward the left with <font 
color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> not 
far behind.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> was in there somewhere in addition to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  This nice “real” trail was smooth and level, perfect for creation of an 
ice skating rink.  Upon hearing <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> perform a flip jump***, <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> turned around just long enough to loose his balance and perform a delayed axel****.  Although not in synch or 
planned to be performed as a pair, I’m sure both jumps combined would be good for a 9+/10 score.  Awesome!</p>

<p>After flailing around in the woods for some time, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> managed to pull some smarts out 
of his ass and returned back toward the direction we had come from at the check, finding a side trail leading back towards 
Congdon Hill Rd.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> managed to take a fall at the check, in addition to <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, so everyone was feeling pretty ready for this hash to be over.</p>

<p>Once on Congdon Hill Rd, an arrow left had them heading back towards the car and past a large field filled with cows.  
Their large, beady eyes glowing in the dark made them appear just as tasty as they look in the light.  Get in my belly!!
</p>

<p>After rounding a bend the hare ducked into the woods and the beer check was found.  Worn down from lots of pavement, 
warm beer (with the weather in the teens, how does he do it!?) and chocolate truffles for snacks makes for a short beer 
check.  I do believe there was no singing.</p>

<p>Another left onto Congdon Hill Rd had us eventually circled up at the cars to the side of the Big River Inn.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> thought the trail was brilliant.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> agreed on the “alternative” nature to a bunch of dudes walking in the woods.  I think <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> yapped about soccer, somehow.  Mathematical total: <b>+ 0.69!</b>  Amazing!  Hashit was with <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and ended up staying with Basket as he managed to confess he’d taken over <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot’s</font> hare duty for next week.  Such a pushover that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> is.
</p>

<p>Poor <font color="#FF0000">Jen</font> at the Big River Inn had to put up with our crap for yet another Monday night, 
and unsurprisingly passed on being set up with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  All in all, a pretty decent night, 
despite all that ice skating cultural crap.</p>

<p>*The salchow jump (pronounced "sal-kow"), named for its originator Ulrich Salchow, is an edge jump. It takes off from a 
back inside edge and lands on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. Salchows are most often preceded by a forward 
outside 3 turn, but a mohawk entrance is not unusual.<br><br>

**Walley jump, a full-rotation edge jump with a counter-rotated entry from a back inside edge to the back outside edge of 
the same foot.<br><br>

***The flip jump is a toe jump that takes off from a back inside edge and lands on the back outside edge of the opposite 
foot. A flip is usually preceded by a forward outside 3 turn or forward inside mohawk.<br><br>

****Delayed Axel, an Axel jump in which the skater delays the rotation in the air.</p>
