<p><font face="Arial">For those of us who have seen it before, they might say,
&quot;No, it’s an impossibility.&quot; Strange but true. <font color="#CC0000">Bondo</font>
set the run of his life in this A.S.Gispert Memorial Hash, and even if the theme
might be disputed by <font color="#CC0000">PW</font>, it was non-the-less a
very, very memorable hash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We started from Sears’s parking lot in the Woonsocket,
Walnut Hill Plaza. Just behind the plaza is the little traveled New England Golf
Course trail last set by Iron Man over 8 years ago. After tonight’s hash, I
wonder how short it will be before we’re here again? Time will tell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#CC0000">Oozing, Shine On, WIPOS, Turtle Dust</font>
(yep! The Turtle was back…if even for a cameo), and <font color="#CC0000">Basket
</font>joined the Hare Bondo with his only friends Jake and Ben. It was bloody
cold, even for the Ice Box of Rhode Island, and with the wind whipping at over
20 mph, it felt like negative numbers numbing bone and boner. <font color="#CC0000">Shine
On</font> looking for her Y2K fuck, had a close eye on Jake and Ben, whose fur
coat gave enough warmth allowed to have wood still standing. The hare set trail
using paper, and shredded red paper at that, in honor of our fallen founding
hash master.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The trail led behind the building and along a fence, until
the opening under the fence was high enough for us to crawl under. It should
also be noted that it was at a particular stream crossing where one had to tread
lightly with the snow, ice, and rushing water, lest on fell into the freezing
brine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The pack was stretching out at this time, and <font color="#CC0000">Oozing</font>
and I found the first major check of the hash. I checked left and didn’t see
the pack for another 2 miles of foot plus snow trekking. <font color="#CC0000">Oozing</font>
led the merry pack on trail. I could hear <font color="#CC0000">Oozing’s</font>
Doo-wop whistle off in the distance and an occasional blast from <font color="#CC0000">Bondo’s</font>
Conch Shell, as I paralleled them through fairways, roughs, greens, sand hazards
deep with snow, and plenty of briar laden woods. Finally from nowhere came the
pack in my direction. <font color="#CC0000">Oozing</font> first then the
laggards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I was FRB and justified my bushwhacking ability to sniff
out trail. The trail continued along my fairway, as I knew it would. <font color="#CC0000">Bondo</font>
just had to have his shortcut, as he never runs full length of the trail, and I
found it. Just as quickly as the pack joined me, that a new check had them
running into the woods. I pursued looking for trail downhill along the fairway,
knowing full well <font color="#CC0000">Bondo</font> would bring them back to
me. As <font color="#CC0000">Bondo’s</font> honking and <font color="#CC0000">Oozing’s
</font>whooping faded in the distance, I ran farther and farther off trail, down
deeper into the very bowels of the Woonsocket/Massachusetts line. I finally
stopped at briars well over my head, and nothing but the same for as far as I
could see. Having not heard a peep from the pack for what seem like hours, I bit
the bullet and ran back uphill. Back through the briars, through the snowdrifts,
through fields and fairways and fucking snow up my ass, and all uphill.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I finally found the footprints in snow going into the
woods and followed them, continuing uphill terminally. I eventually caught the
pack as it traveled out to a small street, crossing Diamond Hill and through a
little sleepy bedroom community notched into the back hills on Woonsocket. It
was another 20 minutes before beer was discovered at <font color="#CC0000">Face
Douche</font>’s house hidden behind some cars, but the Face wasn’t there to
offer us a warm respite from the cold wind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Beer in hand we started out towards our cars, still a mile
or more to finish this Ball Busting, Shit Ass Long Fucking Trail. <font color="#CC0000">Bondo</font>
had one more trick up his sleeve, as he let the FRB’s travel past this
ill-marked trail behind Wal-Mart. <font color="#CC0000">Oozing,</font> <font color="#CC0000">WIPOS</font>
and I caught up with the bastard just as he found safe footing on the cleared
lot, and we all made our way out to the cars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We circled up at <font color="#CC0000">Bondo’s</font>
garage, and Down-downs were given the Hare for his only really long fucking
hash, <font color="#CC0000">WIPOS</font> for Hashit (again), and <font color="#CC0000">Shine
On </font>for not getting the best fare to Betty Ford’s Rehab Hash next month.
We then joined <font color="#CC0000">Just Big Shit </font>or should I say, <font color="#CC0000">Princess
Blows Wind in the Pines</font>, upstairs for more <font color="#CC0000">Bondo </font>brew
and hot chilly. Kudos’ to <font color="#CC0000">Bondo</font> for trail, beer,
and chilly, and we finally made our way home with bellies full and smiles wide,
with the knowledge the &quot;G&quot; would have loved this one.</font></p>
