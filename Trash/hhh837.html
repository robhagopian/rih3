<p><font color="#0000ff">The Run</font>:</p>
<p>Dimly-seen memories have been haunting the mind of your scribe, elusively just out of reach of his conscious&nbsp; 
(semi-) mind. Much like the troubling nightmares that have caused him to wake unexpectedly in a cold sweat most nights 
over the last two years, these troubling memories are of a hash. A pathetic excuse for a hash. An abortion of a hash. 
Putting the pieces of the puzzle together based upon extensive researches into the climate charts, tide tables and 
Farmer's Almanac (as well as looking at the gaps in the HashTrash), he has determined that this hash took place back on 
May 13th. Your scribe realizes that he will know no peace until he relives and acknowledges this event despite the pain 
it will cause him. Thus, after using an ancient Native-American ritual involving considerable quantities of psychotropic 
substances (based mainly upon the common hop and barley) to invoke a return of these awful memories, your scribe provides 
the truncated but still sad and dismal commentary that follows.<br><br>

Gathering at the fishing area at the Slatersville Reservoirs on 102, were the few, the proud, and the imbecilic. The 
hashers who could not let a torrential rain go past without a run. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Dr WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> arrived and parked waiting in vain for others to join them, but unfortunately all the rest 
were too canny to show up for what had been billed as a virgin run in the Glendale area (not bloody likely). <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, the hare pulled in, splashing mud over everyone. He stated that it was not to be the 
expected A to B, but a circular run with interesting features, fine beers, and lovely weather. One out of three is not 
bad for a hare in the RIH3.<br><br>

The group headed off at the hare's insistence, crossing the road and moving northwest uphill. A few checks were easily 
dispatched and the powerlines were encountered. Knowing the effect of electromagnetic radiation upon the steel plates in 
the hare's skull, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> both abandoned efforts to 
find the traces of flour in the many puddles, and simply turned north on the powerlines.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> was still struggling up the hill, tempted by the proximity of Wright's Chicken Farm. His loyal companions Jake 
and Ben soon abandoned him for adventures with <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>, respectively.<br><br>

The powerline turned just north of west at an impressively humming junction box, whose emissions of power doubtless set 
off powerful reactions in the cerebral-cortical pleasure centers of the hare, as there was considerable flour scattered 
around its base. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>lengthened his stride and continued downhill to Inman Road. This was 
crossed and the powerlines were abandoned. Trail led to a large gate, locked and bolted. A sign on the gate read:</p>

<p align="center"><br><b><font color="#0000FF">PRIVATE PROPERTY</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">NO TRESPASSING</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#0000FF">THIS MEANS YOU, BASKET! </font></b></p>

<p><br>Beneath these letters, in a childish scrawl in red crayon someone had written: &quot;Up Yurs! B3&quot;. Naturally, 
the gate was jumped and trail found, heading downhill west into some meadows.<br><br>

To the south there lay woods. To the north, a veritable forest. But trail led west along a gentle downhill slope through 
open fields. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> moved further ahead as the ever solicitous <font color="#FF0000">Dr. 
WHO</font> waited for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to crest the rise and join the trespassers on trail. Down the 
slope they ran, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and Ben disappearing into the mists, <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font> and Jake following more sedately and Bondo still wrestling with the temptations of Wright's Farm. At the 
bottom of the hill they crossed a small brook and went back uphill through more pastures until a check turned left into 
the grounds of St Teresa's Shrine.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> being a godless heathen, moved right on through and found true trail leading to 
the beer check, where he, Ben and the hare met, consumed beer and doubtless indulged in a bizarre sort of ménage-a-trois. 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> faithfully followed the flour into the Stations of the Cross. He walked the Stations 
slowly when all of a sudden he was struck by a rapture, a vision, an overwhelming religious ecstasy that left him weak 
and breathless. All truth was revealed to him in one moment. All questions were answered. [Note: he cannot disclose all 
that was revealed to him for obvious reasons. But among other things, he suddenly foresaw a future run using the same 
territory (in two weeks time!). He learned the secrets of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS's</font> hash armor, of <font 
color="#FF0000">Async's</font> resistance to poison ivy, of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> colonic immunity. He 
suddenly realized the true origin of Basket as the result of a secret postwar genetic experiment by the last remnants of 
the Nazi Party upon kidnapped members of the Vienna Boys Choir. But I digress.] Former GM Jake, seeing <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO's</font> hapless condition, took charge. He dragged the dazed hasher through a junkyard and a 
surprised property owner's croquet lawn, back to Rt 102 and east back to the start and the cars.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo,</font> sated after two breasts, a thigh and a drumstick, had already made it back and was 
driving out to rescue his dogs from the clutches of the evil hare. He provided some beer for <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font>, who drank standing comfortably in the reservoir, enjoying the rain, while <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
set out. After a while <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>burst from the underbrush with tales of a wonderful beer-check 
obviously fabricated in an effort to curry favor with the hare and avoid the hashit. Finally <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, 
</font>Ben and the hare arrived and the group arranged to meet at the hare's home to circle and dine. The mists of your 
scribe's memory do not reveal much of these proceedings except that the long-suffering <font color="#FF0000">Dog 
Meat</font> attempted to join the circle from behind closed doors, and nearly was proclaimed hashit for the same. The run 
was rated 0.69, positive scores only because of the weather and the 69% hashers-lost-on-trail rate.&nbsp; Hashit? <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, of course. Why? Who cares? Food? Fine fare, enjoyed by all, even <font color="#FF0000">Dr. 
WHO</font> (who had been given permission to run this evening by she-who-must-be-obeyed only on condition that he make it 
back for supper after the run. But <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> is no stranger to two suppers in one evening, I 
can tell you.).</p>

<p>Now, if you REALLY want to know what happened on this run, simply read the write-up for Run #839 backwards, starting 
in the middle, and deleting all references to Boston hashers.</p>
