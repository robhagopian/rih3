<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">4/13/08: Another summary. Another counterclockwise 
(semi-)loop. And I’m getting closer to when I might remember something about 
these hashes. But why are they SO unmemorable? (I can’t even remember my own 
trail from February. And it was brilliant!) Pathetic! The hare suffers from a 
lack of imagination, much like his roommate. But at least he sets a trail when 
it’s his turn. Starting from Box Seats in Smithfield doesn’t exactly bode well 
for virgin territory. Whatever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Trail started out west to the path along the reservoir. A 
check was easily mastered, and the pack turned south, to another check near the 
dam/spillway.<font color="#FF0000"> Amish </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
checked the spillway, figuring on at least a little shiggy. Wrong. Trail went 
out to pavement and turned left on the path on the south side of the 
Woonasquatucket River. Never been there before! A check at the 116 bridge sent 
hashers in all directions, But <font color="#FF0000">Concrete </font>found it 
first, up the embankment, and then across the river on the bridge to the north 
bank of the river.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The entire network of trails leading to Bryant through 
Washington Grove Park now lay at the hare’s disposal. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> ventured forth, not to be heard from for some time. But
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> found 
true trail, bushwhacking along the riverbank heading east. And it wasn’t long 
before they came to the Beer Check. Not long. Meaning maybe a mile. But that’s 
not all bad. And <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was missing. The beer check 
was next to a few non-descript trees on a steep slope next to the river. They 
started in on the beer and were about to sing, when they saw a light and a 
bewildered <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>looking for marks at the top of 
the ridge on the strangely-named Appian Way. (The Smithfield Industrial Park 
obviously has delusions of grandeur, comparing this ¼ mile path with the “Queen 
of Roads” stretching from the Forum Romana to Brundisium on the heel of the 
Italian boot. But I digress.) They tried to be quiet, but eventually
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>heard the stifled whispers (Mostly they were 
saying things like:”I can’t believe he’s that dumb.” and “Is he deaf as well as 
color-blind?” and things like that.) He joined them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Finishing up the last beers, they were on out. Trail 
continued briefly along the river. It then turned north through the Industrial 
Park on the infamous powerlines. Once they hit 116, no one was looking for any 
marks, and they turned back to Rt 5 and the cars.<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> 
led through the woods of the park. He delayed everyone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;They circled in the woods behind Box Seats. The run was 
rated. Near loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> some good ice shiggy, 
and no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were up against prolonged pavement on 
the way back, no bimbos, and lack of loss of Basket. Total: +0. Hashit went to
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for being the loud voice at the BC that 
resulted in <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> finding said BC. Finishing up, 
they of course crossed the street and had the On On On at Effin’s. Pretty soon, 
the owner at Box Seats is going to have any car with an “On On” foot towed.</p>
