<P>The venue this week was off route 99 behind the Honda dealership, I
would just like to comment that the directions were shit and it is no wonder
we only get a few attendees for our runs, the directions were on 146 under
295 under another non existent bridge (were you pissed when you found it
Basket?), then take a left on an unmarked road. Your scribe who is a persistent
bastard of course took a first left down route 99 totally bloody lost went
back to where I started which took 10 minutes because you silly bastards
put concrete in the middle of the road and we have to go around in f*****
circles to back to where you want to be, no wonder petrol (gas to you uneducated
bastards, which is not a liquid anyway) is so cheap. </P>

<P>Finally finding my way around to the back of the Honda garage to find
Baskets and Beyond Hope’s wheels, the time was 6.40pm and I followed the
marks off down the road on right towards water but no more marks, I thought
it was too early for Basket to run out of flour so I back tracked a number
of times until I heard the ominous noise of the Rhode Island farting bugle
in the distance, if Basket could blow the bloody thing I would have heard
it sooner. I decided to hack my way through the thorns towards the sound
of on-on, realizing by now that the pack was just ahead, but I was getting
more and more into trouble, then a stream which I tried to avoid but realized
I would need to get across to reach the pack, in up to my knees in F*****
freezing water, it was only around 40 degrees F. Finally I found the rest
of the pack which consisted of Hopeless and Basket our hare for this week.
</P>

<P>We carried on down a track which I can only say was stumbled through,
Basket told us he had his bike with him, Hopeless and I concluded he only
had this for his arm exercises as there was no way you could ride through
this shit. Plenty of shiggy and a good part of the run was spent ankle
deep in water. A unanimous decision was made that flour half way up the
tree might be a good idea rather than on leaves on a windy night, “Dickhead”.
More fun to be had as we came upon a fence about 8Ft high with ball removers
on the top, Basket obviously having had GI Joe training was over pretty
quick before we were able to get our hands around his neck, Hopeless was
next and managed to get one ball caught on the top, with Basket shouting
“let me hold something for you”-pervert, he finally got over, next I was
up pretty easily and Hopeless was leaning over checking his clutter which
required a torch and magnifying glass, all I can say is I hope Fergie has
got small hands. While he was bent over I stood on his back for extra support
and the silly bastard moved, I quickly had to get my other leg over before
I lost my sack of potatoes, Basket during this near disaster was pissing
himself wishing he had brought a camera which would have been shoved somewhere
definitely needing a flashlight. Over a main road through another fence
and lucky for Basket through a hole in another fence up a hill to a beer
stop. </P>

<P>The only good thing about this run was the beer which we drunk by a
religious building but we didn’t care as beer is our religion so it was
a good stop. Basket screeched a few songs, then it was on back, this part
of the run was familiar as I had driven up and down this poxy road looking
for the start point. On home pretty straight forward with Basket trying
to be clever going through water, but Hopeless and I found a far drier
route a few yards away. Circle up, ratings for the run-non ratable which
means Basket you need to set another three to make up for it! Hashshit
awarded to the person who most deserves it-Basket. Then off for grub at
a local greasy Joe’s, at the car park Hopeless rightly pointed out we had
forgotten swing low, a second Hashshit award to Basket. This was promptly
sung in the car park then on in for a cholesterol buster, the Rhode Island
Hash lives on. </P>

<P>Also attached is the City H3 and West London schedules up until February’97
should any of you be in the area, your scribe plus one other a David Lowrie
( a previous visitor to RIH3) turned up in Rhode Island attire to represent
you well in London a mere two weeks ago, we came in the top six of a total
of twenty runners after a long street Hash around and in the grounds of
Alexandria Palace, the Down Down was well managed and nobody fortunately
asked me the origin of my handle, the Down Down was one pint of good old
English ale which was gone in a flash, and as I was putting my glass down
(whilst others were still drinking) it slipped and smashed over the steps
of the pub, they all thought that Snot might have Russian connotations,
but you could say your scribe made his mark in the London Hash. </P>

<P>On-On Snot</P>
