The 69th anniversary of the &quot;We Want Beer!&quot; Parade: May 14, 1932, in
New York City (in protest of Prohibition).<br>
<br>
The pack gathered in the two parking lots opposite the Gilbert Stuart Museum in
North Kingston, evenly split between those that could see the giant HHH on the
ground in front of the 1st lot, and those who required the services of
seeing-eye dogs, and ended up in the next lot. When all had been gathered, it
became clear that an unusual number of virgins had been co-opted, probably by
the judicious use of little-know Asiatic hypnotic techniques by <font color="#FF0000"> Dr W.H.O.</font> At any
rate, <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo, Oozing, Dr. WHO</font>, and hares <font color="#FF0000"> Tinker</font> and
<font color="#FF0000"> Short-shorts</font> all welcomed <font color="#FF0000">
Just Boomer, Just Donna, Just Rob</font> and <font color="#FF0000"> Just Evelyn</font> (or Fred, Ethel, Ricky and
Lucy), to the pack, and promised a lovely and gentle excursion as an
introduction to the refined world of RIH3 hashing. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, from his hospital bed,
had obviously advised the virgins how to dress, as all were wearing winter
running garb and not one of them had an inch of unprotected skin. <font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> arrived
bearing the new hashit bungeed to his posterior, unfortunately not concealing his iridescent mauve flowered running shorts. Instructions from
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, given slowly, using no words over two syllables, cleared up any
questions the virgins had, but had <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000"> Dr. WHO</font> so confused that it
appeared for a while that they might not be able to find the start at all. <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker </font> promised that he had permission from all the property owners for the pack
to traverse their lands. He promised no briars. He promised no shiggy. Finally
he told of the legendary &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dead Head&quot; checks,
checks which were to soon be found to have no discernable significance
whatsoever. The pack was told to follow <font color="#FF0000"> Short-shorts</font> to the start, so
<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> ran on ahead, heedless, into the woods.<br>
<br>
After some initial chaos, the trail was found, adjacent to the Gilbert Stuart
House, crossing a bridge to the west bank of the Pettasquamscutt River, heading
north towards Carr Pond. A sign reading &quot;Check for Ticks&quot; led to a
fruitless search for the little critters in the dirt. It was decided that, being
small insects with little brains (much like the pack itself), the ticks would
probably choose the false trail anyways. Turning west into briars, skirting the
pond, everyone kept together for a while. <font color="#FF0000"> Altered E.D</font>. joined and soon passed
many of the crowd, bringing with him yet another virgin, <font color="#FF0000"> Just
Nicole</font>. Soon back
on a dirt road, they entered the grounds of a girls summer camp: Camp Nowanalei.
This proved disappointing to many of the group, so they stayed on trail, back to
Gilbert Stuart Road. Here they split into three: one group heading NW up Hammond
Hill, another back towards the cars, and the third hanging around <font color="#FF0000">Short-shorts</font>,
who had showed a tendency to stop by the correct trail when everyone was really screwing up.<br>
<br>
True trail was south, up a driveway, and soon turned east to the Pettasquamscutt
River. A flour shortage was encountered. Correctly deducing that this was an A
to B trail (from the fact that Tinker had borrowed <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo's</font> van at the start),
the group followed the river south. Amidst the general confusion, a terrified
property owner encountered a large number of the pack, and developed acute chest
pain, and shortness of breath. Apparently, <font color="#FF0000"> Tinker </font> had obtained permission from
her husband to run the trail across their land; but with a sense of humor worthy
of a hasher, he had not informed his wife and had run off to the Oak Hill Tavern
to quaff some suds with the boys. She was resuscitated and reassured, and went
off to put some poison ivy in her husband's boxer shorts. A group of heavyweight
rowers from URI were encountered, carrying the 2000lb coach's launch. When they
saw the group approaching, they stopped in mid trail, like deer in the
headlights, forcing the hashers to run around, over and under them, in order to stay on trail. They did offer to
&quot;stroke&quot; for some of the harriettes.<br>
<br>
An arrow was found, leading to a check mark near the river. Using the new system
devised by <font color="#FF0000"> Tinker</font> specifically for this hash, this meant that the preceding
arrow was to be ignored, and the true trail led in the opposite direction. Now
going west into a field, a maypole was found with the mystical
&quot;dragon&quot; check at its base. Cottoning on to <font color="#FF0000"> Tinker's</font> ways, the check
was ignored, and the group headed straight on into the woods, although <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font>
hung back at first, to stroke the pole, and Ben attempted to mount the dragon.
In the woods, it was not long before the &quot;Dead Head&quot; check was found,
near the only shiggy on the trail. This was a muddy stream running down the
trail. Unfortunately, most decided to bypass the mud, which was all too easy,
and didn't even require any blood loss.<br>
<br>
The beer check was found, much of the beer ingeniously hidden in <font color="#FF0000"> P.W.'s</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">
Cheap Licker's </font> respective stomachs. They had arrived separately, using another
style of hashing, previously unknown to your inexperienced scribe. This
apparently involves short-cutting on the basis of insider information, to the
beer stop where the goal is to consume as much of the beer as possible without
any physical exertion whatsoever, before <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> arrives, so that he will be left
short. The plan worked well. While the FRB's had Harpoon with the SCB's, <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font>
was given a Budweiser, found on trail and possibly the cause of death for the
Dead Head found at the nearby check. He shared, as is his wont, by giving a
communal beer shampoo. A few Renaissance tunes were harmonized, then off to the
endpoint, a few hundred yards away, on Tower Hill Road. The dogs and virgins and
<font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> were driven back to the cars, while the masochism crowd ran the two miles
back to the circle.<br>
<br>
The circle was joined. The hare received unusually charitable scores, in keeping
with the good behaviour theme of the evening. The good weather, the lack of
shiggy, the lack of BEER!, and the lack of major blood loss all were counted
against him. On the positive side, <font color="#FF0000"> Shine On</font> was missing, the mosquitoes were
biting, and the nation's flour stockpile remained full. Total score: +6.9.
Virgins in the circle answered <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing's</font> questions with appropriate confusion,
although when <font color="#FF0000"> Just Rob</font> found out that<font color="#FF0000"> Dr. WHO</font> had made
<font color="#FF0000"> Just Evelyn</font> cum, he
required a tranquilizer dart from <font color="#FF0000"> Basket's</font> Blowgun.
<font color="#FF0000"> Just Donna </font> said: &quot;I
thought you guys just went into the woods together to drink beer!&quot; <font color="#FF0000"> Just
Boomer </font> quietly drank his beer. <font color="#FF0000"> Just Donna</font> and
<font color="#FF0000"> Just Evelyn </font> did their down downs
with water, [ignoring the risks of hyponatremia and water intoxication, as well
as ignoring the fact that water is at least partly (I think) made of hydrogen,
which is highly explosive AND used in the Hydrogen bomb] and <font color="#FF0000"> Just Nicole</font> sang for the virgins: &quot;What do you do with a drunken sailor&quot;. The
virgins were declared hashers.<br>
<br>
All present were at one time or another nominated for the hashit for spurious
reasons, but ultimately it remained with <font color="#FF0000"> Basket,</font> his crime being the simple fact
of his existence. While songs were sung, a van pulled up and a girl got out and
asked if the group had seen two llamas. You could tell from her tone that she
suspected<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> of some sexual perversion with her prized quadrupeds, but
<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font>
was able to successfully convince her that he preferred
&quot;the-love-that-dare-not-bark-its-name&quot;. She left, and the llamas,
showing Tibetan wisdom, did not appear in the circle.<br>
<br>
After &quot;Swinging Low&quot;, the virgins went home to their babysitters, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> wanked off, whining about an early business trip, and the remaining group
went to the On On for some delicious food, and more good behaviour, with only a
sotto voce rendition of &quot;I used to work in Chicago&quot; distinguishing the
group from a church lady tea party. A fine time was had by all, although if the
new hashers show up again, it will probably be to institute legal proceedings
against <font color="#FF0000"> Dr. WHO.</font><br>
