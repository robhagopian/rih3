<p><font color="#008000">Run #1009</font>, August 1, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Branch Ave Stop and Shop, Providence.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 80’s, hazy and humid.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Tinker, Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Bondo, WIPOS, Gives Great Head, Just Nat, 
Oozing, SESYB, Seamus. <font color="#0000FF">Visitors:</font> Polly (Dublin H3), Sparky the Hobosexual (Newport H3).</p>

<p>Providence is not exactly ideal territory for the RIH3. Little mud or poison ivy, fewer briars, and few non-paved areas 
worth the effort. And the pubs charge an arm and a leg. But it is convenient. Especially for the lazy. And, most 
importantly for a prospective (lazy) hare, garbage almost counts as shiggy. So being both local and exceptionally lazy, 
our hare decided to set trail in Providence/North Providence. (At least he avoided the East Side. Hashing with the yuppies 
again would be almost too much.)</p>

<p>The usual crew met at the back of the parking lot of the Stop and Shop on Branch Ave. There were a lot of discarded 
plastic grocery bags, some empty Gatorade bottles and a few condoms. Not too bad. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> showed up. Now that’s too bad! <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> arrived from Dublin, 
via New Hampshire. When will he learn? <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font>, a Newport H3-er and another Providence 
resident, took advantage of the proximity and showed up. But the hare couldn’t attract <font color="#FF0000">Pounder-On-It
</font>, yet another East-Sider. One wonders why?</p>

<p>The hare promised two beer checks. The hare said it was an A to B. The hare warned against his own trail, or at least 
the “Eagle” version at the “Turkey-Eagle” split. Some were trying to convince <font color="#FF0000">Just Nat</font> that 
the “T” and “E” marks referred to “Tough” and “Easy”. Ruin that one, why don’t you, hare! <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> decided to ignore the other warnings of the hare, and set up their bikes to 
ride this one, assuming excessive pavement would be present.</p>

<p>They were off, out of the parking lot, west on Branch Ave. The T-E split was immediately encountered. All decided to be 
turkeys. No surprise, here. Birds of a feather can’t change their spots. Or something like that. They crossed the bridge, 
continuing west on Branch to a large circle jerk around the Charles Street Triangle. The trash was overflowing from the 
public trash cans. A vagrant slept on a bench. The circle-jerk only fooled the FRBs, again proving the wisdom of avoiding 
excessive exertion on the hash.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> used their 
bikes to get lost further off trail than anyone. We should encourage them to bike whenever possible. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> led <font 
color="#FF0000">GGH</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Nat</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> further west on Branch Ave. They came to the powerlines before the 146 entrance ramp. The 
obvious route was taken. They ran north up the dirt path to the first BC at the dam that forms the south shore of Upper 
Canada Pond.</p>

<p>The beer was brought out. The pack straggled in, even <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> making it relatively 
promptly. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> remained lost. <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> took one look at the beer choices. He left to continue ahead. But why? The beer may have 
been generic but there was an almost endless variety of refuse and garbage here. An empty, doorless refrigerator stood 
just off the trail. Some old whitewalls were stacked beneath a tree. Used condoms and empty beer cans were as always 
ubiquitous. Old fishing line with rusted hooks was festooned on every bush. An orange T-shirt stagnated in the water. For 
some reason, this one proved especially fascinating. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> strained his ingenuity to finally 
grab it without getting his toes wet. The shirt was finally retrieved. It was nothing special, but it was charred at the 
neck and sleeves, prompting some Richard Pryor jokes. Naturally, the “Music Man” followed, along with some other 
favorites. They lost track of the time. Unfortunately, this allowed <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> to arrive. The rest left hurriedly.</p>

<p>Trail led north, then east into some neighborhoods for a brief loop. But all could sense that the pond was where the 
trail would lie. After a short jaunt north on Langdon Rd, they in fact did turn back to some paths along the shore. These 
were overgrown, and had some dried mud. [The weather has been killing our trails. We need some rain! But I digress.] 
Naturally there were some old rotting newspapers as well. And <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> found a framed 
woodburning with a nauseating picture of a child and an insipid motto. She had to have it.[This is what a RISD degree gets 
you. A need to create “art” out of discarded crap. I’d like to see her bedroom. Actually, I really would! But I digress, 
again. How do I stop myself from doing this? Maybe I should have a few sessions with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. 
Am I nuts? Wait a minute! I’m digressing yet again! I’m going to stop now. I promise. It’s just that it’s hard, once you 
know where the “bracket” key is. Who can blame me? These write-ups are so dull, anyways. You should all be grateful. 
That’s it. I’m finished. For now.] At any rate, these trails were sure to provide a challenge to anyone dumb enough to 
bring a bike. Ha, ha! Continuing north, a second brief spell on Charlotte St, and they turned back behind a playground and 
west to the second BC, in some smelly swampland at the head of the pond, behind some storage sheds off Mineral Springs 
Ave.</p>

<p>The smells provoked some conversation, as they drank their beer. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> began to provide a 
Botany lesson, describing the natural history and uses of some of the weeds growing amidst the rusting appliances, old 
tires and used condoms. [Another RISD type. I’m beginning to sense a pattern. Or is it just gas from that Philly 
cheese-steak I had the other day at Mark’s. Boy, that was a rough one. Wait! You don’t have to tell me. I’m digressing! 
Help!!] Ah, nature! What would we do without it? But the lesson was cut short yet again. Against all odds, <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> appeared, grimly dragging their bikes trough the 
underbrush. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were tired of this. They waited until 
the bikers had opened their beers. Then, they stole the bikes. They continued on out, on trail.</p>

<p>The trail crossed the dried remnant of stream, heading west. It soon turned south and entered some soft sand pits along 
a powerline parallel to 146. No bike riding here! But surprisingly little garbage! <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> realized that they would have had better revenge had they simply left <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> to manage their own bikes. They were even overtaken by 
<font color="#FF0000">GGH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Nat</font>. But finally the trail emerged onto the 
shoulder of 146 and they were able to shoot ahead on a packed dirt path just inside the guardrail. The rest followed at 
their own pace.</p>

<p>The leaders rode back out to Branch Ave, under 146. They entered the Shopping Plaza as per the hare’s instructions, and 
squeezed through a gate in the back. They came to a bridge over a particularly vile stream with rusted shopping carts, 
mattresses and more tires and condoms. There was even a rusted bike. Beautiful! A chalked sign suggested staying at the 
bridge to wait for the hare. Right! They rode on and entered the parking lot for the RI School for the Deaf. They saw the 
hare’s car. They saw a young couple making whoopee in the grass (and garbage) next to the parking lot. The couple didn’t 
seem to care about or perhaps, hear the hashers. Makes sense, I guess.</p>

<p>The circle was held just adjacent to the parking lot. Ratings included comments on the excessive pavement, the frequent 
reappearances of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, and the lack of shiggy. But 
virgin territory, fine smells, refuse on trail and two beer checks changed the balance. Total: +0.69. Hashit: <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, as always. Why don’t we just skip the formalities, and make it his permanently? The circle 
began to get boisterous, with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Polly</font> fencing using long weed swords. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> tried to protect the 
weeds briefly, but soon joined in. Since no one was paying any attention, they called it quits and swung low.</p>

<p>On back they went, out of the school and east on Hawkins Street, crossing over 146. Turning right on Branch Avenue, 
they soon came to the cars. Parking lot nakedness ensued, as they changed in the dusk. They convoyed to the On On On at 
the East Ave Café in Pawtucket. As always, they were tolerated but not appreciated as they sang and behaved, both badly. 
There is no trash in Pawtucket, or at least there wasn’t until we arrived!</p>
