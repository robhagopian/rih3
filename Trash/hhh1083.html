<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Haring on the first day of the year has its rewards. It assuredly will be the best Hash of the year, and if all works 
out well, the pack will be so hung over from the previous night’s activities they may not be aware how pathetic the trail 
may actually be. This was the case for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, but it’s my job to set the record straight, 
even if he isn’t.</p>

<p>The directions were sufficient to allow a fairly good size contingent to arrive at 2PM, an early start for a RIH3 
event. Even the Wankers from Bean Town, who are always on Hash Time, arrived just after the start. They lost little time 
in catching the pack, as we crossed Old River Road on the way to beautiful downtown Manville. This name connotes a town 
named after the RIH3, but is quite misleading, as there are many women here, and most were imported from Canada during the 
early part of our nation’s history. They were quiet efficient in cooking, cleaning and keeping the beds warm at night, so 
the local Frenchmen brought them down by the bucket loads. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> father was among them. He 
chose a quiet petite Canadian/Squaw who was quick with a smile or knife depending upon the situation. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> takes after her that way.</p>

<p>A check at the corner of Mowry and Division streets had us off in all directions of the compass, but true trail was 
found heading north on Division to Bouvier. Unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was heading west on 
Central, a dead end and had to bushwhack through some back yards, where he met up with <font color="#FF0000">Friar
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Mr Rogers</font>.</p> 

<p>The fact that our Hare was setting this on all roads was causing some of us to consider turning back and having a beer 
at the Harmony Café just around the corner. This bar was notorious as the location of a confrontation between the 
bartender lady and our own <font color="#FF0000">Red Snapper</font> a few years ago. <font color="#FF0000">RS</font> asked 
the somewhat disheveled barmaid if she was on drugs causing her to complain loudly brining the local patrons from the 
front room back to see what all the commotion was about. In the bathroom later, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
overheard two locals at the trough saying how they were going to ‘fix’ these arseholes. The event ended with the RIH3 
sneaking out the back door before the locals strung us up for messin’ with their lady(?), but that’s another story.</p>

<p>The trail continued down Railroad Street, where the sneaky hare placed his marks on the river side and hidden behind 
the road barrier and telephone poles, but <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> saw his 
ruse and led the pack towards Woonsocket. There were many opportunities to go left and up trails towards the power lines, 
but the timid hare has just gotten over his nightmares of Woonsocket’s finest, gun in hand, placing him alone in the back 
of the squad car, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, ‘You’ll never take me alive Copper!” wasn’t going to go there 
ever again.</p>

<p>So the pack plodded along the road, complaining that this was no way to cure a hangover, and why didn’t we just stay at 
home and have a Bloody Mary’s instead. At least there should be a beer stop shortly and we could cool our heels a bit, but 
that didn’t happen. No we continued until we found ourselves entering the hills of Bernon Street and eventually the west 
end of Woonsocket itself.</p>

<p>The trail meandered along riverside streets until we came out at River Island Park and crossing the Blackstone, we 
finally found a good check at Old English Fish and Chips. From here we continued up River and we knew there would be no 
beer until we made it to the hare’s house. So we dropped the charade of following marks and ran the most direct route to 
Meadow Rd., where <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was already pouring himself a pint and giggling at the displeasure 
written all over our faces. The stragglers arrived slowly, with DFL’s <font color="#FF0000">Friar</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Muff</font> arriving some time later.</p>

<p>The circle was finally started and comments from Best Hash (from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>) to ”WORST HASH of 
the YEAR” was repeated by all.  It’s interesting to watch as more <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> Brew is consumed the '
better the Hash becomes, and soon we were all singings phrases to the lord, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  Then we 
adjourned to the vestibule for some post religion snacks and beverages. The Hare wanted to make something different, so we 
were introduced to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (no salt) Meat Pie following in his Canadian tradition. There’s no 
wonder why the mortality rate was so high back then. This was the only time the hash left food on the table when we left 
for the night. Luckily Ben has a taste for road kill and ate the remaining 5 pies were that were not frozen and saved for 
our next hash event here.</p>
