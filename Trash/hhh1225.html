girlfriend-related excuse. As if the all-gay RIH3 wasn’t enough for him. 
MARCO!), and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> had jumped in to substitute. 
That’s TWO injuries that <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> will have to pay for! 
The start was in the Double-D parking lot just before Rt. 116 on Rt 7. Virgin 
territory. For about 25 yards. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

color=#000000><FONT size=3>At 6:30 promptly, they were off. Trail led behind the 
Dunkin’ Donuts southwest, paralleling the George Washington Highway. There was 
some light shiggy, and trail was promptly lost. Most came out onto the road and 
continued, assuming that they would enter the woods on John Mowry Road, or 
perhaps even continue down to the 116 bridge. But the few that actually followed 
trail (<FONT color=#ff0000>Rusty</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Foaming Head</FONT>) found marks crossing the road, and 
proceeding north on the powerlines.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

pipeline. <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> couldn’t believe that the trail 
could be this short. So he led the FRB’s right past the well-concealed “B” and 
continued into the Hanton City Woods. Ha, Ha! <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
knew it would pay to be so slow. The BC was reached by the rest of the pack, and 
the beer found, and opened. A few desultory efforts were made to call the 
bastards back. Luckily, they were out of 
earshot.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000><FONT size=3>Having enjoyed their beer and a few songs, the hare 
indicated that they were to continue southeast. A brief trip in the woods proved 
to be too much exertion for the pack. So they simply turned down a nicely paved 
and well-lit road (that was obviously the beginning of a new development that 
would further urbanize some previously fine hashing territory.) Coming out on 
Rt. 7, they went back to the cars.<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

the cars. Ratings for the run: no bimbos, pitiful shiggy, pavement, and the 
presence of<FONT color=#ff0000> Bondo Jovi</FONT> were powerful negatives. But 
the loss of the FRB’s, the shortness of the run, and the ever-present fondness 
of the RIH3 for powerlines made the total: +0.69. Hashit went to <FONT

attending the On On On. His wife must have been out of town. And afterwards, the 
hash promoted good-will by helping out a guy in the parking lot whose radiator 
hose had broken. What is the world coming
