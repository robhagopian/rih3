<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Why so many 
showed up for what was billed as a <FONT color=#ff0000>JIMA</FONT> run, in WAY 
overused territory, is one of those eerie and inexplicable mysteries that will 
never be solved. The Lodge food ain’t that good! But nevertheless, a good crowd 
was there at the start. The substitute hare, trying to maintain the fiction that 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Justin My Ass</FONT> had anything to do with this mess, 
stated that the hare had prelaid before the rains, and was delayed by a late 
class. Excuses for a virtually unmarked trail? Pretty likely, I think. With the 
threat that the Boston travelling hashers might arrive at any second, they were 
off promptly.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> found trail first, heading north and west from the 
parking lot past the usual circling-up point, and crossing the stream feeding 
the small pond just west of the Lodge. Getting wet was only optional. Wresting 
through some briars, they emerged in the fields behind the YMCA. The pack fell 
into disarray here. Even the hare couldn’t find his marks. Finally, he took the 
lead and the rest followed. The trail led slightly west of north. Here and there 
a mark was seen, but the young and fit visitors soon realized that they would 
either get no exercise, or end up totally lost if they tried to outpace the hare 
by too much.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The trail for 
the most part was on overgrown paths. The feeding branches of the Moshassuck 
river were crossed several times. Some swampy areas were encountered. But for 
the most part, they stayed on the contour line, mid-hill, parallel to Rt 146. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, 
along with <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Nathaniel</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Haines</FONT> led. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> hung back, 
mostly because he enjoys the sounds of <FONT color=#ff0000>Cumsockit To 
Me</FONT> whining. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Max</FONT> was wishing he had stayed 
home.<FONT color=#ff0000> Bondo</FONT> turned around, and went home. A 
frightening and unusual show of intelligence on his part. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> got lost. The 'hare' lost his own trail for a 
while.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Finally, they 
reached Sherman Ave. Despite the lack of marks, <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> managed to find trail across the street, heading towards the quarry 
from Run # 829, now a lake. The hare stopped the group, and retrieved the beer. 
A fine beer check it was, too. No <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, No <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, and no annoying Bostonians. With newcomers present, 
the singing began. And went on, and on, and on on. Finally running low on beer, 
they were directed back by the hare. His instructions were ignored, and the lead 
group of <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Haines</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Nathaniel</FONT> 
simply followed their instincts and paralleled 146 a little east of south. They 
found some new shiggy on the way. The hare, <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey 
Punch</FONT> and the bimbos followed trail closer to 146. They really missed 
out.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">As they made 
their way back across the river, they noticed some suspicious lights and animal 
noises coming from the hill behind The Lodge parking lot. Ignoring these, the 
circle was formed. Only to be rudely interrupted by <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing 
</FONT>and the Boston crowd coming off the hill drawn by the scent of 
beer.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The run was 
rated. Shiggy, bimbos, lack of <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> were strong 
positives. But the lack of marks, lack of virgin territory, and lack of a 
competent hare (this applies to both <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>JIMA</FONT>) were equally relevant. Total: -6.9. The visitors, 
two-timers and backsliders were dealt with. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Kathy</FONT> had hurt her toe, and was named <FONT color=#ff0000>Crack-Her 
Toe-ah</FONT>. Imaginative, if obscure. Despite some efforts, a name for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just MJ</FONT> could not be agreed upon. Hashit went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Not the hare, after all. The group finally went 
into The Lodge, and the evening finally ended.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
