It was one of those evenings when a quick glance of the weather forecast would have 
revealed more about the run than one could ever imagine. Those WHO checked the 
weather stayed at home, the 15 that didn't believe the forecast showed up and it pissed 
down on them in amounts that would turn a 10lb bag of flour into a real big mess. <br/><br/>

A couple of visitors from Northboro MA travelled the 69 miles to Quonsett to check out 
the RIH3, they would leave amused and looking forward to a return visit. They also 
promised to brush up on some ditties (rhymes with kitties) to sing to us at a future 
gathering. <br/><br/>

Meanwhile the hare was seen, in his truck, departing the parking lot a mere 20 minutes 
before the start. Just Keri had misplaced her car keys and he was en-route to Providence 
to provide some quick service. However, he returned shortly thereafter with a big smile 
on his face and told us that said keys had been located and he was off the hook. The pack 
was disappointed; we had planned on doing a really short trail and drinking the beer that 
had been left in the good stead of Hairy K. And, as the soggy clock touched 6:31 we were 
on trail. Hairy had mentioned that Wee Balls had informed him to look out for the two 
marks on the bike path. This was a fortuitous comment as Dr WHO & Rusty ignored the 
first mark and continued along said bike path until mark #2 was found. <br/><br/>

The pack was directed around the capped landfill, the remainder of the pack could be 
seen across the water after they had opted to follow the first bike path mark. Even with a 
gentle drizzle coming down they soon found true trail and tried to catch up with the 
FRB's. The drizzle turned to a steady rain as the Hare informed us that the trail did 
indeed go into the shrubbery and through the knee deep golden shiggy (remnants from 
the landfill??), WeeBalls continued to shout "are you" despite knowing full well that 
AssQuack and Fuwangi would have to come back out. Flour ended, the pack had gone 
quiet, and the rain was now at such a torrential level that Bondo headed back to the 
warmth of his truck and all trail marks disappeared. <br/><br/>

It was too soon for a return to the cars, so ButtPlug led the way up the bike path until we 
came to an arrow that directed us south towards the water again. An interesting circle 
with an X placed on center drew confusion but the hare appeared out of nowhere and 


advised the back runners to head to the Beer which was atop a large sand dune. In the 
distance the silhouettes of Dr WHO and SheMaleMan could be seen at the beer stop, they 
looked like they were digging for gold which was partly true because they were actually 
scrambling to find the buried IPA before the rest of us arrived. Confusion arose as soon 
as the bottles were pulled from the backpack, bottle caps numbered 1 through 3 were 
stout and 4 through 13 were IPA. Some smartarse suggested changing the caps around to 
add to the confusion but sanity prevailed and we drank and sang instead. WHO recounted 
the story of his interaction with a wild bird on trail, they tried to out stare each other until 
WHO couldn't take it anymore and finally left. <br/><br/>

In hashing there are moments that are remembered forever, usually spontaneous & totally 
innocent comments that are forever recorded in RIH3 lore only to be brought up again at 
the most inopportune of moments, such a moment occurred tonight when Crabby Shag 
said "punch a cunt". Google searches have revealed little about this expression other than 
to say "when the going gets tough, you should punch the cunt that is making it tough". 
Checking the dictionary one could be excused for thinking that said remark could have 
something to do with a WIPOS run. Speaking of WIPOS, it looked like he was running 
towards the beer stop as we all watched in wonderment from atop the sandy knoll. the 
tide was coming in and he didn't want to be late. This incoming tide would see us wander 
through 6 inch deep sea water as we did our Butt Plug trail back to the cars. <br/><br/>

It was at this point that we met Basket, he had arrived late, gotten lost while driving to the 
start and had gone off for a beer instead of waiting for our return. The circle started 
shortly thereafter just as the rain stopped, the hare got his just rewards and as usual Rusty 
was given hash shit because he previously promised to never ever nominate anyone 
again. <br/><br/>

We started to pack up and leave only to be greeted by two speeding cruisers, they 
departed quickly once they were told WHO was in charge. 

The OnOn was held at Gillians, where we had some naked burgers and pints of gold.
