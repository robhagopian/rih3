<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>With d’erections posted on the website at least TWELVE hours before starting time, it was generally felt that the hare 
was trying to save on beer money as always by discouraging attendance. But the hare didn’t count on the strange phenomenon 
of the last month. Visitors and virgins have been coming out of the woodwork, and this night was to be no exception. Five 
(six) visitors and a virgin all made it to the overcrowded parking lot of Chelo’s in Apple Valley Plaza on Rt 44 in plenty 
of time for the start.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived and began an exaggerated limp around the parking lot. (“I fell off a 5.8!” 
he boasted. More like a 6.9, probably.) He claimed that <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> was not far behind, so the 
hare gave some hurried instructions, and took a head count. The attendance prompted some rapid calculations. He quickly 
dispatched his lovely co-hare to get more beer. (Next time, you go get it, you lazy wank, and leave your lovely co-hare to 
the pack! But I digress!) At 6:35, they were off east to the powerlines.</p>

<p>A falsie led north on the powerline trail, fooling <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Cainus
</font> briefly. Much too briefly, as it turned out. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, whining about his recent 
climbing injury, limped on true trail continuing east in the woods. A check had <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
leading the pack straight. They continued on a long trail to the cemetery on the hill above the home Depot in Smithfield 
crossing. They were greeted by a “YBF”. Ha, ha!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Donkey Punch</font> had turned left at the check, as <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> realized that the trail had to go back to the powerlines at some point. Late arrival <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> had realized that from the start, and was already FRB on the powerlines. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> likewise had turned back early and was hobbling up the powerline trail just behind. This is 
why one needs to find virgin territory with this crew.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was easily able to find the beer, and as the rest caught up, the supplies became 
dangerously low. But the hare arrived with a garbage bag of fresh stuff, and the BC was saved. The rhubarb of course rose. 
The Happy Valley Never-Ending version of “Scotland Depraved” (the lassie with the wee hairy assie…) was sung. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> claimed <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> was not far behind. <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Miranda</font> arrived, having shown up even later than <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. Four weeks in a row! And she’s 
bought a headlight! Seems like the hash is going to have to come up with a REALLY offensive name to keep her away. 
Otherwise this could mean the end of the All-gay RIH3!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> appeared. He had apparently lost Ben (Current Acting GM). All these years, he’s been 
trying to kill Ben, and could tonight be the night?  Or would it just be another night in the Smithfield pound for the 
GM? (It is a lovely dog pound. One of Ben’s favorites. Clean newspaper, canned food and fresh reservoir water, and all.) 
Or did Ben get waylaid by the amorous <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>? <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> looked 
worried. The rest were relieved and hopeful.</p>

<p>With a few beers still left, they packed up and headed back, south on the west side of the powerlines. Trail marks 
became sparse. But they were being ignored anyways. Except by the gimpy <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, who was 
trying to get some sympathy from the virgin, and ended up getting temporarily lost by trying to actually follow trail. At 
the start, the hash had told the virgin the one sacred law: Never Follow <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>! And there 
she was, stuck in the woods alone with the half-blind Quasimodo of the RIH3, stuck listening to his endless stories, stuck 
worrying whether he would take off his clothes at any moment. Live and learn!</p>

<p>The circle finally formed, just in time for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and the virgin to emerge during the 
long note of “The Monks”. Ratings: Trail was short, trail was dry. There was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, Ben was 
lost. There was a virgin, there was <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. There were five bimbos, there WERE FIVE BIMBOS! 
But there was limited briar shiggy, and not one foot of virgin territory. Total: <b>+2.0</b>!! (This is a result of all 
these young folk and their la-di-da New Math!  The real total was clearly <b>+0.69</b>.) The virgin was questioned, and 
told a joke. The visitors were interrogated. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, because <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> has been getting too attached to it (or it’s contents!)</p>

<p>After religion, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> went of to search for Ben, 
while the rest packed up and drove to Effin’s, and actually made it there despite the wildly divergent directions offered 
by the group. The pool was open but no one was tempted. Food and beer was served, and in some cases mixed together. As 
always. And as the Yankees season landed in the well-deserved garbage heap, the evening ended on a fine note.</p>

<p>Epilogue, courtesy of Basket Boom Boom:</p>

<p>The Story of Ben<br>
To the tune of the Beverly Hillbillies.</p>
 
<p>I’ll tell you a story ‘bout a dog named Ben<br>
A livin’ with Bondo, he didn’t have a friend.<br>
Said I’m goin’ Hashin’ in Smithfield ya see<br>
So he jumped in the van and drove with Jovi.<br>
Bondo that is Ahhhhchtu. (spit)</p>
 
<p>Well they arrive at the Hash just as it started out<br>
So he ran past Bondo as he is kinda stout.<br>
Up with the FRB’s scounting out the trail<br>
Sniffin’ at the ground and at the girlies’ tail.<br>
Hmmm. Sumthin’ smells good, not like Bondo Ahhhhchtu (spit).</p>
 
<p>As the leader of the pack he was feelin’ kinda good<br>
Sniffin’ all around, and a gettin’ some wood<br>
Till he found a dead possum an he started to a drool<br>
Then just started in a eatin’, like a damn fool.<br>
Just like Bondo, thinkin’ ‘bout himself. Ahhhhchtu (spit).</p>
 
<p>Well he ate so long, well the Hash was outa sight.<br>
Staggered round the power lines in the dark of night.<br>
Till the Smithfield Po lice grabbed him by the neck<br>
And stuck him in a cage alone, what the heck.<br>
Basket couldn’t find and Bondo didn’t try Ahhhhchtu (spit).</p>
 
<p>Well next day early, Just Big Shit gave a call<br>
They said he was here but that wasn’t all<br>
He had a case of shits from eatin’ all that food<br>
Shat on the cage and floor, that was kinda rude.<br>
Shit smell, like bad Bondo beer that is. Ahhhhchtu (spit).</p>
 
<p>So that is the story of Ben the dog last night.<br>
Runnin’ off alone, givin’ us a fright.<br>
But next Monday, you can bet your stinky ass,<br>
He’ll be back with us again, sniffin’ at the Lass<br>
Bimbos that is, not like Bondo, Ahhhhchtu (spit)..</p>
