<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Caratunk Wildlife Sanctuary, Seekonk, MA</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Clear, high 70’s</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Dr W.H.O., Async, Fuwangi Boner, Tinker, Basket Boom Boom,

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Finally given a break from hashing in Burrillville, a larger group than usual turned up, hoping for something 
different. And it was virgin territory. With a bimbo hare. <font color="#FF0000">WHO </font>could resist (but didn’t). 
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> the hare had finally found a safe entry point into one of the sacred haunts of the 
Southeast NE Chapter of the Audubon Society. This group is no friends to hashers or hounds of any sort. The Caratunk 
Wildlife Sanctuary prohibits alcohol. It prohibits running. It prohibits pets. It prohibits loud or vulgar language. A 
perfect spot for a hash.</p>

<p>The group gathered at the end of a cul-de-sac by the powerlines north of the actual sanctuary. The visitor was greeted. 
And, as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had not arrived yet, the start was prompt at 6:30. They entered the woods 
southeast on the powerlines. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> led, and quickly 
found trail heading east on some Caratunk paths.</p>

<p>The group spread out somewhat, heading on a counterclockwise loop on the Hemlock trail through a grove of Beech trees. 
Some hemlock would have come in handy to feed to the hare when it was realized that this was just a big circle-jerk. 
&nbsp;But the hare was playing it crafty and hanging back as she had to revise some marks along the way to keep the pack 
on track. The confusion in the woods deepened. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> found true trail heading back west 
across an orderly progression of bridges over a nice bog. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> had followed, and thoughtfully overturned the bridges to ensure that those following wouldn’t miss out as 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>had. They crossed back over the powerlines, and across Cole’s Brook to an observation 
platform and some fields.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led briefly as trail circled the field and then turned around Muskrat Pond. Most of 
those behind followed <font color="#FF0000">Async’s</font> lead and skipped this unnecessary loop. They turned south then 
back east to the powerlines. Trail led through some nice swamp. Almost everyone was happy, although some wished for some 
more briars. Somehow, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was now sharing the lead with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
and the visitor as trail turned back uphill northwest parallel to the powerlines to the top of the hill and the beer 
check. The hare had hidden the stash of beer well, but finally it was found and opened. Unfortunately it could not be 
finished before <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> struggled in, DFL. He gave his usual story about trying to outwit the 
hare, and boasted about the great shiggy he had found. Will he never learn?</p>

<p>The beer check was marked by an extraordinary density of mosquitoes, an extraordinary beer shortage, as well as an 
extraordinarily long and pointless rendition of “A is for A” (i.e. “A long strong black pudding up my sister’s cat’s 
a**hole…”) by <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>. This annoying song would still 
be going had not the pack decided to drown the pair out with “There was a little bird”. The visitor was quite confused. 
But the beer was gone, and the mosquitoes were satisfied, so they moved on.</p>

<p>Trail on-in led down the steepest part of the hill (resulting in a few scrapes and bruises), crossing the brook 
briefly, then turning back for an unnecessary but refreshing crossing of the mud of the Ice Pond back to the powerlines. 
It was straight back north then northwest to the cars, reusing the trail in from the beginning. They brought in some more 
beer to circle up out of earshot form the houses and circled up. Marks for the hash were in general good: Fine swamp, 
excellent biting pests, near-loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, virgin trails. But the beer shortage, the 
non-loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and the clear weather were strong counter-arguments, so the hare was left 
with a +0.69. The visitor could provide no intelligible reason for joining the group so was duly punished. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font> Once it was clear that a second flock of mosquitoes were fully sated, they had 
religion and moved on to the on on on at Tort’s.</p>

<p>At Tort’s, it was karaoke night. And the festivities commenced just after the food and beer had been delivered to the 
hash. The painful and sickening sights and sounds that followed were too awful to recount. Suffice it to say that the 
RIH3 should let some considerable time pass before revisiting Seekonk, and that karaoke providers in this area should 
delete all “old favorites”, Beatles, and Simon and Garfunkel songs from their offerings on Monday nights.</p>
