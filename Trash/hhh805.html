<p>With everyone fighting each other in the name of God, God was conspicuously
absent visiting hapless grandchildren in Cleveland. Nor was there the good
Doctor nor the lovely Shine-On with the latter realizing there were healthier
ways to endure abuse without exposing yourself to poison-ivy or sub-zero temps. </p>
<p>Everyone gathered at the start promptly on time as <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
promised a virgin, or maybe he said virgin-trail. This was hard to believe as
Tarbox Pond is vying with Glendale as the most hash-abused area in RI.
Nevertheless, the pack was sent NW to the pond skirting the shore then off to
the West to the first check that led further West with most of the pack together
then to a couple of more checks. By this time, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
was on his own engaging in quite possibly K9 fornication as Baxter has been
mysteriously tired at the end of runs and declining beer for nicotine. Also <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
too was missing but was equipped by a satellite-guiding sensor, and the hare. </p>
<p>The pack made the checks and were joined by <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>as
they were led to a swamp! Now there was trail that went around the swamp but
that would have been 2 more miles. Eager to reach the BC, the pack braved the
freezing snapping-turtle infested waters with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
leading the way followed by the cyclops-<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and
the <font color="#FF0000">Beaver</font> with <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>
keeping the rear...now you see him now you don't!&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>,
depressed by the absence of his favourite hashers <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Shine-On</font>, dove into the swamp in an attempt to
kill himself.&nbsp; In the mold of a non-interfering shrink, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
turned away to let him pull himself out of this mess. Unfortunately, still
unaware that he held onto his dogs leash, she (too, unknowingly) dragged him to
shore, no sooner did she realize this she woofed celibacy and swore never to
lick Jakes testicles again! Wet with swamp, altho <font color="#FF0000">Miss
Eager</font> swore she had been wet ever since she laid eyes on Baxter; the pack
was met with a grinning hare and back on trail.</p>
<p>Still no <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS!</font> The trail led uphill and thru
two more checks to a Turkey/Eagle split. Here <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
(that crafty muslim sneak) erased the T and ensured all would do the eagle. Up
more hill (what are we training for? Afghanistan?) and down again thru more
checking and onto a lovely trail (barely visible now that it was pitch-dark) and
needing considerable ducking to avoid the vines taking your eye esp. if you have
only one like <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> on your head, no not that
head! Up another hill and a yellow glare was visible over the rocks...could this
be the glare over Kandahar maybe? Eager to join the jihad, the pack picked up
pace and over the rocky hill to a fire and a sight quite as bad as the Osama
himself: <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>reclining on a chair enjoying a beer
by the fire! Warmth and beer greeted the weary wet...and upon <font color="#FF0000">PW's</font>
urging, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>sang fifty songs. The fire was
appreciated as the temp dipped to freezing. Beer consumed and fire extinguished,
the pack followed trail out. Now half blind as both <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Eagar Beaver </font>had their batteries ran out. </p>
<p>The pack soon made it out to the start and the cars. Circle at the pond, and
down down to the hare with a 9.6 rating from the <font color="#FF0000">Eager
Hoover</font>; the hashit was settled upon <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> for
never, never going to the ONONs (editors note:and you miss him?). The ONON was
at Mikes Grille:we have yet to be thrown out from here!&nbsp; Good grub and beer
consumed,the pack listened to the earnest arguments from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
against war and to question our leaders and do some soul-searching as to why we
as Americans are so loved around the world, and were unanimous in denouncing the
indiscriminate attacks currently under way and ended the night with a prayer to
the Almighty Bodishattva <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for peace.A-Hash</p>
