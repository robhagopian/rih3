<p>The hares this week were <font color="#CC0000">BasketBB </font>(this time for
real) and <font color="#CC0000">Stuff the Clam</font>, saying farewell to
arguably the best hash in the world! </p>
<p>Gathered for the run included fellow navymen <font color="#CC0000">Festering
Gaping Hole,Just Brian</font>, <font color="#CC0000">Just Nate</font> and virgin
<font color="#CC0000">Just John</font>, along with pretty lass <font color="#CC0000">Just
Sonia</font>; old timers <font color="#CC0000">WIPOS, Dr. WhoSlasher</font>,
yours truly (in glorious kilt and hairdo); with visitors from Bahstan <font color="#CC0000">StuffMe</font>
and <font color="#CC0000">Bag O'Porn</font>. We all gathered at the all too
familiar Cady's Tavern in Glostah. <font color="#CC0000">Async</font> was
conspicously absent. Was it that he had set trail so many times here that he
concluded that the likelihood of there being virgin trail was as slim as Basket
keeping his knickers on for one hash, OR was it that being Robbie Burns memorial
haggis would be served and he feared there just wouldn't be enough of it to go
around...? </p>
<p>Anyway, the navy and visitors gathered at the Tavern for a quickie, joined by
<font color="#CC0000">Ooze</font> and soon <font color="#CC0000">Basket </font>with
the Haggis. Beer was finished, and the pack was sent off with a blessing across
Rt.44 towards Bowdish reservoir. Most wore crosscountry skis and snowshoes, some
settling for shoes, the pack took a right into the park and after a stutter
found trail heading off into the woods. Soon delightful screams were heard from
the lasses ostensibly from having difficulty maneuvering the skis and not
someone's periscope!&nbsp; After going thru a few checks, <font color="#CC0000">Just
Brian</font> and <font color="#CC0000">John, Hole</font> and <font color="#CC0000">Oozing</font>
went deeper into the woods then down straight onto the....lake!&nbsp; After a
few very nervous steps trail led us towards the middle of the lake.&nbsp; We
were told it was frozen with well over 6.9 inches of snow. And <font color="#CC0000">Async</font>
expected no virgin trail!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>As we led the pack blowing our horns, we realized the others were well
behind!&nbsp; <font color="#CC0000"> Stuff the Crab</font> headed back to
recoup...while we forged on bravely and the scribe remarking how cool it would
be to just cross the lake and have a BC at old timer <font color="#CC0000">Sofa
Spud's</font> home, well more on that later.... Finally after what seemed an
eternity, we reached the otherside, crossed the road, and back into the woods
with some checks looping and circle jerking us for awhile, back into civilized
area and trail got lost...until <font color="#CC0000">Stuff the Lamb</font> came
back, leading us across the road again, down Bowdish way onto .....<font color="#CC0000">Sofa
Spuds!</font> </p>
<p>The pack, thanks to <font color="#CC0000">Basket</font> were well into their
third beer when we got there. <font color="#CC0000">Sofa</font> was missing, I
mean <font color="#CC0000">Basket</font> had told him we would be there and he
wasn't there to greet us?&nbsp; Come to think of it why would anyone stop
running with this delightful bunch?&nbsp; Life's mysteries. We sang and drank on
the porch, with an odd couple watching us. Before they could call the cops, the
hare sent us off back across the lake.&nbsp; By this time the temp was dropping
fast and the sky was clear and Brian gave me a small astronomy
lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the other side and we end up at that familiar hut,
only this time we did start a fire and kept it going. </p>
<p>Downdowns to the hares with general comments incl. crap, shite etc...,and <font color="#CC0000">Stuff
the Rabbit </font>sang a lovely ode to his fellow Rhody Hashers...ah so sweet!
Down downs to the virgin, and the visitors and<font color="#CC0000"> Stuffie </font>decided
to flash us instead of singing, and <font color="#CC0000">Dr. Who</font>
thinking his family had no talent! Hashit went back to<font color="#CC0000">
WIPOS</font>, altho I would have personally given it to that <font color="#CC0000">Oozing</font>
who defamed the kilt by wearing something underneath! We headed back to the
tavern and enjoyed the haggis and beer and said prayer in Burn's own words. The
boys lovingly distributed govt issued shirts, and Basket felt 20 years younger,
but chose to swap it with a local wench, who thought she could take her shirt
off without taking off her top but nearly ended up naked and sent her
running!&nbsp; Bag O' Porn was Alouetted...and then we buggered off close to
midnight!&nbsp;&nbsp; May the soul of Robbie Burns hammie fist ya, Aye! </p>
