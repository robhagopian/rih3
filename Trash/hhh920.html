<p><br><font color="#008000">Run #920</font>; December 1, 2003<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> Fuwangi Boner (Slinky, thin strap tight cocktail dress)<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Cohare: </font>Granola Balls (NH3) (Satiny Pleated dress, concealed by extensive outerwear)<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Cumberland Medical Center, Nate Whipple and Staples Rd, Cumberland.<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Low 40's, windy and cold<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font><font color="#FF0000"> Dr WHO </font> (Matronly full length with ornamental red 
buttons), <font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD</font> (Red Plaid Kiltie), <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> (Classic Red 
Dress), <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> (White Lab Coat, the wank!), <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
(Shortsleeve Red Kevlar), <font color="#FF0000">EB RIPTA </font>(NH3) (Red Jacket, at least), Seamus and Alpine (NH3).
<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><br>First, a photo Op with the owner of the &quot;Valley Breeze&quot;, local weekly, who was given inside info by his 
wife who works with <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> at MHRI, and who took both action photos and still life shots in the 
freezing wind. Then they were off NE on Staples road briefly, turning into the woods left at the power line substation. 
Trail followed the power line path along the shores of Sneech Pond; <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> kept trying to go right uphill, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> followed true trail NW until the trail broke away from the power lines as they entered the pond (missed 
opportunity). Marks were noted to be microscopic; obviously conserving flour was a priority. Trail climbed NE up Copper 
Mine Hill and joined a pipeline access heading NW again. A few areas of pitiful shiggy flooding the path were easily 
avoided and a ridge was crested to the BC.<br><br>

At the BC there was the usual posturing and posing by the hare and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and it happened 
that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> told the tale of his last trip through the orchard at the end of the pipeline 
access on a hash some years ago, where an enraged owner chased him and some others with a shotgun, making the hare comment 
uneasily that his trail led through some orchard, and he had in fact been briefly chased himself whilst setting trail 
earlier. The prospect of being chased at gunpoint through an orchard wearing red dresses was too much for most so the hare 
agreed to live hare a different way back. A brief foray east led to a blind trail and a fall down a cliff, so the hare 
returned before anyone had had a chance to leave, and reversed tracks down the pipeline access.<br><br>

Finally leaving the beer check, the hashers all took turns hefting the half-full cooler of beer. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tried to carry it together briefly, causing Oozing to get the only 
exposure to shiggy on the run as <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>forced him into the flooded part of the path. They 
came out at the large water tank, and finally realized that if they had a second beer check, the damned cooler wouldn't 
weigh so much. A second beer check was begun, finding two rusted bikes that <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> claimed, and ignoring the plaintive whistles of the hare from the bottom of the hill.<br><br>

From BC #2, it was a short jog SE down the hill, made more interesting by the attempt of <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> to ride their new possessions. A right turn near the bottom of the 
hill back into the woods and they circled up.<br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">Ratings:</font> 6.9 for Red Dresses with Beer, Bimbos, and Bikes!<br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">Hashit:</font> Need you ask? <font color="#FF0000">Basket!</font><br><br>

On On On: Tucks, with prolonged childishness and food missles, only <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> trying to calm the 
crowd as he planned to start his run from Tuck's next week.</p>
