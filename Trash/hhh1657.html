The ladies decided a good up and down, on a rocky trail was just the ticket for tonight's Hash. As 6:30 rolled around, the Hares showed us the light orange chalk the trail would be set with. Unless a bright light was shown directly on it, it was invisible to me. I think they had that in mind all along. As it turned out Just Pat has a similar color deficiency and he was unable to see the marks too. We enjoyed a beer waiting for the horn to sound and allow the wankers to put on a second layer as the temperature was dropping quickly.<br/><br/>
At 6:30 we started out against the complaints of Just Pat, WHO was still on Boston Hash Time. The trail led down through the fence towards the rocky outcropping where we often had a beer stop. The Hare answered my question about the BS location, that it would not be found there, but you knew we'd be making our way up there just the same. We passed a couple that were either living in the Hobo Village just ahead, or enjoyed some sex or smoke as they had just gone down there while we were waiting to start out.<br/><br/>
The flour was invisible to most of us, and it took Rusty to point them out to Just Pat and I, but that didn't stop us from being FRB's. After crossing a debris field from the construction of Dowling Village, we started up the left path towards the top of the rocks. Donkey led us half way and started back down until Rusty spotted the smidgen of orange dust lightly smattered on the glistening snow. The tree of us made it to the check at the top and Rusty and I followed the power lines towards Millville. Krisco Kid was already on the left path and turned back without any signs of flour. Once again, it took Rusty's trusty light to point out the marks and that we were again FRBs.<br/><br/>
Trail led downhill and at the next check we went right. Evidently, the remainder of the pack went left and was out of sight for some time. We traversed the next hill. I went right bushwhacking to the top, Rusty left along the trail and Just Pat was playing with himself somewhere. Rusty heard the sweet sound of "Beer Stop" and we followed the trail to the lights just ahead. Beers were enjoyed along with orange food and singing. A question about the Hobo Village prompted someone to point out the fire off in the distance. OB suggested the fire was for our entertainment and we had a rolling Beer Stop in that direction.<br/><br/>
After a number of songs along with a beer, and the warming fire, it was decided to have the Circle here, away from the maddening crowd. Comments on the trail were mostly positive with Rusty complaining, again, how he had to show the two wankers in front of him were the trail went. Other negatives were related to the small flour marks, the color and not inviting the hobos to join us. Then Santa showed up and agreed the run was 'mostly' not overly too badly done. The Hares had their DownDown and sung an interesting song I'd not heard before. We should get the words to that ditty as well as the Dead Seal song. Basket did a rendition of Eskimo Nell. Krisco tried to explain why he's been absent of late. Hashit went to OOzing for no other reason but that he should have it. <br/><br/>
The On On was at the Texas Rhode (Island Hash) House, where we were thrilled by Basket's riding the bull and more beer with our ribs. God bless the Hash. God bless the Hares. God bless Basket's parents. And God Bless America. Amen and Happy Holidays.<br/><br/>
