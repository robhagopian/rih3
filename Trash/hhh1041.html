<p><font color="#008000">Run #1041</font>, March 13, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Great at Giving Head</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Carolina Trout Pond, Richmond</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; mid 40’s, misty/fog.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Amish It Head, Basket Boom Boom, Dry Foot Fairy, Oozing SD, Cum 
Under PSHS, Seamus. Visitors: Pork-a-Orca (Okinawa H3), Cum Titty NH Seacoast H3), Butt Wiper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hash returned to the deep south (of RI) with deep misgivings. The hare’s last efforts in Westerly were so bad, not 
even <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> has been able to muster up the strength to do a writeup. So in fairness to the 
hare, here’s the writeup for Run #1032: <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish It Head</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD</font>, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom 
Boom</font>, Seamus (and  <font color="#FF0000">Cumonder PSHS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> 
late) joined the hare at a Boat Ramp in downtown Westerly. Trail led them on a long, unnecessary and boring 
counterclockwise loop through the streets of Westerly. The snow didn’t cushion the painful impact of all that asphalt. No 
one got lost. There was a beer check in a sleazy bar, that ran out of decent beer, so they were stuck with BUD!!! Not even 
Seamus would finish the pitcher. More pavement, and then it was finally over. They circled. <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font> tried to drown himself. <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> was hashit. They had the On On On in a 
restaurant across the river in CT, and massaged their shin splints through dinner.</p>

<p>O.K. Now that that’s over with, this hare was up again. Wisely, he settled on Carolina North, starting from the Trout 
Pond. The run was nearly over before it started as the hare bribed <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> with beer from 
his trunk. But a visitor arrived. Shame made the run necessary. And <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> was heard from, 
bringing a special mystery guest.  Not wanting the visitor to run away from what is becoming the Brokeback Hash, they all 
decided to wait for the womenfolk. Then they took off on a long, unnecessary and boring counterclockwise loop through the 
trails of Carolina. No one got lost. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> tried to drown himself. <font color="#FF0000">Cum 
Under</font> was hashit. Sound familiar? All right, all right! I’ll give more details.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> had brought <font color="#FF0000">Cum Titty</font> from NH with her. She, like 
so many, had been a victim of the Rumney Ski hash, and hoped to catch another glimpse of <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> naked. Luckily, she was disappointed. All present, they were on out at 6:50. Trail led south on the access 
Road, then turned into the woods east on the Shippee Trail. At the first check, they started uphill, still on the Shippee 
Trail. No one was lost, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Porc-a-Orca</font> led. At the 
second check, most chose to turn west on the Essex trail. They were correct. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> chose to 
continue up hill. Wrong again, but this time it led him straight to the beer stop! (Even a blind pig gets an occasional 
acorn, as we-all say in Caroliner.) </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Porc-a-Orca</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
at the trail turned south on The Laurel Trail. Several checks suggested but failed to deliver, a bushwhack. Further and 
further south they ran. Finally a check was encountered that seemed to have some promise. <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font> turned east into the woods, while the visitor and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> continued to a false mark 
just before Pine Hill Road. But he could only find two marks. Confusion reigned until a horn was heard nearby to the east. 
It was <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. What a choice! They broke through the underbrush to join a smirking <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, beer in hand, on the Meadowbrook Trail. Disgusted, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and the 
visitor turned north, and, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> having marked the checks (so he wouldn’t get lost heading 
back), they checked northwest back on Shippee, and came upon the beer cooler, halfway up the hill.</p>

<p>The beer check was marked by peaceful beer consumption, at least until <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Cum Titty</font> arrived. Then the whining started, and they were forced to drown out the sounds 
with a moderately long Rhubarb session. But there were only twelve beers. You can only nurse them so long. So they 
continued out on the Shippee trail. Getting back to the cars, they realized that the bimbos were missing again. Despite 
the fact that they were reversing their course, AND the hare had left a large arrow marked “Cars”, there was some concern 
that the two DFL’s might be lost. No such luck.</p>

<p>The Circle was joined. Ratings for the run mentioned: no shiggy, no one lost, all trail, flour excess etc. On the 
positive side, though, it could not be denied that there was NO <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and NO <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. Total: <b>+0.69</b>! Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>, despite 
numerous attempts to divert it to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. He’s a slippery bastard! For variety, they tried to 
go for the On On On to the Wood River Inn. There must be some kind of early-hash-warning network in the restaurants in 
this state. They closed just as the group pulled in. So off again to the Big River Inn. The visitors were given 
instruction in Beer Protection Strategies, food was ordered and songs were sung. Any bets on <font 
color="#FF0000">Porc-a-Orca</font>? Smart money says he has to pick someone up at the airport the next few Mondays!</p>
