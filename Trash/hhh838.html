<p><font color="#0000ff">The Run</font>:</p>
<p>The start of the hash was at The Wrentham State Forest. Ever Ready (me) was once again late for the start, although 
they waited the 42 seconds, it was not long enough!!</p>

<p>The trail supposedly went under Rte 495 twice and through the forest, streams and trees. (I only noticed the forest, 
streams and trees)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">KNO, Hilary </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready </font>followed the flour to the BN and 
were puzzled as to where the hashers were? Had they been there and left? Were we hearing voices in the forest (or just in 
our head - who said head...) Then what do we see, Ben, the young old GM running through the stream. Is he the look out 
dog?? Decoy?? Is <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> with him? We all start running the other way (of course) but <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> runs right into us. All are going in different d'erections ... under Rte 495, up Rte 495, up 
the stream, over the stream, through the forest. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> is trying (and why not) to confuse 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, sending him all throughout Wrentham. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was actually 
found at Off Saks at the Wrentham Outlets, shopping for a new horn.</p>

<p>Everyone made it to the beer check and were trying to figure out who this virgin <font color="#FF0000">Hilary</font> 
was. She was too cute to be from Rhode Island. All eyes were upon her and you could see <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
dreams when she proclaimed San Francisco was her hometown and she was ... vegetarian. He tried to take here by her hand 
and lead her away from this group of hashers to have his way with her, but <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>broke the 
mood with his endearing jokes about his clients.</p>

<p>We left the beer check and made it through 100 feet of trees to our cars and the circle. This trail was as short if 
not shorter than an <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready </font>trail! The circle was filled with song and accusations. <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was given the appropriate down downs for short trail and not losing <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and/or <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> was trying to 
protect virgin Hilary from <font color="#FF0000">Async's </font>prowess and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was 
trying to not have the hashit. It didn't work. If the Hashit isn't in the circle, it belongs to <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.</p>

<p>The On In was at Chieftains. We were proudly served by a waitress who did not put up with <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> sh't. He actually looked fearful of her as she lectured him about his misdemeanors. The 
virgin <font color="#FF0000">Hilary</font> was still a bit overwhelmed until <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>(who was 
still sheepishly following her every move) started trying to impress her with his computer skills (can you say joy 
stick?). She placated him by offering him special web site software that she sells. With that promise, she became known 
as <font color="#FF0000">Dream Beaver</font> (she is cousin to<font color="#FF0000"> Eager Beaver</font> and sells Dream 
Weaver).</p>

<p>The On In ended, <font color="#FF0000">Async, Basket</font> &amp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>all tried to 
convince <font color="#FF0000">Dream Beaver </font>of nicer accommodations but she left with her cousin and commented all 
the way home of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS'</font> quiet intellect and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's </font>charming 
personality and appropriate jokes.</p>

<p>The ongoing decision was when to hash for Memorial Day. No decision was ever made. <font color="#FF0000">Dream 
Beaver </font>was absolutely not available at anytime or date although <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>&amp; <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>did try their best. (can you blame her?) When is the next hash? Sunday at 2 or Monday at 3 
or even better, whose decision is it anyway??</p>
