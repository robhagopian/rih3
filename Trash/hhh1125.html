<p><font color="#0000FF">Celebrating:</font> The liberation of the hash from <font color="#FF0000">That’s a Mouthful
</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hare, <font color="#FF0000">That’s A Mouthful</font>, decided to step up to the plate and set his own farewell 
hash, his second trail setting actually. He wanted to make this memorable. It certainly left most with memories. Of shin 
splints, worn soles, blisters, and the smell of asphalt. But what can you do in Pawtuxet Village, anyways? (Try Run # 
<a href="hhh1035.html" target="new">1035</a>.) The virgin streak (now six in a row!) continued, as the hare brought two 
friends, and <font color="#FF0000">Donkey Punch</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Pubic Housing</font> returned, now 
officially RIH3-ers, needing renaming(?). Even <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> made it, wanting to see what 
could be done in this locale (See Run # <a href="hhh1035.html" target="new">1035</a>, again!).</p>

<p>With fifteen hashers present, with the hare’s obvious concern about insufficient beer at the BC, and with the 
ever-present fear that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> or <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> might show up, they were off 
promptly at 6:30. Trail started north from the parking lot of the East View Road Boathouse. It led briefly through the 
small adjacent park, and then turned west onto Post Road. <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font> were FRBs and blew past the true trail which turned right (and 
unnecessarily) onto the paths along the river. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
made the turn and had a brief respite from the grinding pavement. But all too brief! There was a promising check mark at a 
bridge over a small drainage ditch. But it was totally wasted. The trail came back out through sewer pipe central, and 
turned south on Venturi.</p>

<p>The hare had been coaching the back of the pack, so most were already milling about in the condo village across Post 
Road. Trail led to the back, across a fence and into the neighborhood of Presidential streets. <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> knows the sequence of Washington, Adams, Roosevelt, Madison, Cleveland, etc. that trail followed, but the trend 
was south, and was aided and abetted by the hare. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed the hare, along with virgins 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Sean</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Carrie</font>. But on Harrison a check clearly led 
into the Pawtuxet Park Cemetery. In spite of the hare encouraging all to skip this, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
followed true trail. He met <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, apparently following trail backwards. Serves him right! 
And this segment of trail was also to prove the undoing of <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> a few short minutes 
later, as he became irretrievably lost among the dead (better company that the others were dealing with, perhaps).</p>

<p>The main pack was led by Basket, but only because he was off trail and had a loud horn which makes him sound like he 
knows what he’s doing. Pity the fools that follow him in general, but this time, he lucked onto true trail turning east 
on Mayfair, crossing the Narragansett Parkway onto Naushon Rd.  Trail then turned south, skirting the lawn of another 
condo village, and following the coast into the George Salter Grove. The hare tried to keep people out on the road. But 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> continued across the peninsula. They came upon 
the inevitable trail along the shoreline out to the breakwater. This breakwater consists of a berm extending east to a 
long extension with north (man-made) and south (natural) limbs to shelter Pawtuxet cove.  At the “T”, both ways were 
tried. But there were no marks.</p>

<p>Finally, the hare led south. There were a few areas where, if you were exceptionally lazy, you could get your feet wet. 
You couldn’t really call it shiggy. That would be a huge exaggeration! But most welcomed the chance to cool their sore 
and aching feet, still tingling from the endless pavement pounding. The Portuguese fishing crowd looked on in amusement 
at the hashers as they made their way down to the southern tip of the island. The beer was found, and opened. The beer 
was moved a short distance into the water, but the rocks were slippery enough that this did not work out so well, and 
most of the late arrivals didn’t have to make the choice of going in or going dry. All eventually made it, except 
<font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font>, still wandering among the presidents.</p>

<p>Songs were sung, the beer ran out, and as no seconds were going to be had, the BC broke up. The hare gave instructions 
to “take the road back”! Something new and different! More pavement! It was just about a mile back north on Narragansett 
Parkway to the cars. They gradually limped in, and were greeted by <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font>, who had a 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>-like tale of his woes. The circle was held on the docks behind the boathouse.</p>

<p>The run was rated. Pavement, pavement, pavement! No shiggy, to speak of. But: virgin territory (there’s a good reason 
for that!), three bimbos, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, lost hasher, and getting rid of the hare for good! Total: 
<b>+0.69</b>! The backsliders, <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, were punished. 
The virgins were queried, and violated. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font> because she’s single, 
and she has been just dying to find out why <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> has become so attached to the hashit 
and/or its contents. This of course led to her being named. With the incredibly dubious and tenuous reasoning that the 
RIH3 is known for, because of her affiliation with ‘Brown’ University, she was named “<font color="#FF0000">Scatwoman
</font>” Eat your heart out, BH3! At least she proved worthy of her new name, by showing her “ring”! For reasons unclear 
(perhaps because he could not stand to hear Fuwangi botch another verse of “In Mobile”), the hare ended up somersaulting 
into the water. When others began to follow his example, it was time to go.</p>

<p>The On On On was held next door at O’Rourke’s. The behavior was pretty bad, especially in <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing’s</font> case. But perhaps fearing terrorist reprisals, they were not thrown out.  So the evening ended with some 
vinegar and fries in the beer, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> pounding a Bud Light, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> annoying all present. But what else is new?</p>

<p>Addendum: <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> latest effort, inspired by the On On On. Someone needs to get him a 
life. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> wastes his time like this?</p>

<p><font size="4">WALK THE LINE</font><br>
Tune: I Walk The Line, by Johnny Cash<br>
Lyrics by <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font></p>

<p><i>I keep a close watch on this beer of mine. I keep an eye on you at the same time. Because I know you that you keep 
on a tryin’, to turn my beer in to some slime.<br><br>

You think that it is fun to ruin beer. I think that doing that is really queer. I’d rather dink it down in double time, 
because it’s mine, you’ll pay the fine.<br><br>

If you throw fries in, it is a crime. You’ll make the head flat as a fuckin’ dime. Why can’t we all just have a good time, 
Instead of being assholes all the time.<br><br>

I keep my hand over it all the time. If you put vinegar in it will be wine. Then I will kick your ass till you are dyin’. 
You fuckin’ swine; your ass is mine.<br><br>

The OnOn’s are just a bloody mess.  Food on the table, floor and the waitress’. They’re goin’ to throw us out for the 12th 
time. So keep you hands off or walk the line.<br><br>

Stay from my beer because it’s mine.<br>
You keep it up and you’ll be dyin’.<br>
I’ll keep an eye on you this time.</p>
