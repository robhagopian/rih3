Hash Trash Like it or Not<br/><br/>

Alright so to sum up last weeks hash it was pretty much a shit show. The gps mark led most of the hashers past the actual Parking lot, and most of us had to bang a U turn to get to the destination. Others WHO had run there before knew where the parking lot was located. Upon arriving all the hashers were standing in the parking lot just begging to be hit like a bunch of bowling pins, no one could move out of the way for oncoming traffic. <br/><br/>
During chalk talk the Hare was covered in blood, basically bleeding out. He was telling us that there was barbed wire on trail, but not to worry because he marked it out in one spot. However, if you were not on the true trail you did not see that mark and you were on your own for locating the barbed wire. Once I caught up with Rusty and JtT they had been confused about one particular mark an arrow that looked like an X. In my opinion Donkey needs to go back to grammar school to learn how to draw his shapes. <br/><br/>
Continuing down true trail WHO shows up but Oozing. He said he had done the trail backwards and no beer. Then at that moment everyone started to run around like their heads had been chopped off. Meanwhile it was getting darker, a good 45 minutes later finally found the beer stop Mr. Rodgers and I were almost the last ones at the beer stop, however the visitors were the last ones at the beer stop. Ah yes our lovely visitors, from the lone star state of Tes-ass. At the beer stop there were thick pretzels and German beer. Although the very old Mr. Rogers stepped on all the pretzils which was unfortunate to the late cummers. <br/><br/>
At the beer stop we had learned that Basket had missed the beer stop not one, not two, but tree times. Good lord. During circle we questioned our visitors, where Basket questioned them with his favorite question... the question of the year I would say the fucking Elmo question. Yes Basket everyone on planet earth knows the answer to this question. We also had a naming of our visitor from Florida with the name of Haley's Cum-it. <br/><br/>
Pubic housing was MIA in circle because she was doing as a woman should and cooking dinner. We had a lovely spread of  Brats with pretzel bites and more German beer.
