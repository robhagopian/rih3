<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was a cold evening just off Warren Avenue in
the a school car park, with attendees including </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless

and yours truly. The off was on time at 6.30pm with the first circuit being
a circle jerk round a play area with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Deep

having taken the wrong direction further up. </FONT></P>

himself at the back occasionally coming across </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Deep

flying leap of some weeks ago I retraced my steps and found myself at the
back again. The local plod soon sprung into action upon hearing complaints
that someone had strangled a cat which actually was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">blowing his bugle and straying onto private
property. For the local police with nothing better to do, and OJ still
not having shot himself, this complaint was turned into a full scale murder
inquiry with police searching for someone with small strong hands not liking
pussy, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Deep Throat</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was questioned but it was later established that she was rather fond of
her pussy, but other runners were suspected of wanting to F*** pussy, all
other suspects convinced plod they preferred a live pussy, however all
male runners were keen to find this female with small hands in order that
their dicks would appear larger. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
convinced the officers he preferred dogs and sheep and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing

stick his finger in or talk to. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The trail led us to uncharted territory which
took us through what could only be described as high grass field which
had a path cut through it accompanied by some cold wet shiggy, the run
being a very clever A to B ended alongside a road with blue and red lights
still looking for the Rhode Island strangler. It was decided to drive back
to the start in case we were charged with under age drinking. The circle
was formed and before the run could be rated the Hashshit was awarded to

bragging it was too easy and he was at the front too often, a down down
was had with head gear, and was never completed at the on-on. Badges were
given out and each had been personalized except </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s
who could only be given a blank, as his wife had told </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
he was only good for blanks. The run was rated at 5.7 which is the highest
mark all year and deserved the down down. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">was given a down down for confessing to the
murder of the cat but no charges could be brought as the police could not
plant any evidence. The on on was supposed to be a Thai restaurant which
closed once Hopeless inquired if they were open on Mondays, the alternative
was Chinese take away consumed at a local watering hole, grog was Guinness
and the food was OK. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing Syph</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
brought a colleague to observe this interesting group of nutters, but he
consumed his coca cola and departed with a smile, never to be seen again.
Good fun had by all. On-On</FONT></P>
