<p>While &quot;leaders&quot; in the U.S. overexert themselves searching for The Osama One far and wide, RIH3 keeps its 
nasty little secret to itself that he is alive and well, posing as a RIH3 hare in the hills of RI, running about with 
bags of opium or anthrax or whatever, dropping on the ground for all to see, except for hashers who couldn't find the 
damn trail just the same.</p>

<p>This evening's trail began somewhere in Arcadia, abreast of a dwindling but pleasant stream and lots of big rocks. 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>was fashioned up in his desert-like mosquito net hat, of which <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>admired deeply, as well as a fancy new tie-dye shirt from the CCH3 hash, which brought the 
whole group of aging men back a few decades to the good old days. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>arrived early and 
released the dogs, stirring up the dirt around <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover </font>and our visitor from the Orange 
County Hash, <font color="#FF0000">Claytaurus.</font> She was looking for <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, for she had 
his sex toy, a large flag she stole from OCH3. But he was nowhere to be found, something about a bad back or canoe 
building or something. Come to think of it, a lot of people were among the missing...<font color="#FF0000">Eveready 
Beaver </font>and <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> were MIA, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO </font>was getting sunburned 
with his daughters in Mashpee (daughters, ya sure), Hopeless is still hopelessly in hiding, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Snotty </font>went over the pond for good, still bitching and moaning about all the rocks and foliage 
America has yet to pave over and turn into curry houses.</p>

<p>And so, the mighty hash of 4 began alongside the aforementioned stream, bounding along the rocks and mossy trail, two 
bimbos leading the way. It was a blissful sight, until the hares came upon andunknown marking, possibly in 
Urdu...&quot;CB&quot;. &quot;Such marks haven't been seen since 1892&quot; I heard someone mutter. &quot;MOX, that ain't 
no stinkin' Rhode Isylan' MOX!&quot;<font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>exclaimed. The CB, (Check Back, or Curried 
Bastard ?) lead the small pack back to the cars, with the recent arrival <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom,</font> 
smiling broadly having missed the evil spurn trail due to his lateness. The pack was now a full count of 5, and the hare 
led us up a sandy Afghan-type hill to a check and another &quot;CB&quot;.</p>

<p>At this point, Trail Hoover was fed up, began walking up a hill, and STILL missed the mark leading the pack into the 
woods to the right. Finally the trail began looking more like a typically shitty RI trail, with much underbrush, mud 
holes, poison ivy, mossy logs and such. The visitor was taken aback by such foliage having been running in the desert far 
too long, a tear was shed. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>decided to forge his own way blowing a check, and possibly 
himself, ending up 2 miles off and resorting to asking a native where in Tarnation he was.<font color="#FF0000"> Trail 
Hoover </font>led the way after pleading with the Evil One as to where the trail went at a particularly perplexing check. 
Dictaphone obliged mercifully after a sexual favor, and off went the massive pack of 3 hounds bounding down the trail that 
would take them through much mud, circle jerks, back tracking and lovely virgin trail to the Beer Check.</p>

<p><font color="#FF000">Basket</font> and his bugle was no where to be found at the lovely, swampy, insect infested pile 
of logs where the beer was hidden. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, where the hell was <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo?</font> Last we heard he took off on his 2 wheeled machine heading for freedom in the other 
direction. The stagnant swamp by the beer check pleaded with me to swim in its musky waters, but I was able to tear 
myself away from thoughts of swimming naked to continue on down the trail with the <font color="#FF0000">Claytaurus,</font> <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
and the Hippie to the start, the same trail we came in on and lost <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font></p>

<p>To our surprise, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>and his new fangled hip and crutches were at the beginning to 
greet us (crutches are something of a luxury in Afghanistan the dark-skinned foreigner hare told us).  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and the dogs magically appeared down a CB trail, almost happy to see us having been lost 
for so long with 3 dogs.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> somehow made his way to the start as well, actually I'm not 
sure he ever left, and so the singing began with Tinker in the lead, and not just any songs, but non-German songs!!! 
Claytarus brought out <font color="#FF0000">Async's</font> sex toy (which was promptly hidden for some time up <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker's</font> ass) and the hare was made to drink for such abusive behavior as making Curry Bastard 
&quot;MOX&quot;, and setting trail after we had already passed the checks. The Hashit was almost relinquished to the 
visitor for some unknown reason, but <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was most rewarding of the socko'shit, since he 
didn't even make it to the beer check. Ben, the alcoholic that he is, whined like his owner for beer and got little the 
entire circle, as did his owner. All in all, a -0.69 was given for the shitty trail, and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was left at the scene 
changing into various layers of sub-zero degree tested undergarments.</p>

<p>The group convened at Mike's, a funny little dive located in strip mall, Rhode Island style. The food was fine and the 
beer wasn't bad either. Classic 70's rock blared from the speakers, and even <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> attempts 
to silence the stuff with his evil chants and Muslim call to prayer were squashed by <font color="#FF0000">Tinker
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover's</font> rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas cover of Neil Diamond 
covering Purple Haze. <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Oozing, WIPOS </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Claytaurus</font> could 
only stare in awe and wonderment, was it the hippie tie-dye shirt that brought this on?</p>

<p>In the parking lot, <font color="#FF0000">Async's</font> sex toy, having been recovered from <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker's</font> ass, was gracefully given to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for a signing, never 
to be seen by OCH3 again. The visitor semi-promised to be at next week's run to retrieve the flag...we shall see, we 
shall see.</p>

<p>Note: RIH3 has been trying to name <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> a RIH name, punishment for her showing 
up almost every week for 4 weeks. I do recall the name, &quot;Summer's Eve&quot;, or was is &quot;Summer's Ease&quot;? 
Maybe this will get ironed out at the next hash.</p>
