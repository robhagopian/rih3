<font SIZE="2">
<p><font face="Arial">It was a dark and stormy night. Rain was pouring in the 
cold mists of southern RI. Traffic was at a standstill on I95. The Exeter police 
were on high alert, having heard rumors of an impending night raid across the 
border from Connecticut. In spite of this, the intrepid men, women and mad dogs 
of the RIH3 made their various ways to an isolated corner of the Arcadia 
Management Area to see if the Nutmeg boys could hash with the best. The hare,
<font color="#FF0000">Surfin' Compusex</font>, made sure to meet all the 
stringent requirements of the RIH3 by giving directions that were confused at 
best; renaming a few roads, and going into unnecessary detail at certain points. 
In spite of this, one by one the hashers arrived and were directed by mysterious 
strangers off Nooseneck Hill Road to a parking area at a gate on the Tefft Hill 
Trail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The hares and virgins from Connecticut were first to 
arrive, followed by the visitor and backslider <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font>, 
from Dublin, and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> from Barrington.
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> soon 
followed. While they were sampling a beer from the back of the hare's truck, one 
of the virgins (<font color="#FF0000">Just Matt</font>, I believe) who had been 
directing traffic at the turn off rolled up and said that he had mistakenly 
tried to invite the local DEM Enforcement Officer. The officer apprised of the 
evenings plans, stated that this was illegal and the hashers couldn't proceed 
unless they were prepared to either: catch some fish, kill some raccoons, or 
play dueling banjos while sexually assaulting the virgins. [<font color="#FF0000">Just 
Matt</font> left that part out of his story.] It was decided to play stupid if 
caught (not much of an acting challenge for this bunch!). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The hares donned white paper suits hoping if caught to 
convince the DEM man that they were the Exeter HazMat team disposing of the 
anthrax that had been sighted in these woods. They set off to lay the trail, 
while the rest gave nervous glances down the road during the fifteen minute head 
start. Headlights were seen coming towards the parking area. The group all ran 
behind the trucks, doused their lights and crouched, holding their hands in 
front of their eyes, stifling giggles like a group of preadolescent school girls 
hiding from the headmistress. But it was <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. 
Minutes later, this pitiful scene was repeated again for <font color="#FF0000">
EverReady</font>. Then again, for <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. It was 
pathetic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In disgust, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and the 
management team were off at maximum speed (a pace equivalent to an arthritic 
snail). The rest waited for the requisite time hiding, as much from
<font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> as the DEM man, and then set off. 
The trail led east with a couple of easily dispatched zigzag checks moving 
slightly north crossing over the ambitiously named &quot;Roaring Brook&quot; and its 
branches several times. It was discovered that the checks were represented by 
three dots of flour. Not knowing this, several of the RIH3 regulars got caught 
running in very tight circles around these marks and had to be forcibly pulled 
back on trail by the visitors in order to continue. <font color="#FF0000">Polly
</font>decided to show why he is a legend in the hashing world, and commenced 
the most frequent, graceful, and ludicrous series of falls that it has ever been 
your scribe's pleasure to witness. Not wanting to be shown up,
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> (no slouch when it comes to falling like an 
idiot) started to trip over rocks and vines, and the FRB's could hear the loud 
crashes and thuds followed by shouted obscenities, from miles ahead. [Speaking 
of FRB's, this hash made hash history, as: a) <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi
</font>was a FRB throughout the run to the beer check, b) <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> claimed to have caught the live hare, and c) <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> actually made it to the beer check!]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The rain which had been significant before the start, was 
dying down and the temperature rose substantially. Unfortunately, all had 
dressed as if they were attending the <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> family 
reunion, and became overheated rapidly (especially <font color="#FF0000">
EverReady</font> who was distinctly flushed and tousled at the beer check and 
tried to slander <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> when we all know who SHE 
wants for GM, the crafty minx!). As they headed northeast, marks became toilet 
paper, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was inspired to add to the trail 
with a few special movements of his own so to speak. As he remained in front, 
this resulted in substantial confusion for those who followed until they 
realized that the trail was partly marked in USED toilet paper. Because of the 
heat, the cohare began to set trail with parts of his white suit, and these led 
to a gate and the beer check which was found back on the Tefft Hill trail, under 
the southbound lanes of I 95. The beer was found to consist of Sam Adams 
varietals and a strange yellow liquid of unusual and unappealing taste and odor. 
On the cans(!) of this foul brew was the astounding, unfounded slogan: &quot;King of 
Beers&quot;! Most of the group used this to clean their sneakers. Even Jake wouldn't 
risk life and limb by drinking it. A few songs were sung and the hare was off 
again. After waiting about ten minutes, the run resumed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">They split into two groups by the gate when it became 
clear that no marks were used. One group consisting of <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo, Basket, Just Matt, Just Brett</font> and a few others chose the simple 
expedient of backtracking for a while. They found some TP and made appropriate 
use of it, ensuring that the stragglers would get lost. The rest fanned out.
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> took the high route onto Tefft Hill while
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS, Dr WHO, EverReady</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Polly</font> (not wanting to exert themselves by going uphill) formed a wide 
south facing arc searching for signs of humanity. They headed southwest along 
the slopes of Tefft Hill looking for flour, TP or even a path. Eventually, a 
trail marked with yellow blazes was found and after about one-quarter of a mile, 
flour was spotted near the crossing of the yellow trail and RI's North-South 
Trail. From this point the trail was straight south west, with numerous dips 
filled with very satisfying puddles and mud every few yards. Finally, the 
runners came out in small groups onto Old Nooseneck road finally, turned north 
and headed to the down down area at a turn-off to the left near Browning Mill 
Pond.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The ceremony was joined and the hares called to account. 
Ratings were generally favorable because of the weather: <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> gave 12+F, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> claimed that some 
moisture had actually reached through to his skin, <font color="#FF0000">Async
</font>loved the shiggy, <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> stated he enjoyed 
the rocks and tree roots, the virgins thought it wasn't athletic enough,
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decried the lack of German anthems,
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> loved the beer at the beer check,
<font color="#FF0000">Pound Puppy</font> thought it was too short, and
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> got mired up in mathematical calculations. 
The end result: a +0.69. The hares sang two lines from the refrain of &quot;The Hairs 
on Her Dickey Di Do&quot; and got lost, requiring the services of the RIH3 Festival 
Choir to flesh out the rendition of this classic. Next: virgins in the circle.
<font color="#FF0000">Just Brett</font> had no intelligible answer to any of his 
three questions although GM Jake appeared to understand him completely. Just 
Matt got his name, admitted to perversions with <font color="#FF0000">Compusex</font>, 
and, will coaching from <font color="#FF0000">Just Brett</font> who finally 
recovered his voice, knew that the square-root of 69 was &quot;Ate-something&quot;. The 
down downs lasted longer than the run as <font color="#FF0000">Just Brett</font> 
appeared to have a swallowing disorder. Then, they ad-libbed a song using the 
word &quot;Beer&quot;, which was a great success. Visitors in the circle: Neither had a 
reasonable explanation for why they had chosen to run with the RIH3 so there was 
little discussion. <font color="#FF0000">Pound Puppy</font> tried to correct the 
RIH3 protocol, provoking howls of derisive laughter. <font color="#FF0000">Polly
</font>sang &quot;I'm a Wanker&quot; with great aplomb.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Hashit in the circle. But where was the hashit?
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was found hiding in the bushes where, 
inspired by the visitor's song he had gone off for a bit of a wank. Not wanting 
to inconvenience him, the circle was moved around him in the thorns. Nominations 
included all of the regulars but <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was 
despondent at having lost the hashit the previous week, and demanded it back, 
provoking an open power struggle between the two for the dishonor. Finally, the 
circle moved back into the open, and had closing religion. The on on on was to 
be back at Mark's (a.k.a. Mike's, Mac's, Mork's) off exit 6(6A) in the hope that
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> could hook back up with
<font color="#FF0000">Just Valerie</font> from Run #813.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For the first time on record, all the runners made it to 
the restaurant.<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> tried to protect his beer 
from malt vinegarization by arranging the tables into an impenetrable barrier 
protecting himself and EverReady from all others (and there were some strange 
goings on underneath the table, I can tell you!). <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
again came close to receiving a reprimand from the RIH3 Medical squad by 
ordering the Grilled Vegetable Plate, ignoring the possibility of dangerously 
lowering his alcohol-negating cholesterol levels. <font color="#FF0000">Pound 
Puppy</font> took it upon himself, with the virgins assisting, to try to recruit 
some patrons at a neighboring table to future RIH3 events. Lisa the waitress 
denied knowing where <font color="#FF0000">Just Valerie</font> might be. With 
incomprehensible decorum: no food fights, no vinegar in the beer, and no songs, 
the evening came to a mellow close. The Connecticut Connection is invited to set 
trail for the RIH3 anytime, although they will of course be required to take the 
mandatory 6 hour &quot;Bondo Beer Appreciation and Safety Course&quot; before they will be 
allowed to import anymore of the &quot;Beer that made Milwaukee Famous&quot; (And the RIH3 
Nauseous) onto hash trails.</font></p>
