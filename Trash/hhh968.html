<p><font color="#008000">Run #968</font>, October 25, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; SESYB</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Co-Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing SD</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Blackstone Bikeway Parking Lot, Rt 116, Lincoln</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 40’s, Cloudy.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Tinker, Dr WHO, Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, Fuwangi Boner, Just Drew, 
Just Josh, Ben, Seamus. Visitors: Finger Lickin’ Good (Ottowa H3), Thunder-Something (Flagstaff H3).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The group gathered at the site of a <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>hash from the spring, showing the level 
of effort that had been put into this run by the hares. Not even six months ago! And we wonder why only those with 
Alzheimer’s show up each week! As they arrived, it was noted that the circle from the previous week had not been 
completed, courtesy of the Woonsocket PD. Therefore when <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> arrived, a closing 
circle was formed, much confusing the visitors. Last week’s run was rated: multiple arrests, but no shootings, and 
no strip searches, miles of pavement. Luckily for <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket’s</font> behaviour was enough to make it “Run of the (previous) Week”! Total: 6.9! Hashit was a formality. 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived during the closing religion, and was informed of this. He protested, 
but as usual was ignored. Then they all set off on trail.</p>

<p>Trail led down the slope to the Bike path. It crossed onto the canal towpath northward and was followed by all, 
except those who had been suckered in this same section during <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi’s</font> run. So the 
visitors, <font color="#FF0000">the Just boys</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>ran with the hare out 
to the end of this peninsula, and crossed back over to climb a cliff back to the path along the river. <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi, WHO, Tinker,</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>avoided this and took the high 
road, missing the moist territory on the lower path.</p>

<p>The two groups proceeded separately, high <font color="#FF0000">(Fuwangi) </font>and low <font color="#FF0000">
(Basket)</font> paralleling each other and the river, northwest under the 295 bridge. A check brought them all back 
together in confusion halfway up the hill.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> made his usual break from conformity 
at this point, and headed through some backyards out to Albion Road.  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> disappeared altogether. But the co-hare called the rest back down to the banks of the 
river.&nbsp; Eventually, they came to a water-crossing at a shallow inlet off the main river. The hare promised: 
“It’s only up to the ankles!” (Maybe she meant to say “cockles”, because most of the boys soon found their secondary 
sexual characteristics beating a hasty retreat from the groin-high ice-cold water.) But Finger-Lickin’ Good enjoyed 
getting wet in a different way.</p>

<p>The trail then passed along an overgrown trail/deer path to emerge on the road at Albion Bridge. A check mark 
was encountered. The SCB’s and early arrivals successfully found the trail across the river and turning back south 
east on the bike path. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> however, turned left 
up a falsie. When they returned to the check, police lights were seen across the bridge. A flashback to last week 
had <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> in a cold sweat; swearing and stomping his feet. He vowed: “they’re not 
gonna get me this time!” It took the hare considerable effort to convince <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000"> Fuwangi</font> that the police were at a traffic accident further up the road, and that they 
could safely follow the marks back into the woods.</p>

<p>They were shepherded by the hare briefly on the bike path, then on to bushwhacking east. They crossed Albion Road. 
They entered some woods for a remarkably pointless loop, then crossed back west to a stream. Trail led through the 
stream. Well, to be more precise, in the stream. Some tried to keep their feet dry, and bushwhacked along the banks 
following the splashing sounds and obscenities from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, Fuwangi</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>. But eventually, they came to a spillway tunnel under the RR tracks. Above, a fence along 
the tracks forced the entire group to get shiggy, and wade under. <font color="#FF0000">The Just boys</font> indulged 
in considerable whining at this point, worrying about submerged dead bodies or water rats or something. The rest were 
subdued with reverent admiration. But only briefly.</p>

<p>Trail continued parallel to the river, on and off the bike path. Just as the level of complaining began to peak, 
they reached the BC, under the 295 bridge. Beer was opened, and a few songs were sung.  <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were still missing. This improved everyone’s mood, so a pleasant 
and festive BC was enjoyed by all. At an appropriate time, they packed up and continued on trail southeast.</p>

<p>They hadn’t gone far when, like two turds resurfacing after an incomplete flush, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> reappeared. They had backtracked from the cars to a scenic overlook by a 
sluiceway, where they had seen trail marks and decided to wait for the main group. An impromptu second BC was set up. 
Stories were shared, excuses made. Most were glum. But with the talent for overcoming adversity that is the hallmark 
of an RIH3-er, they were soon back on trail. This briefly led through an old industrial area and then across the new 
bike path bridge under 116, and back to the cars.</p>

<p>The circle was held under the 116 bridge where fluted columns and reverberant acoustics led to a real accentuation 
of the harmonizing ability of the group. That is to say, it made it sound like a burlap bag full of cats being swatted 
in an echo chamber. Ratings for the run: Out-and-back with few checks of note, good weather and none lost. This was 
balanced by an excellent tunnel, some good shiggy, temporary loss of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, and considerable whining. Total: 6.9! Hashit: to <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> 
of course, for attempting to refuse it for the preceding week, and for short-cutting just to miss shiggy. The On On On 
was at Tucks, and most made it there safely. It was a quiet group, however, and there should be no difficulty going 
there again in the future. Unfortunately.</p>
