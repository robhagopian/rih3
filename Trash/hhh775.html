<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Hard-core group of low-lifers gathered in the
parking lot of the Burrillville Middle School, their numbers decimated by the
U.S. Navy's insistence upon defending our shores from the communist menace. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
was substitute hare, doing his part in the aftermath of <font color="#FF0000">Little
Neck's </font>near tragic wanking injury, and ignoring the fact that St.
Patrick's day was well past, (as well as the fact that March 19 is St. Joseph's
Day, and Adolph Eichmann's birthday) <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided
to set trail with green shamrocks. Except he used blue. After a toast with
Jameson's, the pack was off.<br>
<br>
As the pack left the parking lot, a stranger approached and said &quot;What are
you guys doing?&quot; &quot;Taking a short run&quot; was the reply. The
stranger, <font color="#FF0000">Just Gary</font>, noted that he had been
planning to run around the school track, so he was invited to join us for our
little sojourn in the woods. The poor sod obviously had as few brains as the
rest of the crew, and joined in.<br>
<br>
The trail began across the street, where it initially paralleled Rt 102 heading
west, but soon struck off in a more southerly route. It was not long before
large quantities of liquefying snow, mud, and open water were encountered. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>,
new stick in hand (along with other portions of his anatomy, when he thought no
one was looking) led for much of the early going, mostly by the simple expedient
of choosing the trail opposite to the one chosen by <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO</font>, who again demonstrated that given a 50:50 chance, he could choose
the wrong path 90% of the time. <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> spent time
explaining what was going on to our incidental virgin, who remarked: &quot;You
guys do this every week?!&quot; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> kept his
feet dry for a suspiciously long time, almost provoking a nomination for the
Hashit. He realized this just in time, and went for a wade in the mud.<br>
<br>
The trail became wetter and wetter, making up for the lousy weather. First
uphill into snow drifts. Then down into a stream. Rather boring after a while.
However, the temperature/moisture combination was ideal for trench foot, which
was experienced by all except the erstwhile virgin, who had worn hiking boots.
&quot;You guys do this every week?!&quot; he marveled. It also appeared that <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>was economizing on his colored shamrocks: he could not have laid more
than seven ounces of hash on the whole trail. But his footprints gave the trail
away. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo,</font> after making snow angels along the
trail in several spots, grew bored, and wanked off into the woods, following
what he thought was a wood nymph, but merely turned out to be a horny coyote. He
missed the beer stop but added a new sexual experience to his already dissipated
existence.<br>
<br>
Beer was found and used to resuscitate our inexplicable virgin, who was near
respiratory arrest, although he had dry feet. &quot;You guys really do this
every week?!&quot; he mused. A few songs were sung, demonstrating to our
ineluctable virgin that none of the hashers parents has wasted money on singing
lessons, and then the pack was off again, for the short remaining distance to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
abode (&quot;What was that: about seven miles?&quot; asked the inconceivable
virgin.)<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> long suffering wife had tried to lock the
door, but <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had picked the lock using a torn
fingernail and a pubic hair, and so the bedraggled pack was greeted by the sight
of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> consuming beer by the fire. The circle was
joined, the hare chastised with a 5F score from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
and a &quot;Great Run&quot; and &quot;You guys honestly do this every
week?!!&quot; from the ineffable virgin. Songs were sung, and the hashit
returned from <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> to its rightful owner: <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
who, in his shame, tried to burn it. This being unsuccessful, he later tried
some bathroom remodeling using the hashit, showing carpentry skills on a par
with his singing voice. The improbable virgin called his wife over the sounds of
this singing: what he told her is unknown, although he was overheard to mention
both &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;Space aliens&quot; during his conversation.
Corned beef and cabbage were provided and the evening ended on a mellow note
when it became clear that <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was not planning
to expose himself.<br>
