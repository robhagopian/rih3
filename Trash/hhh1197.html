the parking lot next to the library, they had the usual start, heading north. 
Without much difficulty, trail was found past Nine Men’s Misery, crossing the 
now dry stream continuing towards the water tower. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> followed his own imaginary trail on his own and was 
soon lost. Unaccountably, <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> was not short 
cutting, and kept to the trail! <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> tried the water 
tower path briefly, but with no marks decided to head for the cliffs over the 
quarry, where he encountered the pack. The rest of the pack circled southwest 
and south. They found an unnecessary loop east, south and west. They also found 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. And finally, they found the beer check. On 
the cliffs over the quarry. Surprise.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">After the beer 
was finished, and the songs sung (for the 1197<SUP>th</SUP> time) they headed 
back. Trail led <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>east, and downhill. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> decided to ignore the trail and took the shortest 
route to the cars. Only to find that the hare had set the circle at the west end 
of the fields. He rejoined the group just before the long note. The run was 
rated. No virgin territory, recycled beer check, no shiggy, and only one bimbo. 
Only the absence of <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, and the lack of pavement 
saved it from being a total loss. Total: -6.9. For reasons lost in the mists of 
memory, it was decided to try to rename <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey</FONT> <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Punch Two: Naked Polar Bears F**king In The Snow</FONT>. I don’t 
think so! Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> for being the only one 
to try shortcutting. On On On was at Tucks. That’s about 
it.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
