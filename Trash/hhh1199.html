chilly, but clear and bright for the start of yet another hash from the Swansea 
Town Offices. Trail led out north and turned immediately east behind the 
cemetery. A goodly crowd was present, and no one was fooled by the first major 
check, which turned the pack on trail northeast on a fairly long bushwhack 
through a swampy area. Some deer trails helped a bit, but it basically was mud 
and briars until they came out to the powerlines, heading 
northwest.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The powerlines 
had the pack confused for a while, but true trail was finally found heading back 
into the woods, this time on trails. Two good checks near the northernmost 
“pudding” rock had the pack scattered. But finally <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT> found 
true trail heading back south. The beer check was found atop the tallest of the 
rocks, and the hare brought up the beer with a minimum of fuss. It was just in 
time for sunset. A lovely overlook. Beer,and nuts. Two lovely bimbos, a light 
sweat glistening between their breasts. Ah, it was fine! But <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> together can 
ruin just about anything, so after a few dozen songs, they were 
off..<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

was straightforward, flashlights on, straight south with only a few checks to 
confuse the FRB’s. They circled next to the cemetery. Ratings: no pavement, some 
shiggy, a beautiful beer check and two quality bimbos. Total:+6.9! <FONT

says so, that’s why! The On On On was at Jillians Sports Pub in Somerset. First
