<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3">“<i>Call me Ishmael. Some weeks ago--never mind how long 
precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to 
interest me in Glendale, I thought I would hash about a little and see the 
watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and 
regulating the circulation.</i> W<i>henever I find myself growing grim about the 
mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find 
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear 
of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand 
of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately 
stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off - then, I 
account it high time to get to a hash as soon as I can. This is my substitute 
for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his 
sword; I quietly take to the trail. There is nothing surprising in this. If they 
but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very 
nearly the same feelings towards hashing with me.”</i></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The directions for this run appeared on the website 
with almost no time to spare. In fact, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had to 
prod the recalcitrant hares by suggesting that the hashers forego the usual 
landmarks for Colt State Park (the notable bronze statues of Whales (Lions, 
Bulls?)) and meet at the Joggers parking lot off Poppasquash road.
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Dr WHO, Swallows My Pride, Oozing</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> initially joined the hares
<font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> and <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>. 
Instructions were given and promptly at 6:30 they were off.</p>

<p>Trail led briefly north into the park on the road. 
It then rapidly disintegrated. At the first check, scant flour led across a 
field into some contrived shrubberies, then back to Poppasquash road right next 
to the cars. It always pays to wait a bit at the start. Some crossed the road 
and tried to go for a swim in Bristol harbor. Perhaps they assumed (incorrectly) 
that the hares wouldn’t resort to pavement this early. Or perhaps they were 
attracted by the distant sounds of strange whistles, clicks, and scream-like 
pulses heard at the shoreline. Regardless, the true trail was eventually found 
by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, leading south onto Poppasquash Neck. At 
least two unmistakable traces of flour were found on trail along with a strange, 
lemony scent and some less obvious Whale-spoor.</p>

<p>As <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> caught up, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
was nowhere to be found. Catching a glimpse of what he thought might be a 
falcate dorsal fin, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had turned into the Bristol 
Yacht club. But it was only a fluke.&nbsp; At the same time <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> turned back into the park proper, ignoring the absence of flour 
completely and lobtailing for the open water of Narragansett Bay. The rest of 
the transient pod continued on to the next check, at the access road to 
Coggeshall Farms.</p>

<p>True trail in fact led west towards the farm. On the 
road, the leader <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> passed fields with strange 
and huge shadows moving majestically in the night. At first he thought that they 
were some sort of weird landbound cetacean creatures. But he soon recognized 
them as the models for the statues of Whales (lions, bulls) at the entrance to 
Colt State Park. He encountered the hare at a check marked “LC”. This stood for 
an Italian liqueur called Limonciello.&nbsp; As <font color="#FF0000">SMP, SESYB</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> joined them, they passed around the 
sickly sweet lemon/vodka/sugar mixture. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
thought the stuff was fine, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> felt it going to 
his head, and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> privately thought it tasted 
like lemon-flavored ambergris left too long at room temperature.
<font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> also arrived and they waited for Bondo. They 
were waiting for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>! Suddenly realizing what 
they were doing, they hastily plunged on with a shudder. They crossed northeast 
through a stand of phragmites onto the Mill Gut.</p>

<p>The hares stayed back and said they would save some 
of the strange liqueur for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (an apt revenge 
indeed for his &quot;Honey Ale&quot; experiments). <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> now 
lemony-fresh, led through this salt marsh closely followed by
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB, Dr WHO </font>and <font color="#FF0000">SMP</font>. 
The hashers spread over the marsh in a search pattern, noting a continued flour 
shortage and lemon excess. But there was basically only one way to go. So they 
went. The rare flour marks blended into imperceptibility amidst the marsh grass 
and Whale excrement. Finally, trail was found leading to a salt-water channel 
with a tidal gate crossing the deepest part (possibly designed to prevent access 
by Killer Whales into Colt State Park).</p>

<p>An overturned sign had been wedged at the near post 
of this gate to aid the hashers. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>soon found 
out that this misguided flotation device would not support his weight. He went 
in to his knees. He recovered quickly, and crawled over the metal gate, followed 
with little fuss, but immense lack of grace, by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>.
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> negotiated the obstacle without incident.
<font color="#FF0000">SMP </font>however, came to the gate and was nonplussed. 
It required considerable encouragement to get her across, and after breaching 
several times she demonstrated a vocabulary of a much wider and earthier range 
than previously she had been thought capable of. [Her descriptions of the 
personal characteristics of the hares was worthy of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo 
Jovi</font> and cannot be reproduced here for legal reasons.]</p>

<p>The hares in the meantime had turned back towards 
the start in search of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. They encountered
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and three visitors from the brachypelagic 
branch of the Armed Forces at Newport. These three, <font color="#FF0000">
Cockabooboo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Nuclear BoJob</font>, and
<font color="#FF0000">Just Matt </font>had all hashed in other areas of the 
world. They came this night with the common misconception that they would be met 
with a trail marked with flour. In fact, the entire evening would pass, and the 
only flour they would see would be on the Whale-burger buns at the restaurant 
later that evening. The hares directed them though, and they made it as far as 
the first moist patch in the salt marsh. This was too much for these manly Navy 
types, so<font color="#FF0000"> WIPOS</font> suggested they follow
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> example. [Note for new RIH3 hashers: 
following <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> example can lead to dangerous and 
even life-threatening consequences. Remember the time <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> told poor Ahab: &quot;I always go after the white ones, it's so much 
easier.&quot; But I digress.] They turned back to the park to wander around 
aimlessly.</p>

<p>The four marsh rats continued to make slow progress 
up the flats, their excitement at the rare sighting of flour outweighed by the 
frequent false steps up to the waist into foul smelling quicksand. Finally, a 
mark led east out of the muck. They emerged into the park, picking soft-shelled 
clams out of their socks, and crabs and other benthic feeders out of their 
underwear. But the flour shortage persisted. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>
was hanging out by the men’s room at a nearby picnic area. He could smell the 
group before he could see them, a bizarre combination of lemon and swamp gas 
(and perhaps other varieties) wafting pungently on the brisk southwesterly 
breeze. He called out “On On!” as if he were on trail even though he had not 
seen flour (or a Whale) for at least three weeks. They regrouped near the park 
entrance booths and discovered the hares setting a fire at the BC. This was just 
off the road in woods that provided no shelter from either the winds or curious 
eyes (although perfectly safe from Whale attacks).</p>

<p>The beer was broached and the occasional car seen at 
the entrance was happily ignored as the hashers told their tales of personal 
prowess on the run and waited for the latecomers (and Whales) to arrive.
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS, Cockabooboo, Nuclear BeauJob</font>, and
<font color="#FF0000">Just Matt</font>, through a process of echolocation and 
blind luck came into olfactory range of the group and followed their noses to 
join the crowd. Introductions were made. Beer was consumed and
<font color="#FF0000">KNO </font>soon went off with a box of empties to get more 
beer. He was surprised in the woods by a menacing, shadowy figure with a 
blindingly bright torch. This was not a Whale at all. This was a State Trooper; 
one of Rhode Island’s finest on patrol checking out a report of adolescent 
hooligans carousing in the park. <font color="#FF0000">KNO </font>claimed at 
first that the group was a “Save the Whales” bay cleanup that had gone late. The 
astute trooper did not buy this tale. It looked as if all was lost!</p>

<p>Fortunately, the policeman reached the fire and with 
one look at the aged and mature group, he was at least partly relaxed. Singling 
out the most suspicious member of the party, he sniffed <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing’s</font> breath. As far as he could tell, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
had only been drinking lemon-scented furniture cleaner. Hence he was not the 
menace to society that at first he appeared. A brief chorus of “Anchors Awhale!” 
from the naval visitors had the officer fully convinced, and he amiably assisted 
in the banking of the fire. He then walked with the hashers back to the on-in 
trail. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>noted how reasonable the trooper was. 
He thus spent some time trying to recruit him to the hash. [<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
obviously did not realize that most hashes fall within State Police 
jurisdiction. When and if the trooper participated, he would probably be 
duty-bound to arrest himself and any Whales involved at the end of the run. But I digress.]</p>

<p>After a brief jog south then east the hashers came 
together in the parking area. It was agreed that it was not worth risking the 
recently established good-relations with the State Police by chugging beer and 
singing “Has Anybody Seen My Whale?” in the parking lot. So after changing 
clothes, they packed up and headed to Warren to circle up in the Tinker’s Nest. 
Only <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> demurred and headed for home to try and 
feed some razor blades to his dog Ben.</p>

<p>At Tinker’s, the management readily agreed to allow 
the use of the main stage for the circle after it was explained that it was in 
fact a religious ceremony, and involved entertaining singing, possibly including 
ancient Whaling songs. With the hares in the circle, ratings and comments were 
given: too short, not enough shiggy, weather too good. All scored it –6.9. 
Unfortunately, this resulted in the special case ruling that if any hash 
provokes this much whining, it is entitled to an automatic total of +69!</p>

<p>Hashit was next. <font color="#FF0000">Swallows My 
Pride</font> was the early favorite for whining on the website and then denying 
it. But the visitor <font color="#FF0000">Cockabooboo</font> found a flyer 
advertising the singing group “No Shamus”. [It appeared that
<font color="#FF0000">Cockabooboo’s</font> job in the Navy involves the 
top-secret training of Bottlenose Dolphins and Killer Whales to retrieve secrets 
from America’s enemies. His specialty suffered a great loss of funding when it 
was shown that Orcas were likely to die after no more than 30-40 meters of 
awkward travel on the desert road to Baghdad. And they aren't exactly 
inconspicuous. <font color="#FF0000">Cockabooboo</font> thus bears a special 
grudge against these moderately inoffensive creatures.] He was inordinately and 
vocally amused by what he took as a prohibition against Odontoceti in a bar. A 
confused discussion about Killer Whales, St. Bernard puppies, Gaelic spelling 
and other related topics grew heated. The hashit was transferred to
<font color="#FF0000">Cockabooboo</font>. It was then noted that
<font color="#FF0000">Swallows My Pride</font> had changed shoes after the hash.
<font color="#FF0000">Nuclear BeauJob</font> pointed out that she appeared to be 
wearing new shoes! She compounded the offense with more denial, so beer was 
served to all in these fragrant vessels.</p>

<p>Finally, they swung low, and moved on to food. A 
special of $1 Cheeseburgers (guaranteed less than 10% whale meat), wings, and 
grilled cheese was available, and the hash ate well and by evening's end almost 
all had washed away the last traces of lemon from their palates. Unusual music 
choices from the jukebox by <font color="#FF0000">Just Matt</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Swallows My Pride</font> filled the air. Doesn't Barry 
Manilow constitute a hashit offence? At any rate, a fine time was had by all, 
with a lovely run, no <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, the loss of<font color="#FF0000"> 
Bondo</font> afterwards, and not one whale-related injury. It doesn't get any 
better than that.</p>
