</font><font SIZE="2"><font face="Arial">The run began in the Park &amp; Ride in 
Tiverton, RI with rumors abounding about visitors from Baahston...our favorite 
bimbo, <font color="#FF0000">Deep Throat</font> had joined forces with
<font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready Smelly Beaver 69</font> in a quest to finally 
have more than 4 hashers show up in the middle of the winter at a RIH3 hash. It 
worked. Three car loads arrived with p** smoking, cigarette smoking, budweiser 
drinking hashers from &quot;the big city&quot;. They had pre-lubed in Bristol and Lil' 
Bear to get &quot;in the mood&quot; for real Rhode Island trail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The temperature was dropping and the layers were being 
applied by all that were going to hash...<font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> 
started with the instructions...&quot;flour marks through the woods he stated, listen 
for Route 24 and you know you are close to beer.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The hashers were off, down a dirt road, veering right 
towards the highway, under the overpass, through the swamps getting wetter and 
wetter, cold and damp but the RI hashers were so excited to finally have others 
to talk to and about, they were all smiles. What a picture to finally have more 
than <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready </font>smiling on this &quot;lovely run&quot;. False 
trails through the smelly water, pricker bushes galore, true Rhode Island red 
markes on all our legs, it was glorious or shitty however you want to describe 
it. When what do we all realize (or most of us), we were circle jerked, muddied 
shoes, scraped faces and not a beer to be found...the crowd was getting louder, 
whistles and horns, dogs barking and in the forest you could hear the yells of 
the hashers &quot;<font color="#FF0000">One Drunk, Flushy</font> ... r u??&quot; Some 
hashers were showing concern for <font color="#FF0000">ODW </font>and
<font color="#FF0000">Flushy</font>, lost in the prickers without suitable 
flashlights, but at least they had flasks...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Olympic Events were accomplished with pride by the 
RIH3, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>showed complete form in the &quot;peeing 
from the bunker&quot; contest, Basket won a medal for something olympic, I lost count 
by all the debris in my eyes by the time I made it to the beer check.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The beer check was found by all,(even ODW and Flushy, who 
were both out of breath and liquored up when they arrived).
<font color="#FF0000">Dr Who, Oozing, Basket</font> and others serenaded the 
forest with the <font color="#FF0000">wonderful</font> hash tribute songs. Some 
German songs began when everyone decided it was time to turn back...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We were told to follow the marks back (I don't know, I 
didn't notice many marks), but plenty of briar patches. On on, on on through 
these tick infested, pricker infested woods, tree branches cracked,
<font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> falling only to be caught by
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> - <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was 
smiling especially bright after &quot;catching&quot; <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> 
in the rear! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The only way I found my way back to the Park &amp; Ride was by 
the full moon <font color="#FF0000">Stuff Me</font> was shining at the end of 
the dirt road (thank you <font color="#FF0000">Stuff Me</font>)...The circle was 
formed, the run was given a -6.9, the hare was given a down down for cutting up
<font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom's</font> legs and knees, (How did his 
knees get so red??). The visit from the Tiverton police was fruitful since they 
jotted down <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's </font>license plate and the dog fight 
that ensued between Baxter and Ben was amusing for our BH3ers and NH3er. The 
visitors were all given down downs for visiting and asked to sing, they sang the 
same song they sing every week in Baahston, (time to start learning new songs, 
BH3ers, should we rent out <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for lessons?)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The On In was at the notorious Lil' Bear, with the usual 
college professors and executive professional types enjoying the preppy 
atmosphere. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>starting burning the chairs and 
tables in order to get more heat in this establishment, the pizza was delivered 
and the beer was consumed...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The other Olympic moments were at the end of the hash 
after the circle where <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font> changed out of 
wet clothes in the back of her car and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>ran 
around naked in the parking lot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On On</font></p>
