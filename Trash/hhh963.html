<p><font color="#008000">Run #963,</font> Sept 20, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Async</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">CoHare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Exeter/Richmond Line, on Rt 3</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; low 70’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Oozing SD, SESYB, Bondo, WIPOS, Just Josh, Just Drew. Visitors: 
Flounder (Floundering Ass-plant?) – Waukesha H3.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Absent:</font> Async, the hare!</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The original hare had been called back to work by an unsympathetic Bank of America tyrant, so he had preset some of 
the marks and arranged for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to act as co-hare and complete the trail. (Those who 
arrived had not been informed of this. Otherwise, no one would have made the run. How did <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> find out?) <font color="#FF0000">Just Josh</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Drew</font> arrived for their third(?) outing, showing a pitiful lack of intelligence, judgment, 
and common sense. And <font color="#FF0000">Flounder</font>, a visitor from Wisconsin, came expecting to hash this 
evening. Ha!</p>

<p>In the waning sunlight, promptly at 6:30, they were off bushwhacking north. They passed an abandoned lodge with a 
huge standing chimney and log framing, but not much roof. Regrettably, too early for the BC. On they went to a check on 
the Tefft Hill Trail, an abandoned dirt road perpendicular to 95. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> led west under 
95, and trail soon turned right onto the Dawley Trail. The next few checks were easily dealt with. The original hare 
might have given more of a challenge.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Josh</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Drew</font> along with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> caught up with 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> as they crossed west over Roaring Brook on a bridge. The original hare would have 
made them get their feet wet. They turned south to the shores of Roaring Brook Pond.</p>

<p>Flashlights were now required and several falsies were ignored as the trail skirted the pond. The dam at the 
southern end of the pond was reached, along with an arrow indicating that trail continued south. An arrow! A dam with 
a boardwalk! Obviously, trail had to cross the brook at some point. Why else an arrow instead of a check? A smart 
hasher could easily avoid the almost certain shiggy ahead. The original hare would have been cannier.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> broke from the pack to look for marks on the other side of the dam. Too bad he is 
almost blind at dusk, even with a light.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could be so stupid!</p>

<p>Trail continued south briefly, then crossed the brook east, and came on the Tefft Hill Trail again. The dread 
Blue Blazes appeared. They were back, yet again, on the North-South Trail! The original hare would probably have 
avoided this. Flour led northeast on the trail and then back west to… the boardwalk! The co-hare declared a Beer 
Check, despite the absence of markings to confirm this. What a lazy wank! But beer was retrieved from the bushes 
and consumed out on the dam.</p>

<p>Trail back was back east on the North-South Trail, and back under 95 to the reverse of the beginning. How 
imaginative. The original hare would likely have done better. But for all that, the ramshackle lodge was an ideal 
place to circle, and after reaching the cars, the circle was held in the center hall of the structure in front of 
the fireplace. The original hare would have had a fire. The run was rated: poor weather, lack of shiggy, North-South 
Trail: -0.69. (The original hare was given a +0.69, but this was withdrawn because of his poor choice in co-hare, 
and he ended up with a 0!) Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> for stupidity on the boardwalk.  After 
religion, they withdrew to exit 6, not 6A and dined at Marks. Another wasted evening with the RIH3.</p>
