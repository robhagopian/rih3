Hashshit- Rusty<br/><br/>

The notes prepared by Donkey suggest that this was an overcast evening of 65 degrees with rain, and so sets the scene for what would turn out to be a mix of either the longest or shortest Monday run that anyone has done in a while. It all depended on WHOm one followed on the faithful evening.No sign of the hares as the clock ticked towards the witching hour, an arrow at the rear of their car gave the barest of directions with nay hint of anything that would follow. We were on and soon found trail under a small barrier, Crabby & Async took a left at the check and WHO did what WHO does, he gave the trail some thought and decided on the direction that the loop would take and thus started the epic journey into the abyss of virgin flour, and untainted checks. Rusty also blew through the X and decided that following WHO is better than being in front of Basket.<br/><br/>

So, the small pack of two continued a few hundred yards and found another X followed by a check a short distance ahead. A moment of pause to see if we could hear the real pack of 16, alas nothing was heard. Were they stuck in an elevator shouting 11? Or worse still, had they found the first beer stop?? The two pack continued and found true trail off every check mark making them gain even further distance from the others, there was still no sound behind us and cries of “are you” lacked a response. Should we wait at the tit check, what would we see if we did, when would they show up, were they in front of us and laughing at the beer stop? All this and so much trail, we kept going, no beer, wait a whistle, no it’s a horn, no it’s a bird, keep going. WHO took the lead and Rusty followed, then Rusty took the lead and WHO followed, then WHO slowed down and Rusty slowed down…..there isn’t much to write about when it’s two.<br/><br/>

We were now at the edge of the woods facing blacktop, there was no flour and a note of desperation set in. Hold on though, the hares had used blue chalk on the road so that those smart arses driving in wouldn’t see the marks as they made their way to the run start. We crossed the road and headed to a rock that has a name like Overlook Rock, voices were heard, kids were smoking dope, more voices, whispers of on-on and then a BN. We were back in the land of the living, a quick climb up a 4.6 slope brought us to Hairy and LB laying on the rocks. Their immediate response was how the fuck did you two get here in one hour? The response didn’t matter, we found the growlers and started sucking down the IPA like a camel in a sandstorm. The pack arrived gradually over the next 45 minutes and then we ran the road back to the Kars.<br/><br/>

The circle formed and much whining was heard about the length of the run, probably 6.2 miles unless you did the smart loop of 3 miles. Notable moment in the circle goes to WIPOS for breaking the stick that Assquack was using to support his gimpy foot, and lynching moment goes to the circle for nominating me as the hashit when all I wanted to do was nominate WIPOS.<br/><br/>Dragon boat practice at 6pm yesterday, don’t be late.  <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	    
