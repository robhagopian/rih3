style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Starting in a 
light rain from a small park near the border of East Providence and Borrington, 
the pack headed west, and soon were lost. Finally, marks were found turning 
northwest into a bushwhack in a nice swamp. Flour conservation had been going 
on, and the hare gave helpful hints. But this was not virgin territory, and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> finally tired of the cold water alternating with 
briars. He turned northeast to get out to the old sand and gravel workings. The 
smart ones followed. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> stuck with the 
hare.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNoSpacing><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">A few sodden 
marks were found, indicating that the pack had made the right choice. But which 
way to go? The group circled around the open area, occasionally coming across a 
mark or a check. It seemed that trail was continuing northwest. Several falsies 
north were found. Even worse, the hare and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> 
were found. Finally, true trail was followed north to the tennis club, where 
trail crossed the parking lot and re-entered the woods eastward to the beer 
check.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The beer was 
quickly found and opened. Only <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> continued on, 
and then even he figured out that he was only FRB because the rest were enjoying 
their beer in his absence. Too bad the waning daylight wasn’t enough to lose him 
permanently. Few songs were sung, being within range of the tennis club, and 
once the beer was gone, flashlights came out, and trail 
resumed.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

led to the sides of the quarry briefly, and then headed south to a gate on 
Estrella Dr. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>The pavement was a 
painful end to the run, and they quickly circled up in the field beyond the 
cars. Ratings for the run: too much pavement, too few bimbos, no one lost versus 
at least some unavoidable shiggy, fine weather, and no <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! Total: +0. Hashit was given to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT>&nbsp;in the vain hope of seeing her ring. And 
finishing up, they made their way to the Red Bridge Tavern to abuse the waitress 
and behave childishly, yet again.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
