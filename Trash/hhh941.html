<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Torrential downpours on otherwise a balmy spring eve</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location: </font>B'ville aye!</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Tinker Bell, Fwangi Boner, WIPOS, BondoJovi </font>and

<p><font color="#0000FF">Write-Up:</font></p>

<p>Most of the oldies stayed away due to one of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. it was NOT raining, it was fooking raining cats and dogs<br>
2. it was an <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> run, too much of a challenge on a Mon nite<br>
3. there is NO such thing as virgin trail in B'ville <br>
4. given the average age of the absentees(ie. <font color="#FF0000">DrWho, Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font>) was above 50, they had their annual colonscopies scheduled that nite<br>
5. the final of American Idol was on.</p>

<p>Well, whatever the reason, the hare set this one live and was away before the pack showed up leaving instructions to 
the boner.&nbsp; The rest, as they say, is history.&nbsp; Here is one eloquent account: It¹s hard to find much to praise 
about our <font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD</font> (ask <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>), but on 26 April 2004 
he outdid himself. <font color="#FF0000">Raging Queen of Beers</font> (may his equipment forever be limp) had blown us 
off for some Boston white trash.&nbsp; At the last minute <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> (in his own words) 
&quot;stepped up to the wicket&quot; and hit 100 overs.&nbsp; He found some of Rhode Island¹s best 99% virgin shiggy, 
mud, slime, bullbriar, waist deep torrents, and laid a trail with such finesse that none of the pack was aware of the cold 
and the drizzle and the fact that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was on the run. The tricky back-checks and the circle 
jerks were but child¹s play. It was, however, the beer stop that showed our <font color="#FF0000">Oozing¹s</font> genius 
as a live hare. Somehow he had found a cave in the rocks, sheltered from the storm, and had furnished it in a style 
reminiscent of the Arabian Nights. Silken pillows were strewn on the Persian carpets, dimly illuminated by hundreds of 
tiny oil lamps, and there reclining on the pillows were seductively perfumed serving wenches.&nbsp; One beckoned to <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, another even more voluptuous slithered across the rug to <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi, 
Bondo</font> fainted from loss of blood, and so <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>had two for his pleasure. The sultry 
one in the corner reserved for <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> (no show, the wank) just pouted. Yes, even <font 
color="#FF0000">Hourly</font> Rate had her own swarthy eunuch. Before long the selection of some of the world¹s best 
micro-brews was depleting and expectations were rising. Ah, I could go on, but &quot;Who&quot; would believe me? <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, you¹ll never know what you missed.</p>

<p>The ONIN was at Teresa's shrine, where the pack was offered their pick of lovely young nuns, as well as bread and wine, 
of course. The hashit was awarded to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, for a very good reason.</p>
