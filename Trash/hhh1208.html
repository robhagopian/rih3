traditional holiday 2 PM start, the visitors, as is often the case, outnumbered 
the regulars. They will never learn. The hash started from Douglas Lumber(?) on 
Rt 7, well within the 295 beltway. Promptly, under the watchful eyes of the 
local constabulary who had appeared to direct traffic away from the North 
Providence parades, they were off, southeast on Rt 7 and almost immediately 
turning west into the woods. Suspicious behavior? I think not!<?xml:namespace

southwest to a series of paths, overgrown paths, imperceptible deer paths, and 
no paths, through light mud and briars. It seemed quite good for a while. And 
for quite a while it was. Most were stymied in an area which had a muddy stream, 
several fallen trees and a stone wall. Most ended up with mud on the shoes. Most 
ended up with a wee scratch or two. But despite the incompetent and 
irresponsible markings, the irrepressible and intrepid <FONT color=#ff0000>Dr 
WHO</FONT> was able to find his way out to Ridge Road. Perhaps there was a beer 
check somewhere in there. I am sure I do not know.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

ran past a gathering of public service workers, who looked enviously at the 
hashers bleeding and muddy legs, as they gathered up their protective gear to go 
and search for the source of all this anthrax powder that had mysteriously 
appeared in Smithfield. A right turn led into a lovely capped landfill. Ah, the 
smell of methane in the early afternoon! What an appetite stimulant.

to Peter Randall State Park. Paths were found and followed, west parallel to 
some residential streets. Finally, they came down into the development and found 
the ultimate goal: <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger’s</FONT> Pig Roast! <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> had 
skipped the hash to feed us! How sweet. Too bad they were also feeding half the 
sociopaths in the neighborhood, as well. But at least there was beer 
pong.<BR><BR>The hashers straggled in, and they circled under a pine tree at the 
side of <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger’s</FONT> house, joined by latecummers 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Dogmeat</FONT>, with 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Just Mel</FONT> as a two-tree timer. Ratings for the run: A 
to B, some shiggy, some pavement, extraordinary bimbos with <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Nice Tits</FONT> (yes, she did!), and the promise of a fine Pig 
Roast to follow. And no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo!</FONT> Total: +69! Hashit

that followed was fine, the evening approached with cool breezes and plenty of 
beer. But the sound of choppers filled the air. Gunfire (from the North 
Providence Beagle Club) disrupted the calm of the evening. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> began screaming in Vietnamese. And one of the party 
members insulted <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT> mustache. In Arabic! This 
was enough to send <FONT color=#ff0000>Justin My Ass</FONT> into a frenzy. Like 
Rambo in “First Blood”, he meant no harm. But the resulting mayhem would best be 
left undescribed. And I’m pretty tired of this freakin’ write-up. As, I am sure, 
are you.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
