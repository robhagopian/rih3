</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">moving into his new pad in the area of Lincoln
it was a great excuse to get aquatinted with some new territory, just to
put the record straight we cannot call Lincoln the Southern HQ as East
Greenwich is certainly more southern than Lincoln, never the less this
spot is worthy of some distinctive name, hence central HQ it will be. Attendees
on this cold evening (30 degrees F) were </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The off was duly set at 6.30pm after the formal
photographs were taken with the trusty Polaroid. First a quick circle jerk
before we got into a sort of trot, your scribe sporting a soccer injury
fell behind, and on his behind on a number of occasions, one thing which
was not short was flour, perhaps the best marked trail of the year. A couple
of checks took us eventually around a school area before heading into trail
and frozen shiggy which most of us skated across, except </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
who preferred a one mile detour to avoid his feet getting wet. Shiggy has
been absent for some weeks until this run where frozen shiggy was the order
of the day, in between climbing under fences. I was assuming the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Snot</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was at the rear, unbeknown to me </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
had taken off carving his own trail. At one point I lost trail but took
a short cut down the side of the highway after coming across a couple of
falsies. fortunately I later managed to locate the trail and that wonderful
“B” sign to find the pack near an open fire sucking grog. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Songs were sung in the hope the deaf old git would
hear us, but we realize now he is deaf. (Too much wanking as a boy), with
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">still
missing we decided to leave the silly old sod to his own devices after
he was a no show at the beer stop. The trail home was by the side of the
river, all back except </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
until after a while we heard the Bugle from a fart, no I meant afar. The
circle was formed with virtually every body getting a down down, with the
Hashshit flying around like a bad smell before the final award going to
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Beyond Hope</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
who duly deserved the tribute. This was also an occasion for the naming
of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s handle
which started off as “</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dick the Phone”. Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
being a shrink of sorts was not happy with this and whilst eating fine
grub made by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little Neck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
he commented it should be changed, the group agreed and he was given the
much better handle of “</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing Syphilitic Dick
The Phone</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">” for editorial purposes we will
use </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing Syph </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">for
short, to which our latest new member has been christened, we all think
its a well suited name as in Pakistani it means “Remember at any initial
christening not to put foot in mouth”. A few more beers and songs sung
before we finally departed. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
finally got his just deserts for pissing on peoples cars, as his handle
and locks were frozen over with piss from an unknown source much to the
amusement of your scribe. On-On</FONT></P>
