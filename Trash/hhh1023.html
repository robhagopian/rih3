<p><font color="#008000">Run #1023</font>, November 7, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Trail Hoover (SESYB)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Foxboro, MA (F. Gilbert Hills State Park)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 50’s, breezy and dry</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish It Head, Basket, Bondo, Dr. WHO, Dry Foot Fairy, Just Sandra, Oozing, 
Ponder On It, WIPOS, Yank My Doodle, Ben and Seamus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>There were only two reasons to be in Foxboro that Monday night:  first was to watch the Pats lose to the Colts, yet 
again; and the second was to hash with RIH3.  69,069 fans packed Gillette Stadium.  11 showed up for the hash.  Quantity, 
as it seems, does not equate to quality.  The Patriots lost.  11 losers hashed.  Coincidence?  I think not!  Did any of 
this make any sense?  I think not!</p>

<p>And with that, the run started out of the  F. Gilbert Hills State Park parking lot off Thurston St.  Trail headed 
northeast with some pseudo-bushwhacking up a hill.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>
 lead the pack up the hill to a check that confused most.  Some went west, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> went north to a large rock, but true trail headed east led by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>.  Who knew where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went (no, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> did not know), but 
that was the last time anyone had seen him.  Not that anyone would complain!</p>

<p>That our faithful RIH3 bimbo <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> was the hare, it surely inspired confidence (or 
stupidity) in other harrierettes to come out – including three-timer <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font>, the 
long-lost transplant <font color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font>, and the world-travelling RISD graduate <font 
color="#FF0000">Ponder On-It</font>.  Only <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> was missing, thus eluding the trat hick.  
Nobody complained, particularly <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, since the only reason why his wife lets him hash on 
Monday nights is the (false) impression that only guys partake in this weekly cult ritual.  Yes, where virgins are 
sacrificed, it IS a cult.  But I digress.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the trail, true trail bent southward against all instinctive attempts by <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> to lead the pack back west.  Only <font color="#FF0000">Ponder</font> took the bait, being continually 
suckered down falsies.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> blazed the way along 
rocky foot paths, up and down, up and down.  <font color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font> seemed to enjoy this.  Only 
everyone managed to twist and ankle, and/or eat dirt (just ask <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font>).  And everyone 
managed to re-group heading east along Wolf Meadow Rd., where <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> took off along Tupelo Trail as <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> headed down an obvious falsie and obviously trying to pull the rest with him.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were perfectly content keeping <font
color="#FF0000">Ponder</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font>, 
and the hare company.  Who wouldn’t?  Yes, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would, but didn’t.</p>

<p>After numerous marks, the FRB trio hit a large “X” on trail.  Demoralized, they decided to call the others to follow.  
They saw seven bobbing lights slowly making their way toward them, and when they arrived, the trio broke out in 
sheep-talk (whatever that is), mocking the others.  How pathetic!  Even worse, the line of eight bobbing lights continued 
right past the three-some sheep, following the marks they had missed.  FRBs turned DFLs in an obvious act of stupidity.  
Not the first time, nor will it be the last, that’s for sure!</p>

<p>Trail soon headed westward along High Rock Rd. where a check could have gone anywhere.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> went north, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> searched south, and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> decided 
to look at the trail map at the intersection (brilliant!).  Convinced that the beer check would be on High Rock, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> led the others westward.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font> looked worried.  A “BN” 
was soon reached and pointing southward.  Next to a stream, beer was opened and savored along with chips and cheetos.  All 
were happy and joyious!  Not to mention the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  How glorious!!!</p>

<p>Perfection, as it seems, would not last.  Somewhere across the stream, a bobbing head lamp wandered back and forth, 
through briars and thickets.  Everyone turned off their lights, except for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, whose light 
was so bright, he could direct a 747 to a landing.  Thus, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> managed to join the rest.  
Unfortunately, there was still beer left over.</p>

<p>Until now, the trail was relatively eventless, despite the occasional trip over a rock (just ask <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font>).  Realizing this, the hare decided to live-hare the rest of the trail back to the 
cars.  Nobody made much of this, as this would surely be the shortest and easiest leg of the hash.  Not!  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> got lost.  
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> led the others… lost.  Ah, hashing at its best.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
managed to bring the others back onto true trail, as he has undoubtedly visited this part of the trail at least three 
times searching for the pack.</p>

<p>Finally, all managed to reach the cars.  Everyone climbed back up the hill to a large rock.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> managed to slip and leave a good part of his shin.  Surely, he did this in protest to the lack 
of shiggy!  <font color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font>, so impressed with her third hash, couldn’t resist herself and called 
someone on her cell phone to tell them all about it (and missing half the circle).</p>

<p>Circle was held, and if I could tell you all the comments on the run, I would, but beer has this strange side-affect 
that hinders memory.  However, I believe some comments included the loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> up to the 
beer check, four (yes, 4!) bimbos, copious blood on trail, and multiple mis-directions by the hare (intentional or not).  
Only the fine weather and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> finding the beer check hampered what could otherwise be a 
fine and glorious hash.  Oh yeah, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> wasn’t there to remind the hare what time of the 
month it was for her.  Needless to say, everyone else did.  Total:  <b>+0.69</b>!  Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> for leading <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to the BC.</p>

<p>Minus <font color="#FF0000">Yank My Doodle</font>, everyone meandered down to Box Seats for some beer and grub.  Even 
stuffing the pack into the back room away from the others didn’t stop the compliments and praises from the patrons to the 
point where the manager had to tell us to shut-up.  It seems the football clientelle have moral limits!  Thank God for the 
hash to put things into proper perspective!  Thankful that we didn’t chase ALL the patrons out of the restaurant, the 
manager offered gifts (little bar trinkets) and gift certificates (5 bucks each), enticing us to return and entertain 
others.  When will they ever learn?</p>
