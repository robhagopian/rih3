<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">4/12/08: We are still in summary mode here. But not many of 
these runs was worth more than a brief summary. The hare was hoping to get rid 
of<font color="#FF0000"> Ben</font>. So he set from the spot that has accounted 
for more dog deaths than any other in RI, the Big River Area north of Rt 95. And 
the trail was set none too soon, as there is major construction going on behind 
the former Mark’s/Rosie’s/Whatever Grille (now closed, as well!) More prime 
territory going away!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The trail was counterclockwise for the thrid week in a row. 
The snow was gone, and the mud was viscous. Trail entered the woods immediately, 
through a new construction area that had only just started to be roughly graded. 
The mud was fine. Turning right, the pack came on the trails which lead north to 
the trailer park. A check turned them west and they bushwhacked up the side of 
Hungry Hill. The summit of this mighty peak (410’ above sea level!) was avoided, 
and they turned back north on the long ridge. Everyone was pretty much together 
until they came down to the trails leading to the Fishing area on Harkney Hill 
Road. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> guessed correctly, and turned south, 
calling on the visitor, while <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> turned north, all-too briefly.
<font color="#FF0000">WHO </font>tried some of the side trails, recalling some 
fine shiggy closer to the river. But <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> just 
carried on and led <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">La La</font> to the beer check at the fishing clearing 
just south of the widening of the river known as Reynolds Pond. The beer was 
found and opened. Lights were doused in an attempt to lose <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, but to no avail. So the 
usual songs were trotted out.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Trail on back was simply a completion of the loop: east up 
the hill, approching Rt 95 then north behind the motel back into the mud flats 
of the construction area. The Circle was held just out of sight of the parking 
lot. Ratings for the run: Some shiggy, but no bimbos, no losses and a live dog. 
Total: -0.69. Hashit: Hazarding a guess at this point, I’m going out on a limb 
and saying: Basket. Why not? The group moved into the Former Mark’s/Rosie’s for 
what turned out to be probably the last time, although we didn’t know it at the 
time. Very sad. What’s next? Will Cady’s become a wine bar? And will the Oak 
Hill start “Veggie Night” on Monday’s. Thank God for Li’l Bear!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On On</p>
