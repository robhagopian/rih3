color=#000000>The virgins from the preceding week had not learned their lesson. 
Obviously, they thought we were joking when we advised them to skip a week in 
view of the harefor this outing. But surprisingly, the hare stepped up to the 
plate (sort of) and we did not just circle around the block to have the beer 
check-circle combo in the garage.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail started off with excuses about the rain washing out the 
marks. Ha! As if… The pack headed down Meadow and entered Cold Spring Park. A 
falsie downstream along the river occupied their time for quite a while. Finally 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> found the remnant of what once might have been 
a mark in the opposite direction, and the pack followed. Trail crossed the river 
at the Singleton St. bridge.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

Rhodes Ave. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT

hill. But no marks were seen. <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Shemale Man</FONT> ran uphill, downhill, up 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Ave. 
and back, even heading back to Laurel St. The two-timers <FONT

appeared to be interested in exercise, as they faithfully followed all the false

color=#000000>Finally a mark was seen on 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Ave. This led to 
Fairmount, and they turned right, guided by pschic intuition no doubt, because 
flour had nothing to do with it. Almost at the top of the hill, they found a 
mark and turned right on 8<SUP>th</SUP> or 9<SUP>th</SUP> to find the hare and 
his friend <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Burt</FONT>. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Burt</FONT> had obviously been smoking something way too strong and had agreed 
to host the Beer Check in his garage. The pack straggled 
in.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The BC was marked by fine garage acoustics with which the pack 
serenaded the host, his wife and his teenaged daughter. Her boyfriend sampled a 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>-brew. This may be a good thing, as it will 
probably put him off beer forever. But distant sirens were heard, probably 
summoned by the neighbors. It was time to leave.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The way back was dead reckoning, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> led the leaders across the Fairmount bridge and up 
Blackstone to Highland to Meadow. When all were gathered, they circled up, in 
the garage. The run was rated. Excellent weather,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>more than 1 mile of actual trail, and a 
beer check outside of the hare’s home were good. But the lack of shiggy, the 
miles of pavement, and no one lost on trail counterbalanced nicely. Total: +0. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Just Burt</FONT> was questioned. The two-timers were brought 
in again, and told another joke. Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Shemale 
Man</FONT>. Don’t even bother to ask. Finishing up, they moved upstairs for more 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>-brew and chili. Ah, Tuesday mornings&nbsp;after 
a <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> hash! Has to be experienced, at least 
once.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
