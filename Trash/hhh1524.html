It was damp, misty day with temperature around 69 degrees.  Everyone knew they were f-ucked when we were instructed to put our dry clothes in Bondo's truck.<br/><br/>

Trail was marked with plenty of poison ivy with an occasional flour mark.  As the pack wondered through the forest of Burrillville, doing several river crossings, a 5.6 slippery rock climb and a beer spot with Bondo's IPA.<br/><br/>

The Hare cleverly had a Turkey/Eagle Split at the river, which was designed for deception.   Never follow Basket.<br/><br/>

It was a good crowd at the Circle back at Snake Hill Road, with many unseen faces from long ago and with a roaring fire where the pool use to be.<br/><br/>

WIPOS was falsely accused of knocking himself out while walking into a tree limb, but was saved by Dog Meat as she sang her personal rendition of "When I was a Little Girl."  The Hashit is now located in Bondo's truck.<br/><br/>

The Hash celebrated an Italian Feast with meatballs, sausages, pesto pasta and bread.  Tops with a homemade sour cream coffeecake.<br/><br/>

All in all, a good time where everyone got wet and there where no MIA's.
