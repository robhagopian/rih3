This worst-trail-of-the-year nominee started out at the unimproved Bondo
residence - unimproved in that it appears zero work has taken place since
the last we visited. We started out in his backyard, with the toilet, no
crops, and some of the best beer he has ever produced (oak aged, if I
recall). We proceeded out to be jerked around* for a short while and then
ended up at another nearby venue that also had a toilet in the back yard.
We had beers and a small fire there and returned to Bondo's. Circle was
had with a raging fire and food afterwards with not as much potluck as in
the past.
