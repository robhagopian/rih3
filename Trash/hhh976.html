<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hare set trail in fresh snow in Uxbridge MA. This is an area with nothing whatsoever to recommend it. But there 
you are. No consideration or planning went into this one. As usual. A small group of the stalwarts gathered at the end 
of a small dead end road off 146A at the borders of Uxbridge, Millville and North Smithfield, RI. After some excuses 
and instructions, they were off.</p>

<p>No marks were seen at first. The hare had instructed them to cross 146 on Coppola Rd, so they turned northeast and 
after crossing, picked up some faint red powder marks in the wind-driven snow. But it was enough as <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>led southeast on Providence St and then at a check, northeast on Quaker. They were 
pretty much together as they came to a powerline. Trail was found heading northwest.</p>

<p>The trail was now a prolonged run through unsheltered freezing winds, with all footprints and most of the 
flour/chalk blown away. The hare stayed with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, WHO</font> and the <font color="#FF0000">
Fairy</font> at first, but as they continued downhill into the wind, he stayed back to let <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker, Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> catch up. They were heading downhill, but their gonads 
were heading uphill. The leaders came through some brush onto River Rd and a check tempted them to cross the 
Blackstone River. But <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, WHO </font>and the <font color="#FF0000">Fairy</font> continued 
west to an old Drive-In Theater and another check. The trailing pack had by now decided to pack it in and they were 
already on their way to the cars. The hare decided to stick with them.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> continued on the road, and finally found 
a mark. This led to a check that seemed to lead to a tractor-trailer depot. But no marks were seen. They tried back 
on the road. No marks were seen. They found <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>. He had seen no marks. After 
much debate, they decided that trail must have crossed the depot, so they climbed over a berm covered with tires 
and refuse, entered a backyard, and made their way through a field back to 146A. No marks. They decided to head back, 
and they ran passed the (closed) Hannah’s (with a sigh of regret, as <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had brought 
ample cab-fare for more than one pitcher).</p>

<p>A mark was finally seen as they passed a Sand and Gravel pit on the left. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried 
to follow east, but there were no more marks. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> tried west, but it became clear that 
they were backtracking, so the three returned to the pit and spread out over the snows. Finally a check was discovered 
at the bottom of the pit, and traced up to a RR grade heading east-west. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> tried 
east. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> tried west. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> ran back and forth 
aimlessly. Through a stroke of luck, the <font color="#FF0000">Fairy </font>found the beer along the trail, with no 
markings. He called the others and they started the BC. Interestingly, as beer was being sipped, ice crystals formed 
and enlarged rapidly so that the beer consisted of large ice balls by the time they were half finished. But they 
persevered and even started some songs. But headlights appeared below suddenly. The hare had arrived to pick up his 
beer, secure in the knowledge that no one could have found it on this night. Ha!</p>

<p>He claimed to have been out searching for the trio. He tried to look concerned. He said he had checked the whole 
trail looking for them. A likely story. At any rate, they packed up and drove back to the cars, and then convoyed 
to Burrillville. The others were already by the fire, watching TV, and well-lubricated, so it took some effort to get 
the circle underway. This occurred after some food. Ratings for the run were mixed: poor marks, but great weather; 
prolonged powerlines, but loss of 50% of the hashers; lack of shiggy, but lack of <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>; 
lack of bimbos, but lots of beer-sicles at the Beer Check. Total:+0.69. Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. 
Why not? As they finished the circle and the food, the football game came on, and another evening ended.</p>
