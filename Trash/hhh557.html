<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A run with a difference this week starting in
Attleboro Mass, but are we not the Rhode Island Hash?? perhaps they do
not have any trains that run on time. Attendees on this cold evening (30
degrees F) were Basket (hare), </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async, Rusty,
Plume, Sajid, Short Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> and yours truly.
We understand that </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">is
still nursing some bruised limbs obviously from some obscure sexual activity
with Fergie. Hurry up and recover we need a fast runner to help us through
the checks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The hare was anxious to get us off on time, why
this week was the question. The off was held up due to our psychologist
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> being late,
due to a phone call on the old dog and bone. Your scribe </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Snot</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
turned up with the usual ice cream bar for some extra energy. The suggested
parking area looked a little risky, which came apparent when cats and dogs
were sighted with dustbin lids (trash can lids) on their heads. Car tyres
(correct British spelling) were sold from a local house complete with rims,
all runners were a little dubious what to expect on our return. The off
was brisk with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
looking anxious and directing us quicker than normal onto trail, an unusual
behavior would you not agree </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">?
we were later to find out the reason why. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short
Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> an unusual attendee of late was wheezing
behind and sporting a cough of at least 40 cigs a day. His unusual technique
of rolling down hills on his side was perhaps a way of getting more oxygen
into those smoke filled lungs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At one point your scribe was blazing the trail
as a FRB for at least 30 seconds before </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
stormed past, trail was a mixture of woodland, road and thorn filled trail.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rusty </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">was leading
the pack for most of the front end due to the fact he had the brightest
flashlight. The pack was well split apart by the time we got close to a
railway line, with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
blowing furiously on his bugle to lead us toward the beer stop which was
to be a train ride from South Attleboro station. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">had collected the grog from a nearby hedge
and the train was waiting on the platform with everybody present except
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> who
eventually showed up on the wrong platform by which time the train pulled
off and we all waved good-bye to our ride, a Basket family member strikes
again. Should we have left him? as it turns out it was probably the best
thing that happened as the run back was relatively short. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The beer stop was carried out on the platform
with some sweet liquor and cocoa, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
went to find out when the next ride was and duly informed us the earliest
train was not for at least another two hours. The run back which I have
to say was unmarked (Hashshit material) was through shopping areas and
pavement on back to where the vehicles were not knowing what to find. Vehicles
intact we then proceeded by car to the second beer stop for our circle
up, the run which was poorly marked on the return trail and the fact that
the hare was unable to hold up the train the run was awarded -4.6 the extra
mark being awarded for the novelty of having a beer stop on a railway platform.
Hashshit was awarded to the only one deserving of it which incidentally
was the person wearing it-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">!

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The on-on was in down town Pawtucket in a small
bar where the occupants soon vacated after hearing the singing of the RIH3,
one noteworthy point was when a young lady (depends on how many drinks
you had had) fraternizing with the crew was sung that noteworthy French
song of allouette, as it turned out to a very upset husband whose hair
transplant had gone wrong and his wig had blown off in the wind. His macho
stand of threatening our trusted hare came to nothing as he was dragged
out by the lady. (I have just been reminded that there are no ladies in
RI or Mass). A good time was had by all and this was a good training run
for next week! On-On</FONT></P>
