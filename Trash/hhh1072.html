<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>This is the short version. There is no long version. There was no prelube. At the start, there was no hare. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was a coy co-hare. There were two cute virgins. One of them had a friend who runs with the 
NY/Westchester hashes. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> got annoying. He talked about Ian Cummings for the whole run. 
Bet the virgins will be back next week!</p>

<p>Trail entered the woods at the north side of the lumberyard. It went northeast. It was a prolonged bushwhack with a few 
checks. The pack stayed together.  This was mostly to shadow the two cute virgins. But <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s
</font> stories eventually drove most away. The trail led to some rough-cut, overgrown lumber trails. Trail crossed some 
small streams, branches of the West River. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> led. They took a wrong turn. They came back. They rejoined <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Candy Caner</font> and the two cute virgins. They also 
found a confused <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS
</font> were no where to be seen. But it took the co-hare so long to figure out which way to go, that they caught up. 
That’s a very long time!</p>

<p>They continued north. They crossed a powerline. They bushwhacked. They followed a stone wall with barbed wire. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> didn’t trip. They crossed some fields. They came out on Whipple Rd. The hare showed up. 
There was no rejoicing at this turn of events. They turned east. They turned onto Angell Rd south. There were no marks. 
The hare and co-hare led right into a development. There were still no marks. There was an awful lot of pavement. They 
curved left. They turned right. They turned right again. They came to a cul-de-sac under construction. There was beer. 
Even <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> made it. Pathetic.</p>

<p>The two cute virgins had some beer. The beer was an unimpressive mix of old bottled beers. They positioned themselves 
as far away from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> as possible. <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> began to hit on them. Bet they’ll be back next week! Rhubarb commenced. <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> peed in the circle. Another typical beer check.</p>

<p>On out, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Candy Caner</font> took off onto the roads. They 
went backwards to Whipple. So they said! The rest of the pack ran back into the woods. They curved south. They came out on 
Linfield. They came back to Angell. They turned right on Twin Rivers. They completed the clockwise loop back to the cars. 
The two cute virgins complained about run length. They show real promise. Bet they’ll be back next week! They worried 
about <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Candy Caner</font>. The rest worried about <font 
color="#FF0000">Candy Caner</font>. The police arrived. The sight of a half-naked <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> sent 
them on their way.</p>

<p>The circle began. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> peed. Ratings began and were interrupted by the arrival of <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Candy Caner</font>. The presence of two cute virgins, and the virgin 
territory could not outweigh the lack of marks, the lack of shiggy, the prolonged pavement and the lack of arrests. 
Total: <b>-6.9</b>. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> (false accusations). The two cute virgins were 
brought into the circle. They got none of the questions right. They didn’t sing. They didn’t show their rings. They did 
tell a joke about muffins. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> peed on <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. Bet they’ll be 
back next week!</p>

<p>On On On was held at Stuffies on Mineral Spring Ave. The two cute virgins attended. They hadn’t heard the one about 
picking someone up at the airport. And that’s all there is to say.</p>
