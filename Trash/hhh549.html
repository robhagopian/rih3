<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">IAfter driving seventy bloody miles on the Sunday
to get to a Newport run with instructions leading to the armory, what they
fail to tell us is which one, I found three! Both Basket and I going round
in circles, I eventually went home and Basket unknown to me was still driving
around for a further two hours before two solitary runners showed. What
a piss poor excuse for a Hash, Newport, come to see how a real Hash is
run.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">However this week was a little different as the
instructions were almost as poor quality as Newport’s, which had been put
onto our great new web page (Produced by Async) Basket’s instructions were
obviously given when he had consumed one two many Rolling Rocks (his favorite
beer), up 146 to the 126 exit, only problem was there is no exit labeled
126 and I as well as Rusty went almost to bloody Seekonk, before U turning.
In America the last place you go to ask directions is a petrol (gas) station
I am just amazed the workers get there, after asking three stuffed attendants
for help, one had no idea and the other two reached for maps in a different
state. I decided to head into Lincoln and went into an off license (liquor
store) as always these guys are quite bright (except Basket), this particular
gent directed me to the venue, Lincoln Davies Tech. To which I arrived
at 6.40pm. It so happens one of the new boots had somehow made it-Wynn.
I later learned another new boot was still driving around at 7.00pm. He
however wants to come again to meet the pratt who gave such disgusting
directions. In your defense Basket and I didn’t tell him who it was, I
suggested good Hashers always find the run, providing there is one at the
appointed time, unlike some beginning with N. But I have to agree these
were shit instructions plus to add insult to injury Basket parked over
the on out direction, and who said he didn’t deserve the Hashshit for the
rest of the year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Being a determined Bastard I set off only to slip
on some ice and cut my leg open, tourniquet applied I continued leaving
my own trail of red marks which soon stopped in the cold low 30’s air.
As usual I was last again but felt quite comfortable as this was my usual
position at the start of most runs, fortunately our hare Little Neck had
left a reasonable trail with colored flour but in the snow it was easy
to follow the trail, the next part was the only part where Basket was useful,
the sound of breaking wind, no it was a bugle-I thought. Sure enough in
the distance was the distinctive noise of the RIH3 “where the f*** is the
trail” I yelled out how are yuu, Hopeless came out of the thorns trying
to avoid a water crossing as usual and in no time at all I was at the front
leading the pack before everybody overtook me. Marks were tough to see
especially when the torch (flashlight) batteries run low, I don’t know
about Duracell I always manage to buy the batteries that have already been
tested for hours and hours. The run was cunning in the way nobody could
find the trail at the checks because you could not see the bloody marks!
On more than one occasion our hare helped to bring back our new boots,
the shiggy was plentiful with the water under the ice being f***** cold
on more than one occasion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Basket as usual went on one of his own trails
before catching up with the rest of the pack round a big loop through every
bit of shiggy and ice water in Lincoln. Finally arriving at the beer stop,
with the new boots not knowing what to expect next. The beer unlike the
run was actually quite good and was the only thing not frozen. The on home
was fairly straight forward through the grounds of Lincoln Tech, on route
Rusty and Basket clashed with Basket accidentally on purpose catching Rusty
in the eye for the poxy instructions given by the Newport Hash last Sunday.
Circle up in the car park with runners present being Basket, Rusty (Newport),
Hopeless, Ringworm (Idaho Hash),Crew Doo, Wynn(new boot), Little Neck (hare)
and of course your newly appointed Hon Sec (scribe). The run was rated
far too highly by the newcomers but was soon brought down to a more respectable
level by the more experienced members plus one was the final gross average
which was the highest rating for any run this week. Beer was getting low
but was understandable from previous attendance levels, with ceremonies
for hare, visitors and virgins complete it was round to Little Necks pad
for some healthy grub and more good beer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The singing was by far the best heard for over
a year, the song book was very useful but our virgin Wynn had great trouble
remembering the words, which qualifies him for the RIH3. Maybe it was the
beer but a good time was had by all. The following morning your scribe
woke up with a pair of lips any true African gentleman would have been
proud of, if you had licked my lips you could have stuck me on any window.
My eyes looked as though I had been ten rounds with Mike Tyson, a food
allergy had finally got the man who thought he could eat anything, I can
only pin it down to two things the black beans (or was it Iguana shit)
or my bodies reaction to the awful singing, the latter it has to be because
the food was bloody good grub and nobody else suffered. Much to the amusement
of my work colleagues I went to work but the prescribed tablets took effect
very quickly. Listen guys whatever you do, either piss poor instructions,
poison or whatever the British Snot is here to stay. (Until my work contract
runs out).</FONT></P>
