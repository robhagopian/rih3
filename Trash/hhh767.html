<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Twas another lovely cold eve with lots of snow
around and expectations high</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">for another
rollicking hash as we all gathered at the necksters abode 'neath the newly
reconstructed Rt. 116 bridge.&nbsp; We were to be disappointed. Hashers that
gathered incl. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Basket, WIPOS, Async, Suck the
Clam,Dr Who Slasher, Blew Bondo</font>, the horny trio of Jake,Ben and Baxter
and of course yours truly (er, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> if you didn't
figure it out).&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Little Neck</font> was the sorry
hare.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="1">Little Neck's date for the evening</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the hare set us off on the trail, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>set off in the opposite direction. To the untrained eye, this may have
been interpreted as oppositional, or the need to assert his own identity or
merely obstinate.&nbsp; However the sad truth is he's plain daft and just can't
comprehend simple instructions and that's why he has two &quot;guide dogs&quot;
to help him!&nbsp; Some hashers chose to ski and were soon in the lead
negotiating all too familiar terrain, leading the pack up a hill, around some
trees, across a road blah blah and around and back to the Necker's abode
(actually I made it sound longer and more exciting than the trail really was!)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was lost for
awhile and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, to the dismay of none, was
nowhere to be seen. Beer and singing ensued, and down downs for the hares <font color="#FF0000">Lil'
Neck</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (who had nothing to do with
the trail), the absentee hashit (<font color="#FF0000">Async</font>) and ONON at
the house. Despite the tasty food and good beer, <font color="#FF0000">Necker's</font>
better half was conspicuously absent.&nbsp; At least one of them showed
creativity by taking off! As usual, much reminiscing about past hashes followed,
probably because not much to say about today's hash, despite the fact I've
bullshitted about it for far too long. Oh, and to make matters worse, <font color="#FF0000">Wipos</font>
returned. On On...the scribe. </font></p>
