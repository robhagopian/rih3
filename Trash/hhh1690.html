First issue for this pack related to parking, would there be enough?? Could Amish park a boat at the beach without a sticker?? Turned out to be a non-issue because there were no real waves for surfing and the place was virtually empty. Some snuck down a cold beer while we waited for instructions from the hare, they turned out to be somewhat reminiscent of a Newport H3 trail. The hare, Crooner, needed a 10 minute head start and Irish stayed to tell us what to expect. Those instructions included a really elaborate check with an X in the middle and then one letter from RIH3 occupied each slice of the circle, it should have been obvious at this point that things were going to hell in a handbasket. Ten minutes passed and we headed out onto the lovely beach, alas NO we went along Hanging Rock Rd parallel to the beach and pounded pavement. Assquack led the way as we rounded the corner by hanging rock road, the reservoir was looming above us and AQ found trail that took us up the rickety stairs and aloft of the roadway. <br/><br/>

He was followed by more FRB"s as they headed North along the dike, at the far end of the East side AQ ducked in the bushes, swiftly followed by Butt Plug and then a few others. It looked like and sounded like a beer stop, but the devious hare had set aside a mere 4 pack for the FRB"s to consume as they waited for the rest of the pack. WHO was almost at the FRB stop when the group came back out of the bushes and told him it was a YBF. At this point Basket led us astray & on to a YBF2, nobody was amused & he was nominated for hashit on the spot.<br/><br/>

Of we went back in the direction from which we came, confused about where to go next, we found the rickety stairs again with AQ ignoring it and continuing along the dike and Rusty et al making their way back down to the road. That was the last time we saw AQ until the "real" beer stop. I think this is where we lost the other female visitor too. The pack found trail in the main parking lot right over the jersey barrier, we made our way East following flour all the way. Next thing we know we"re screwed, we got to the end of the lot & found that we had been running trail backwards. Lickit was confused, WHO tried to figure it out, WIPOS was miles behind, Crotchy and Frosted headed to the beach, and then we heard the 'hare on the dike" shouting "you're going the wrong way". WTF, he was telling us to go in the opposite direction to the two arrows we were looking at.<br/><br/>

Onto pavement again, this time alongside the campground between second & third beach, all the time listening to the hare barking orders like he was running some type of Marine Corps training course. Then we heard it, at least Basket heard it & then Rusty heard it..."turn left" he said to which Basket made the left only to be told "not that left". Time was moving on and the pack was getting agitated, finally the pounding of pavement ended at Peabody Beach. Trail brought us out to the waters edge, AQ & F of the Irish were in the water sucking down beers with a snide grin on their faces. The pack looked for a live extension cord to chuck in the water, none found but we will probably have one for future trails. We all went in the water, had a beer, ate some orange food, sang some songs and then there was this guy standing on the sand looking at us. He said nothing, he looked like he owned the beach and he was waiting for us to make it to the median tide point to tell us to get the F off his beach. Turned out that he was a hasher too & didn't want to get his shoes wet, so we tossed him a beer. Then, FINALLY we were pounding soft sand, all the way across Third Beach and then the full length of Second Beach. But...WHO knew better, he said the walk along the dike is shorter, and so WHO & Hamster meandered off into the sunset and found out that it wasn't a short cut after all.<br/><br/>

Back at the cars some bathed under the fresh water showers at Surfers end, then we made our way to Purgatory Chasm to hold the circle, comments were as expected, no mention of the hares going in the dog house though. That probably had something to do with the fact that we forgot about it.<br/><br/>

Comments on the trail were mixed, WHO said the total was a negative 0.69 or something like that. Rusty got hashit because nobody else was good enough for it. The usual religion took place, everyone promised to come back next week, Crotchy sold her finest Cup Cakes in the parking lot, & then we drifted off to Tickets down the street.
