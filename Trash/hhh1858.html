Run #1858 The Mystery Hare: Return of Hairy Krishna or When It Rains, It Pours<br/>When: Oct 4, 2021 <br/>Weather: You Have to Ask?<br/>Hounds: Just Pat, OOzing, Pubic Housing, WIPOS, WHO, Donkey Punch, Basket and Virgin Just Chris (?) Rusty was not there as he was enjoying a Captain's Daughter in his dry home. 'Pathetic!'<br/>Hare: (a secret) Hairy K<br/><br/>
The Hare arrived at the start during a driving rain. He was returning after resetting (so he said) the run and dropping off the Beer Stop. Instructions were given for his virgin, with a comment that the Beer would be found 20 feet from the B. NO Fancy Marks (ie: BVN, CB 69. YBF, etc.) so it should be straight forward, ya'd think. But this is Hairy and he's like a box of chocolates, if you know what I mean. I had sent him a few texts earlier in the day asking about his trail, and one comment surprised me, but I took it as a joke. I told him I hoped his marks held up in the rain, and he replied, "What Marks?", an ominous sign if I ever saw one.<br/><br/>At 6:30 the pack started out from the back of the Premier Roll & Tool parking lot, and found a few dabs of flour on trees as the trail wandered over a rocky, sopping wet, bushwhack that was sure to trip someone. We worked our way out to a check where the marks found were few and far between. Seeing the dual-power lines ahead of me, I left the wandering pack and went straight and then, not finding flour, I continued straight for some time, thinking that even if I was not on trail, I may be eventually. At the top of the first rise, about a quarter mile on, I spotted what was left of a itty bitty dopple of flour on a pebble and I called the pack OnOn. Donkey and Just Chris were soon on my ass and passed me like I was walking...and I was. We continued straight on. The rain was still falling very hard and had washed away any hope of finding the marks that the Hare said he'd reset. Eventually DP found a check and continued straight despite not finding any marks until we hit Landy Ave. Still finding no marks, we crossed the road and continued straight on the PL going north. This was the theme we'd have for most of the night. After a bit, Donkey found a check and he went straight. I went left and after some searching I found nothing. "Surprise!". Donkey was luckier and called 'OnOn!", bringing the pack with him. I stayed on the lower powerline trail and ran parallel with them, watching their lights reflect off the "No Trespassing" signs on the power line poles above me. I searched at a number of spots for an opportunity to cross over, but the brush was too thick to get through, so I continued on and on and on, without seeing a mark. <br/><br/>Eventually, miles later, I found a connecting path and met Just Chris looking for flour at a check, we went straight for some time, until we heard someone calling OnOn behind us.Traveling back, we found fresh flour marks leading into N. Attleboro WWII Memorial Park and passed some frisbee golf stations, the old water tower, a cave route through a boulder mound and then we struggled finding marks again, I was alone and bushwhacking following PH calling OnOn far beyond me. Soon we were back on the PL going south now and they found the Beer Stop. It was exactly where I had been 2 miles ago when I went off trail and alone on the lower trail. The only mark was a very large B off the gravel and I had missed it so very long ago. <br/><br/>Songs sung and beer & orange food enjoyed, we started out once again. It was a short trip back to the start, and the rain was now down to a light drizzle. The ratings were expectedly poor and as only the Virgin saying he'd enjoyed the experience, it was rated a negative zero. Hairy drank for his punishment and sang the "Foreskin" song. He was also a BackSlider, so he drank again and led the pack in "Barcellona". The Virgin paid a price and sang a sea chanty. Next was Hashit and it fell on me. I sang "Put on your old grey bustle" and drank for the good of the Hash. Then WHO, OOzing, JP and I went to the old Barrett's Ale House now Towne Tavern for a beer and samich. The rain overall was somewhat less than Ass Quack's Hash a few weeks ago, but the drive home tonight was so much more pleasant. In the words of our missing Irishman, "On On till the beer runs dry."
