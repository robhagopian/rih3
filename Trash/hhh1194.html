Pond in the Big River Management area. Although clear, ice was plentiful. As 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> soon found out, heading northeast and downhill. 
Trail turned southeast, then northeast again, then north along the shore of Tarbox Pond.<SPAN

well north of the pond. A check led to a turn back south, and <FONT

took an unnecessary northeast loop on ridge to trail heading southwest along 
Carr Pond Ridge. It then found the dirt road which led west back to the cars. 
Circling up, the ratings began as DP/PH showed up via the road. Ratings were 
influenced by the creative use of the figure 8 trail, the spectacular bruise 
that was evolving on <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish’s</FONT> posterior, the ice 
shiggy and the loss of two on trail. But, the lack of virgin territory, the loss 
of the only bimbo, and the presence of <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> at the beer check was telling. Total: -0.69. 
Hashit to <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>. I'm sure he deserved it.
