<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Back to summaries, as the memories just aren’t all that memorable. A Bondo A-to-B rehash through Woonsocket, to 
Blackstone.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> got lost. The hare made little visible effort. What more needs to be 
said?</p>

<p>Allright! Maybe a little more can be squeezed out of this lemon of a hash. Trail started from Chez Bondo and turned 
northwest on Woodland, then northeast on Gaskill. As usual, marks led left, back uphill on Warner to the entry in the 
woods. So far <font color="#FF0000">Async, WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>led, and facing the 
uphill turn, <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> decided to get creative, 
guaranteeing their loss of trail.</p>

<p>The trail was well-marked and familiar: northeast on the RR Grade, crossing Farm Road, and entering a sand-and-gravel 
pit/excavation just north of a new housing development. The hare’s pathetic trail marks tried to convince them for the 
seventeenth time to cross some water, but it was too obvious, and they all went around. There were some nice paths up 
above the pits, but the hare had not wanted to go uphill more than he had to, so they were wasted. <font color="#FF0000">
Async, WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>were alone. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows what they 
were doing!</p>

<p>They turned slightly west of north and climbed the eastern ridge of the excavations until trail died out. A brief 
backtrack by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> found the trail bushwhacking 
through the woods along the Old Mill Stream.  <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>followed on the comfortable path above, 
following the sounds of profanities from along the steep slopes.</p>

<p>Finally, they emerged, crossed the road and entered a small park at Forge Pond. The hare’s truck was visible, and 
they joined the hare at the beer check with little fuss. Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Tinker </font>and 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> were alone.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> can guess what they were doing!</p>

<p>After a few beers, the hare drove them back home, and went right back out on a rescue mission. A case can be made 
for rescuing  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, but <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>?  Naturally at the circle, 
the hare would have to pay! All together at last, the circle was joined and the run rated. The fortunate circumstance 
of losing half the hash was the only good point, but it proved deciding: +0.69! Hashit to the hare, of course. After 
religion, the evening was warm enough for outdoor dining. Things brightened up considerably as <font color="#FF0000">
Just Big Sh*t</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font> provided a fine meal to try and make up to the hash for 
their spouses. Thanks to them, and next time, perhaps you can steal their car keys!</p>
