<p><font color="#0000ff">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The run was absolutely superb.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was cursing, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi 
Boner </font>was late, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was trying to sprint in front of everyone and all others 
worked up a sweat trying to figure out where <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font> &amp; <font color="#FF0000">Tree 
House</font> were sending them.&nbsp; They were in Borrrington for God's sake, a dry town, no bars, no naked women or men 
(at this time of night anyway), <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>wouldn't even show up he is so afraid of the 
Barrington police finding out about this other life he leads in the RIH3...but <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready </font>did 
it again.&nbsp; With the help of <font color="#FF0000">Tree House</font>, she set one of the best hashes of the year, 
of course it will be voted best Beer Check of the year, hands down.&nbsp; They ran through the streets, down the rivers, 
in the muddy water, through a school yard and back through the woods behind all those pristine neighborhoods to find the 
beer check on through the pussy willows&nbsp;under a tree on a muddy island.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were on the Palmer River 
soaking up the crabs in our shoes, the bugs on&nbsp;our skin and the poison ivy crawling and spreading on our legs.&nbsp;
&nbsp; Everyone was full of smiles, maybe from the spreading of the legs or the jumping up and down by the bimbos, we are 
not sure....</p>

<p>After our incredible beer check, wonderful singing, bugle sounds and laughter because we had lost <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had never shown...we proceeded back through the forest to the On In at 
the home of <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font> &amp;<font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>.&nbsp; What did we find?&nbsp; 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner </font>curled up on the front lawn crying out in pain from a twisted ankle (you guys 
just can't keep up with the tough trails these bimbos set!!) and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> sneaking beer in this 
Borrrrington back yard.</p>

<p>We circled up around the kids turtle swimming pool - sand box and scared all the neighbors with more singing. <font 
color="#FF0000">Ever Readys'</font> kids even got to witness some of the&nbsp;great songs from the group as well as&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>with the hashit around his neck, then <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>with the 
hashit around his neck, then <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font> with the hashit for his ankle...who knows who 
ended up with the @#@ thing...I don't remember........</p>

<p>The final shock came with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> asking <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready </font>for her 
recipe for spaghetti pie...have we all become this domesticated...we better get back to Marks, Matts, or Morts whatever 
the name of the bar in West Greenwich is soon!</p>
