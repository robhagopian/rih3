<p>Well, getting there was pretty much as difficult as the trail, exit 6 (not 6a) then turn here for 5 miles, turn there 
for 5 miles etc...I had to leave the pristine fields of Borrington for this ride and without the 'ride' before from KNO 
... I had my doubts before we even started...</p>

<p>Then of course, I was late.&nbsp; No, not that kind of late, believe me, those lessons have been learned ... you've all 
seen the procreation results in our crowded house, but late for the beginning of the trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea 
where the start was, so Mr. Peabody and I set out for a 'lovely run' through the woods of Coventry.&nbsp; We were following 
some trail on this nice evening when I hear breathing from behind (did <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> find his way??), 
oh no, it is <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font>.&nbsp; Running up behind me saying &quot;I'm so F**ing hungover, 
where is the trail?&quot;.&nbsp; You know he was hungover if he is asking me where the trail was.&nbsp; All RI hashers 
know <font color="#FF0000">ERSEESB</font> just runs (or walks or wades) and follows voices and horn sounds.&nbsp; Marks 
mean nothing, flour is a bonus and toilet paper is a godsend in the woods ... </p>

<p>We followed the arrows, walked over streams, checked for ticks (that was fun) and then hearing the sound of voices 
realized ...!&nbsp; We've back tracked!&nbsp; Here were <font color="#FF0000">B*tch X 7, Oozing,&nbsp;Ben, WIPOS, Virgin 
Jean Paul&nbsp;</font>&amp;<font color="#FF0000"> Dr. Who</font> across the stream.&nbsp; You've missed the beer check 
they yell, where are the marks&nbsp;they ask, once again &quot;why are you asking me?&quot; ... </p>

<p>The beer check was found after we all praised <font color="#FF0000">B*tchX7</font> for losing <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>, Seamus &amp; <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> and somersaulted down under the bridge and waded through 
the river to find the beer under water ... <font color="#FF0000">Swallows</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Virgin 
Ian</font> found us enjoying the water and singing out loudly that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had still not found 
us (although <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>&amp; Seamus had) ... Mr. Peabody would not enjoy the water with us (he 
was pacing back &amp; forth trying to find a way across the river without getting wet).&nbsp; But as everyone found trail 
across the river I had to carry Mr. Peabutt back up to the bridge so that his tender paws did not touch the dirty river ... 
I somehow once again found my way through the bushwhacking, did not cross any water but found the toilet paper and <font 
color="#FF0000">Swallows </font>with both virgins, <font color="#FF0000">Ian</font> &amp; <font color="#FF0000">Jean 
Paul.</font></p>

<p>At the end before the circle we found <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> &amp; Jake with his military man friend <font color="#FF0000">Squirrel Dick </font>or <font color="#FF0000">Sergeant Squirrel </font>(whatever he wants to call 
himself) and some dead fish.&nbsp; We circled up, hazed the virgins, listened to <font color="#FF0000">Summer's Eve 7 Year 
Bitch </font>&amp; <font color="#FF0000">Swallows'</font> rendition of a new hash song, made fun of <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> and his dead fish, praised <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> for being intelligent enough to stay at work 
and miss this hash (which received a +6.9 rating) and gave the hashit back to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for collecting the most I'd a Ho map thingies...</p>

<p>ON In was at our favorite joint, Mark's or Mikes or exit 6 or 6a ... and&nbsp;both virgins claim they will be back ... 
that is yet to&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;... I at least got to go home to get <font color="#FF0000">KNO'ed</font> ...</p>
