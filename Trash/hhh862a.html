occupation in Times Square after she exhausted the &quot;other&quot; oldest proffesion in

Fwaqngi Boner-altho' methinks(no this will not turn into a <font color="#FF0000">
DrWHO</font>/Shakespeare penned diatribe) came to the run and is still looking 
for marks and has now drifted over to Connecticut where he believes the chicken 
wings are from real chickens; and Tinker who is busy laying another long trail 
and so had no time for a run; and as for PW-well, he actually drove out of 
Wickford last week, hit 95 south and kept driving. Rumour has it he's still 
driving down south in search for a bigger dig.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Start:</font> off 44W before Cady's Tavern.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font> it was during this 
week in Nov in the year 1805 that the &quot;Corps of Discovery&quot; completed their 8000 
mile journey. Their mission was threefold:1. find the NW passage, 2: announce 
American sovereignty to the natives in the midwest and 3: to document the 
unknown flora and fauna.</p>

<p>To commemorate this achievment, <font color="#FF0000">
Async </font>embarked on his own journey, dropping flour before, delirious with 
thirst and disoriented, he forgot to do this but forged on into unchartered 
territory. He chose the town of Glosta' for the momentous hash, and HIS mission 
too was threefold: 1: set an 8 mile long run with as little marks as possible; 
2:prove to all that despite his bad back, he would still make your calf muscles 
throb and ruin your favourite little bank; and 3: well, by this time he also 
forgot that there was a third mission. Or was it a solemn promise that you would 
BLEED? And one of us did just that.</p>

<p>During the hash, not only was their virgin territory 
traversed, but the natives bore witness to a running pack of aging old men and 
lil' red riding hood behind them, they swore never to venture out on a Monday 
night again. And so began the dreary tradition of Monday Night Football. And 
there was plenty of heretofore never seen flora on the run-and lots of hard 
black surface the hash never encountered before.</p>

<p>The d'erections to the start were perfect. Well yes, if 
you were driving in 2 in the afternoon on a brightly lit highway. As it was 
pitch dark and no lights, most of us overshot the start, bringing
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> flashbacks of his premature ejaculation 
woes, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> of his wayward and hesitant pee 
stream due to an over healthy prostate gland-which mind you happens to be the 
only funtional gland in that gluttonous body of his. Nevertheless, one by on, 
the hash faithful arrived at the start. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
signaled the start promptly at 630pm, and the pack headed (who said?) southwards 
a good 200 meters before encountering flour. This would be a recurring theme for 
the night. <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> led the pack and off into 
the woods and soon bushwhacking thru woods and stream. Had <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> miscalculated the GPS d'erections, or more plausibly, was he 
running from the hunters here to shoot the vicious Durfee deer? Aided by the 
hare, the pack soon came back on trail and headed south again, the west and 
northerly to the lake. Here the hash suffered its first casualty. Bondo kept 
going around the lake oblivious to the dearth of marks and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>followed him. The rest of the pack faithfully navigated the trail, 
going thru checks, then coming out onto a road. After a setback, the pack soon 
found trail again heading north on the NS trail. A definite
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> favorite. Back out on the road, the pack 
headed north on tarmac and hit 44.</p>

<p>The warm light of Cady's beckoned. But the pack, so sure 
they would yet find some semblance of well laid trail, forged east and onto a 
false trail that took the pack into GW State park. <font color="#FF0000">The 
Slasher</font> however, knowing better, went down Durfee road and soon came upon 
trail. The pack, together again, were surprised now to find flour marks that 
almost looked new. It was as if the hare had run backwards to reset the last 3rd 
of the trail. This may have been the obvious conclusion was it not for his bad 
back that would have precluded him from doing so. Maybe Allah had heard his 
flock? Towards a distant strobe the pack ran, and in so doing heard a low drone 
growing louder and louder. At first, each in the pack thought the hasher in 
front was letting out low frequency farts, but soon <font color="#FF0000">
Basket's</font> cries of ON ON were unmistakable. Or was it Jake howling as
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> mercilessly buggered him? The early arrivals 
had a fire going at the BC, and the pack warmed and drank from Nature's nectar.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> obviously inebriated but confused by the 
distant strobe and unable to believe his luck being in the presence of the great
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>-felt as if he was the Lord himself and 
proceeded to walk on water. Hmmm.....</p>

<p>The beer consumed, the pack ran back to the start. The 
circle ensued. The pack unanimously regretted-despite the invention of synthetic 
rubber on 11/03/1931-<font color="#FF0000">Async's</font> father forgot to put 
it on! A minus 6.9 was the overall mark. The RIH3 is known the world over for 
its graciousness.</p>

<p>ONON at Cadys and beer and pizza was consumed by all. Oh, 
and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail SYBSE</font> 
were awarded the hashit cojointly for their dirty, bloody little secret.</p>
