Run #1661: First Ski Hash of the Year<br/>
Date: Jan 8, 2018<br/>
Hare: OOzing<br/>
Location: Behind the Johnston Fire Station off Rte 6 West, or right in front of the fire station for some!<br/>
Hare: Oozing, just back from the land of High Roads & Low Roads.<br/>
Pack: Basket, WIPOS, Donkey, Pubic, Butt Plug, Rusty, Frosted Fanny, Pussy Galore, O'Boner, Just Pat, Turd in the Beaver, Just the Tip.<br/><br/>

Should have been a Rusty & Frosted Fanny trail but Oozie stepped up for no other reason than he wanted to set a ski hash. What?, no snow in Middletown?? Basket reached out to Rusty about changing his run date with Oozie, the suggestion was gleefully accepted.<br/><br/>

The pack was looking slim as we found parking at the entrance to Snake Den, everyone had read the instructions, it was going to be the first ski hash of the year. Bring ski's or snowshoes. Just Pat brought neither and danced his merry way around the trail on foot. The rest of us donned the gear and listened to chalk talk, there was about as much talk as there was flour on trail.<br/><br/>

We set out promptly 15 minutes late, heading North into the woods. It was difficult to see the non-marks and we spread out trying to find a way to go. Trail led us to the "big field" and a check, at this point the pack went skiing and snow shoeing in multiple directions, Donkey was heard shouting an OnOn but this soon came to an end when another check was found and trail became invisible again. Pubic headed back into the big field making reference to the hare having previously laid a beer stop "just over there". Alas, trail did not go that way, the pack was now even more split up than previously noted. Another check was found, this one was in an area that had a circle of trails which made checking difficult. On returning to the check, because of the failure to find flour, we were confused about which ways we had checked. PG led the pack for a brief moment followed by O'Boner and FF, again wrong way.<br/><br/>

The Tip and The Turd were FRB's but very quiet ones, they never marked checks so the sorry ass back markers had to search for trail at every check. A muttering of voices was heard in the woods up ahead, no sign of lights which meant that this was surely a beer stop. Cans of Harpoon were available as was some other stuff, orange food was fake Oreos and peanuts, a welcome nibble for all. We sang until there was only one beer left and then we set out in the direction advised by the hare, at this very same moment Donkey and Butt Plug took those instructions to mean the exact opposite way. WIPOS was confused, started taking pictures of trees and things and then he headed off in another direction.<br/><br/>

Reports from those skiing said it was grand, those on snow shoes had fun too as the snow was soft and fluffy to the side of the ski trail. Overall, we covered just under tree miles. Circle was formed in the woods, no birthdays let alone two people with the same birthday. The run was given a positive 6.9. Hashit went to Just Pat in a moment that was typical of hash circles, the nomination came from Basket as he mentioned that someone had pulled into the driveway of the fire station and was looking directly at the doors of said station. Just Pat said O'Crap that was me and walked himself into the circle to accept the award. Little did he know that he wasn't the only one that did it & the intended one got away without the hashit. Moral of the story, keep yer mouth shut & don't sacrifice yourself for anything until your name is mentioned.<br/><br/>

The on-after was at Bishop's Hill where we gorged ourselves on burgers and other drab stuff. We drank fake Dogfish 60 minute and we could only pick from pages 1 & 2 of the menu because it was after 9pm. We protested this since it was only 8:54pm, that fell on deaf ears as did the complaining about the Dogfish. Just Molly was served up a plate of cooked bacon, she was happy.
