<p><font color="#008000">Run #986</font>, Feb 28, 2005.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Async</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Cady’s, Glocester.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 20’s, windy, snowing.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy, Dr WHO, Oozing SD, SESYB, Basket Boom Boom, 
Bondo Jovi, Beyond Hope, Ben, Seamus.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>For the last night of restaurant smoking in the state of Rhode Island, the hare chose his locale based upon the 
local eatery, rather than upon the quality of the trail. This was understandable. How could this run not end up at 
Cady’s, the grungiest, smelliest, smokiest bar in the northeast. Predicted snow was holding off, so the usual group 
showed up on time to smell the fumes from the bar as well as from a tractor-trailer rig with its engine on in the 
parking lot. The hare gave instructions and they were off.</p>

<p>They ran east on 44 to the first mark which turned them north past some boulders into the woods on a path. 
Trail gradually turned, and joined the George Washington Management area’s network of trails. No surprises for the 
hashers, but as they emerged on the Area’s access Road, there were plenty of surprises for a group of confused  snowmobilers. They were packing it in for the evening, ready to go light a few up at Cady’s no doubt, when the 
unruly hashers, led by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> burst out 
to the check mark on the road.</p>

<p>After a great deal of chaos, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> found trail briefly north on the road, 
and then turning west to the shoreline trail. This well-used and remembered path includes the red, blue and orange 
trails as well as the North-South Trail! They ran along the edges of the partly-thawed Wilbur Pond, and were spreading 
out when a check sent them in all different directions. But finally <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> found marks on a secondary trail north to the Center trail. It was but a short jaunt 
from there to one of the camping shelters and the Beer Check.</p>

<p>The snow was now starting, and after a brief stop for a beer, they soon headed on out, south on the orange trail. 
There were few checks, and they all managed to stay together back to the second shelter, this one close to the 
Bowdish reservoir, where the hare had set the circle. The hare had planned a fire, and he and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> went off to search for the cache of wood. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (woodsman 
extraordinaire, sometimes known as the “Last of the BOHICAns”*) was well-prepared to start a fire in the now rapidly 
falling snow. He had a starter log, a cube of nuclear fuel and a bottle of lighter fluid. Even so, it was some time 
before the fire was blazing and the circle could be started. Ratings for the run: no virgin territory, unnecessary 
use of the North-South trail, no one lost, no second or third degree burns on <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> vs 
active snowfall, confused snowmobilers, bonfire, short trail. Total: 0.69. Hashit: <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, in absentia. They lingered for a short while to enjoy the fire, but the sight of 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> attempting to set his posterior ablaze was too much, and they headed out the 
access road, and crossed 44 to Cady’s.</p>

<p>Cady’s lived up to all expectations: a drunken and rowdy trucker (whose rig was still spewing out diesel fumes in 
the parking lot) falling all over the floor, determined chain-smokers at the bar and the pool table, and 
cheeseburgers which must have been cooked over a cube of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> nuclear fuel as they 
were burnt so black as to be almost inedible. To cap it all off, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> 
decided to spend $7 to buy a pack of Newport Lights (?) for the table, so they all lit up to savor the moment. 
<font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>even decided to remove the filters. It 
was pathetic. At last, the group made their way out into the driving snow, and very slowly made their ways back to 
their respective homes, reliving the evening from the smoky stench of their clothes on the way.</p>
