<P><font color="#0000ff">The Run:<BR> </font><FONT 
color=#000000>The run for 
Memorial Day, 2008 was anything but memorable. In fact, I can remember virtually 
nothing about it. But the hare has website privileges, and if he doesn't like 
this, he is more than welcome to edit, add, subtract, or falsify what little I 
can remember. I did keep a list of attendees, so at least that much is accurate. 
(Right!)&nbsp;And when in doubt, I always give <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>           
             
               
               
             
  hashit in these writeups, so I've got that covered as well. No one 
reads these damn things anyways, except perhaps a few newbies looking for ideas 
for their first haring. I bet they won't get any good ideas from this one! So 
quit yer bellyachin' and go back to surfing net porn!<BR><BR>The start was at a dirt parking area off Buck Hill Road 
almost at the Connecticut border. A sizeable crowd of men were present; the few 
women participants in our hash being too wise to trek up all this way, 
especially knowing that <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> would be getting naked 
in his pool afterwards. And what kind of knucklehead would show up for this kind 
of abuse? Just about every active knucklehead in the RIH3. And visitors and a 
virgin who couldn't have known better.Except of course for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Friar Fuck</FONT>     
             
              
              
              
             
             
, who may in fact have no sensory apparatus whatsoever as far as we can 
tell. Promptly at 2 PM, they were off. Trail led north into the management area. 
<BR><BR>The visitors, being young and fit were soon leading the 
pack. Trail was mostly on paths, and through fields.&nbsp;There were several 
annoying checks leading to loops that could easily be avoided. (This was to 
allow <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> to keep up. To no avail, however as he 
was soon lost.) <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> too, had ideas (a dangerous 
thing). He acted quickly and headed for the Tri-State marker. Luckily the 
visitors heeded <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing's</FONT> warnings and didn't follow. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>             
          
               
               
            
         was convinced that 
the trail would come out on Wallum Lake and as such, always checked right. This 
was usually wrong.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>   managed to keep up with the athletes 
as the hare slowly but surely shepherded them in a clockwise loop to the Beer 
Check. Was there a beer check? There must have been, because if there hadn't 
been, the memory of that outrage would have stuck with me. But it couldn't have 
been a scenic stop on the lake with a swim, good beer and snacks, as I would 
also have remembered that. No, it must have been some non-descript rock in the 
middle of the woods or something. Yawn!<BR><BR><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Beer check dispensed with, trail back was probably 
straightfoward and wouldn't deserve description anyways. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> were found at 
some point, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> doubtless regaled the group 
with tales&nbsp;of his adventures. Double Yawn!! The group drove back to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket's</FONT> abode for the circle. It might have been in the 
pool, but I doubt it. The water was pretty damn cold, back in May.The run was 
rated. &nbsp;No shiggy, no bimbos, and a beercheck that people were EVEN THEN 
beginning to forget! Total (artificially inflated by the presence of visitors 
who didn't know better): +0.0! The virgin probably came into the circle. He 
probably didn't have a song, and so told a lame joke. Perhaps that's why we 
haven't seem HIM again! <FONT color=#ff0000>Friar Fuck</FONT> probably did have 
a song. Bad luck for us! Hashit: <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>! Told you so. 
And the evening was finished with a potluck dinner thanks to the charity and 
kindness of the long suffering <FONT color=#ff0000>Dogmeat</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>JBS</FONT>
