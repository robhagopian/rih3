<font color="#3333FF"><i>Present:</i> </font><font color="#3333FF"> </font><font color="#FF0000">Dr
WHO Slasher, Async</font>, visitor from Kuala Lumpur<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Tumbling Bill, Bondo, ShineOn,</font> the navy ie. <font color="#FF0000">Cumonya</font>,
<font color="#FF0000">Just Brian</font> (yet unnamed<br>
by RIH3),and <font color="#FF0000">Just John</font>, your scribe <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and the latecummer <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, not<br>
too forget the 3 hounds Jake, Ben and Baxter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hare <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> chose
this godforsaken place near the Ct. border (Wickaboxet Mgt Area) and so many
were late. The pack soon set off and stayed on trail that was marked in white
flour which showed quite well despite the snow!&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
was FRB and made true trail thru the first two checks but blew it at the third
check but chose not to venture back and so was not seen/heard of ontil the end
of the run.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Meanwhile the pack headed up and down a hill thru
two checks until the were taken by the classic <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
move ie. a false trail after 50 odd marks. Slowly back to the last check and <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
horn was heard in the distance as the pack looped what seemed to be back to the
start down a long trail and to the BC. After searching for hours the hare chose
to tell us where the beer was located and singing ensued.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000">Tumbling Bill</font> shared
his life's venture with us ie. to complete the hash genealogy and with much
authority informed a dismayed <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> that the BH3
was not America's oldest hash. After the beer and warm fire the pack went back
to the start of the run with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> already in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;As <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
fought over who stole their respective beers, the circle gathered with down
downs to the hare for a, per <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, a lovely hash,
the visitor and the combined hashit <font color="#FF0000">Async/WIPOS</font>
altho again the true hashit was missing with <font color="#FF0000">WIPOs</font>
attempting to squeeze in his toilet seat again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The ONON was at the upscale West Greenwich
Inn altho anything but Cadys is upscale for this hairy bunch. Beer and food was
ordered and somebody switched <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> beer for diet
coke. Soon the Rhody hash showed its maturity to the visitor who had earlier
claimed us as being 2nd generation (Sparks having ran with the original hash),
by having a food fight with <font color="#FF0000">ShineOn</font> throwing
ketchup on scribe's hair and getting vinegar mistaken for diet coke on her face!
Before we could be thrown out the bunch hi-hoed its way out...until next week!</font></p>
