color=#000000>The run started from a small office strip “100ft” before “Sticks” 
on Rt 44. Promptly at 6:30, they were off, across Rt 44 and into some light 
shiggy. They bushwhacked to a logging road south, and gradually curved west. 
There were few checks, but there also were few marks, keeping the hash pretty 
much together. Only<FONT color=#ff0000> Bondo</FONT> managed to get

color=#000000>Crossing Hunt Brook, they entered the backside of Heritage Park. 
Some confusion in some pine groves had to be solved, but before they knew it, 
they all found the hare and the Beer Check.All except for Bondo, that is. There 
was great rejoicing. The beer and the songs began. Once finished, the hare 
instructed them to retrace their steps, and to take a left at the “diagonal 
tree”. <o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

meandered for a while, getting more and more lost, until someone recognized the

color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> at least knew enough to follow this to Chestnut Oak 
Road, where they made their exit and settled down to the long hard pavement 
back. (It was made somewhat longer and harder for themselves by <FONT

passed. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> would be stupid enough to do

sign of the hare (A Yahoo!! Modified only by the realization that he had the 
rest of the beer). Finally, <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> got into his car 
to see if he could rescue the hare, lost on his own trail. He soon came back, 
and the circle was begun, behind the Post Office (a Federal offense, no 
doubt.)<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Comments on the run. No <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> at the 
BC, one bimbo, some shiggy and two stream crossing were plusses. The way in was 
fine and dandy, but the way back! The reality of having to choose miles of 
pavement, versus getting lost with the hare and Basket led to the ultimate 
score: -6.9! Hashit went from <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> to <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, and somehow 
ended up with <FONT color=#ff0000>Shemale Man</FONT>. Go figure. The On On On 
was at Chesters, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> didn’t get arrested, 
this time. There’s always something good to be said about any Monday night in 
Rhode Island.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
