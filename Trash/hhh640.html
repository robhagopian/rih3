<P><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">The Start:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Park n' Save, Woosocket</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT COLOR="#000099">Bondo always promises something, maybe not what
you wanted, but like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re going
to get.&nbsp; Bondo always told me that.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000099">The Hare, Bondo Jovi, called the hound to wait
at the Park N Shop in Blackstone for his last hash of Summer.&nbsp; Faithful
hashers Async, WIPOS, RIPTA, Tinker (bell), Oozing Syph, Shine On HM, and
Basket were joined by the unfaithful ones Dog Meat, and Strokes His NightStick,
not as unfaithful but not one to be found hashing on a regular bases Little
Neck, and late cumer Cheap Licker in the yet to unfold story of adventure..as
every Bondo hash may be.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000099">We waited for Cheep Licker for about 10 minutes,
and finally the “Impatient One”, Bondo, call all to d’Erections.&nbsp;
This was to be a B to A, and for those unfamiliar with that...so were we.&nbsp;
It seems Bondo was to drive us to the start.&nbsp; We sang merrily along,
when we should have been watching the drive or at least the driver, because
when we finally arrived, we didn’t know where the hell we were.&nbsp; The
hare dropped us off in the wonderful town of Millville, famous for it’s
tough peacekeepers and the town that almost locked up Lurch for running
along it’s tracks in a suit with a bag of white powder.&nbsp; Now Lurch
is City Planner for the adjoining city.&nbsp; The largest in these neck
of the woods and third in the state, but we were not in Rhode Island and
they don’t really give a shit about us over the line.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000099">But I degress...the trail led along a long since
forgotten section of rail bed, that would have been the third rail service
into this busy center of the industrial revolution.&nbsp; Back when the
Blackstone River was the hardest working river in the US of A, and Sam
Slater had started the bustling enterprise along with his brother John
in Slatersville, another bustling center except that now Basket doesn’t
work there anymore, and it isn’t the 1700’s.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000099">But I degress...We followed the bed and it’s adjoining
tracks laid by the Providence &amp; Worcester Rail Road, and very close
to the banks of that miricle river the Blackstone.&nbsp; We came up field,
and then woodland, and finally the river lay before us.&nbsp; We couldn’t
go around it.&nbsp; We couldn’t go over it.&nbsp; So we went through it,
throught it, through it.&nbsp; On the far side stood Bondo the bastard
hare, Tinker the dry foot fairy, and Cheap Licker the late but never too.&nbsp;
Async was first to cross with Nightstick Charlie close up his behind, followed
by the aprehensive Oozing, followed by the careful WIPOS, followed by the
smiling RIPTA (who loves getting wet, but never cums), followed by the
cautious Dog Meat who complained very emphatically about not being informed
by her husband of the ensuing wet trail and she not bringing dry clothing,
and eventually by the extremely careful and yet most delicate stepping
the Sober One (3 Years) Shine On holding onto Baskets strong yet delicate
hands.</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000099">A beer stop was found at the height of the Blackstone
Gorge, and all embibed ‘cept Basket who insisted the water route was the
most sceenic if not exciting way to the Beer.&nbsp; A few songs were sung,
including “Why are we waiting. Asshole?” to Basket, and we bottomed up
for the remainder of trail.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000099">Some were convince by Bondo to follow him to
the Bondo Mobil and drive in, but the more adventurous including Async,
Cheap Licker, Oozing, and Basket ran along the waters path.&nbsp; Not being
familar with this direction, they soon found themselves trapped in by high
walls and fencing.&nbsp; No so easily discouraged, the mounted the wall,
scalled the fence and even clung tenachously to the canal embankment as
they forged new trail and adventure.&nbsp; Making their was out to Main
Street Blackstone, they were running along towards the end and the lazy
fat putred bastards in Bondo’s van shouted obsenities as the drove past.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000099">We made it in, and drove over to Bondo’s for,
as always, good beer and food.&nbsp; Downdowns were given to all who earned
rightly or not so their just deserve, and once again Oozing found the Hashit
fit round his neck. The hash was a spetacular new venue and a good time,
as they say, was had by all.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000099">The End.</FONT>
