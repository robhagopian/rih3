would make a line longer than the actual run. And more fun, too. It’s getting 
tough to predict the numbers, and this leads to discord, discontent and lack of 
beer. But then again, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> could complain with a

color=#000000>The pack, perhaps better called a horde, was off promptly at 6:35. 
Trail led out of the parking lot south, parallel to Sylvy’s Brook. An inevitable 
check fooled no one, and they began the ascent after crossing the stream on some 
planks. No shiggy, except a little left over snow was encountered. No one got 
lost. Trail led northeast on a path to the old ski lift. It turned right and 
went up the lift path at a steep grade. Some slipped a bit on the loose rubble 
under the snow. But that’s about the only interest this trail had.

heading straight up to the summit, one looping around to the right, and one 
heading left. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> knows which was the true trail. It 
really didn’t matter. There’s not that much real estate up there. They ended up 
converging on the north ridge, where they found the hare and the beer check. 
Eighteen minutes to the beer! As the walkers straggled in, the beer shortage 
became apparent. So there was a surplus of singing. And unfortunately, these 
sounds drew the late-cummer <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> to the group. But 
as <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> says: “Outta beer? Outta 
here!”<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail back came down the actual ski slopes. That’s really all I 
can think of to say. The circle was formed, the run rated, and the bimbos saved 
the day for the hare. Total: +0! Backsliders were punished, and Hashit went to 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>. (As usual, not a clue.) Finishing up, about 
half of the group headed for Tucks. Foiled again, they wound up at the Lodge. 
Home to bed early, this Monday night.</FONT></SPAN>
