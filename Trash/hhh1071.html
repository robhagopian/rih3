<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The account of the Journey of the Magi is a significant one to the Christian religion.  And one that has, surprisingly, 
many similarities to the hash that occurred on October 9th.  Coming from the East, five (un)wise men converged underneath 
the blue neon cross of the Shepherd of the Valley United Methodist Church on the corner of Seven Mile Rd and Scituate Ave 
for what they thought would be a holy enlightenment.  Can I get an Amen!?</p>

<p>Word of this event had spread far and wide via the RIH3 webpage and included such uplifting, inspirational and 
spiritual phrases as “LIVE HARE EXTRAVAGANZA,” “not 1, not 2, but 3(!) beer checks!,” and “So Ladies….and Girls.”  Can I 
get an Amen!?  Even the pastor of the Shepherd of the Valley United Methodist Church couldn’t stay away, although after a 
quick check of our sincerity for respecting Jesus’s parking lot returned to what we can only assume was a hardcore 
training session for the Breakers Marathon.  May God provide him with fast feet.  Can I get an Amen!?</p>

<p>Just as Gaspar, Melchior and Balthasar traveled to see baby Jesus by following the Star of Bethlehem, <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> traveled towards the beer check by following the divine mark of flour on trail.  Which 
started south on Seven Mile drive taking them over Scituate Ave.  It was not far past this awe-inspiring intersection when 
the first check was encountered.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> looked towards the heavens for an answer.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> looked in the field.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> looked farther down the road.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> looked like a jackass.  Just when all hopes appeared lost <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
called on not once, not twice, but three times.  Just like the number of Magi.  Can I get an Amen!?</p>

<p>Traveling East through the well manicured fields, trail slowly curved south towards a short fence.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> lead the way like a man possessed (possessed with His spirit – can I get an AMEN!?) and the 
others followed close behind.  A check led them directly east again and shortly after, the pack crossed a small stream.  
Surprisingly not one shoe got wet – whether they walked on water or <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> somehow slipped in 
some <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> gear (without being there – it’s a miracle, can I get an Amen!?) they will never 
know.</p>

<p>Another check showed up, looking like an angle’s halo, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> went right.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> went left as if being called upon by a supreme being and did for his brethren as he wished 
they’d do for him, called “on-on” at the third mark.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and Seamus were hot on his 
heels, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> wasn’t far behind and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> stayed awful close to 
the hare.  Not too close though, as we all know how the Big JC feels about “those” kinda relationships.  Can I get an 
Amen!?</p>

<p>A few ups and downs on the nicely manicured horse trails put us at yet another check, and while <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> managed to fall into a trap by going left (kinda like the trap Herod wanted to set for the Magi so he could 
find out where baby Jesus was), <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> found true trail 
straight into a small field.  Once again, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was not to be found.  Eh, all the history 
mentions three Magi, so a 4th would really screw with this write-up.  Can I get an Amen!?</p>

<p>After the field was crossed a small path led the group into another wooded area.  One large tree lay across the trail 
(as if smote down by the hand of God!), but it was easily bypassed by leaping over or jogging around.  What’s this?  
Another check!  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> went straight, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> went left, <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> did something.  Towards the left was a deer stand, apparently used by <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> on a pervious hash in attempt to urinate on others.  This, I’m sure, was not viewed as golden love coming 
from the skies above.  With no <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and therefore no urine (can I get an Amen!?), the 
(un)wise men continued through the thick underbrush into an open clearing.</p>

<p>Another check sent <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to the right, where he swore <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
was making owl-like noises in attempt to lead him in the correct direction.  This left <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> “Basketless” (can I get an Amen!?), which unfortunately doesn’t always mean smarter 
(although this is most often the case).  Marks were seen on the perimeter of the clearing, which was later identified as a 
Christmas tree farm.  Coincidence?  Thou thinks not!  Mark after mark continued around the perimeter of the field until 
they came upon a large “X.”  This is when <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> comes into in the picture with a blow of his 
whistle.  I’d like to state that although the Bible does not number the Magi, traditionally there were always seen to be 
three, as there were three gifts given to the child.  However, the text also states that other gifts were given, making 
the number of Magi even less definite.  Therefore we’ll make <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> the fourth (un)wise 
man.</p>

<p>After joining up with <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> proceeded southward through the barren Christmas tree farm towards a main path, where <font color="#FF0000">
Dry Foot</font> was waiting.  It was almost like their joining was due to divine intervention.  Or something.  It was at 
this time the (un)wise men noted that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was missing.  Can I get an Amen!?  Unfortunately 
his horn was heard in the distance and after a few whistles and light flashes he appeared to be coming in the right 
direction.</p>

<p>The pack (minus <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>) continued lightless up the main path towards, and over, Seven Mile 
Rd to a path circling Spring Lake Reservoir.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> had started off on the live hare 
section of the trail just a bit before, and big arrows had them crossing a small dam (no, not a goddamn) back onto a trail 
making a counterclockwise circle around the reservoir.  Halfway around a BN was spotted.  Hallelujah!!  Just as the Magi 
brought baby Jesus gifts of three (gold, frankincense and myrrh), the hare brought the hash gifts of three (beer, hot nuts 
and jalapeño potato chips).  Can I get an Amen!?  The path led towards the water and ended up on a nice set of rocks 
overlooking a set of houses, one of which was attached to a rowdy dock <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> sounded like 
they’d been drinking all day.  The beer check was great – no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">
Fawangi</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, it was like our own heaven on earth.  That was until <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> light was spotted circling the water and soon enough he, and Seamus, joined us for some 
song.  Song which was sometime repeated back by those on the before mentioned rowdy dock.  Can you feel the love (the type 
of traditional love felt between a man and a woman)?</p>

<p>After the brews were downed we hopped back on trail and continued counterclockwise around the reservoir to Seven Mile 
Rd.  A right had us pointed in the direction of the cars and shortly after the blue neon cross of the Shepherd of the 
Valley United Methodist Church was spotted.  Can I get an Amen!?  Once everyone arrived we circled up in Jesus’s backyard 
with a ton of Dogfish Head brew.  The response: complaints on lack of virgin territory, complaints on dry feet, yahoos for 
no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>/<font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font>, boos for no bimbos.  Holy crap, did the 
(un)wise men think they were perfect?!!  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cares – mathematical total was <b>0.0</b>.  
Amazing, incredible, awe-inspiring.  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font>, who must think he’s better than 
the rest of us (<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> is not better than the rest of us, by the way) because he won’t show up 
to a RIH3 hash, but will hare a Newport hash.  Pathetic.  May the Big JC strike him down with a bolt of lightning.</p>

<p>The five (un)wise men then packed into their cars and (un)wisely went to the Bishop Hill Tavern to what might have been 
the most expensive on-on-on to date.  I blame <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and his need to order the last set of 
pitchers.  Food was good, wait staff was easy on the eyes and the beer flowed like wine.  And just like the Magi left 
after seeing baby Jesus, the five un(wise) men left for their own abodes.  Can I get an Amen!?</p>
