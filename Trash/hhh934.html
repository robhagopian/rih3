<p><font color="#FF0000">Finding Oozing's Beaver Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #933</font>, March 8, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Beaver River Preserve, Richmond</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather: </font>Low to Mid 30's, Snowing</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present: </font><font color="#FF0000">SESYB </font>(co-hare), <font color="#FF0000">The Slasher 
Dr WHO, Async, Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Basket Boom Boom, Seamus, Jake, Ben</font>.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The d’erections to the start were for once, clear concise and easy to follow. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>
arrived early, followed by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Async, WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. But 
there was no sign of the hare. Six-thirty was past, and the group fanned out into the woods looking for marks. Finally, 
they headed up Fox Ridge Road, where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> discovered the hare and cohare smooching in 
their car. (And maybe more, but he’s not talking.) The hare could not even follow his own d’erections. Come on! Even
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>could! The group drove up to the hare’s parking place at the other end of Fox Ridge 
road, and began the hash at 7:15, nearly breaking the <font color="#FF0000">Raging Queen’s</font> record start time at 
Great Swamp.</p>

<p>Trail lead north into the Beaver River Preserve. A check mark scattered the group, and the hare and cohare had to call 
them back to head east on some small paths. Several small brooks were crossed on plankways, and footprints in the falling 
snow made this easy until they started to bushwhack. Trail became obscure and the hare had to give some hints until he too 
became lost while crossing the Beaver River.</p>

<p>It would have been comical if it had not been so pathetic. Hare and cohare led through a maze of bushes and briars. Any 
footprints to be seen were obscured by the dogs and wandering hashers. The eastern side of the river was followed until at 
last the hare found the path. This led to a deep bog overflowing the path, and they indicated that trail went forward. 
Surprisingly quiet, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> led the way.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> followed. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> whined. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> held 
back, and tried without success to find an alternate route that did not involve thigh deep water. He did find some thorns.
</p>

<p>Climbing a hill on the far side of the bog, the BC was found. Beer was enjoyed, especially while following the tortured 
progress of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> in the briar patch on the other side of the bog. Trail back was 
straightforward. North, then west crossing the river on plankways again, and then turning back south to the entrance.</p>

<p>The circle was held just inside the Preserve entrance. Ratings were obviously reflective of the brilliance of the run. 
The d’erections alone were worth a 69! (Maybe that’s what was going on at the “start” in the hare’s car while they waited 
for the hashers to arrive!) Snowing, bog crossing, hare-loss on trail, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> in the thorns. 
Total: 6.9! Hashit: who but <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, for substantial whining.</p>

<p>On On On they went to Mark’s at exit 6 not 6A for another ending to another wasted evening in the poor and wretched 
lives of the members of the RIH3. But <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> wouldn’t be delighted to be a part of this? <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> keeps showing up, week after week? And <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> keeps doing these 
stupid write-ups, God knows why!</p>
