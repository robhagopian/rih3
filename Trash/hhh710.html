<BR>&nbsp;<P><font face="Arial" size="3">The return of the great <font color="#FF0000">Snot</font>
last week and his nomination of Grand Master lifted back up the quality of runs
for the best Hash in the world. The runs had been getting worse the standard of
checks had reached toilet level. This run the last before Christmas finally
reached new heights and put RI back on the map, the subsidiary Boston Hash could
only provide one runner (<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>) renamed
Trail Mix by RI Mother Hash. The others we are told had a party and could not
hold their liquor, what a pile of whimps, you Boston girls call yourselves
Hashers!</font><P align="center"><img border="0" src="groupxmas.jpg" width="528" height="396">
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the start waiting for the off was <font color="#FF0000">Async,
Beyond Hope, Red Snapper (AKA Furgie), Little Neck, Oozing, Trail Hoover, Bondo,
Jake, Ben (New boots) </font>and the inevitable hares <font color="#FF0000">Snot
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. The run began from Ryan’s
place and went into woods with all the front runners catching all the false
trails, which were ‘brilliantly’ marked according to the front runners. The
quality of the run was marked by early entry into briar – courtesy of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> was leading the pack from the very start
and has not lost any of his energy. We all noticed he ran faster when<font color="#FF0000">
Furgie</font> mentioned the ‘V’ word.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font>,
they only snip your tubes not cut your balls off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Over the bridge some more falsies which <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> fell for but <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font>
was still out there blazing trail. At this point as you would expect <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
was at the back hoping to pick up some short cuts, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
was three parts pissed after hoovering down three pints of 10% Scotch ale prior
to the start. With the hares knowing what was to come allowed one short cut for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.
Around the pit up through an old works, and into woods with some virgin trail
being run, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was the only asshole to run both
falsies before getting back on trail. I think <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
is in training for when he is called up for Pakistan to invade India, or could
be so he can be first out of Pakistan when India kick Pakistan’s butt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On up to the beer with guess who at the back <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Furgie</font> who was explaining to<font color="#FF0000">
Bondo </font>how fit she was, - NOT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong beer at the mid
point with squawks of too easy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wankers, they still had no idea how
wet they were going to get. Songs finished beer sucked, part two to come, one
off the best parts was tunnel under the road which was avoided by all you
Wankers except <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> who thought he was chasing
Pakistani’s in the Vietnam war. The skinny runt was through like shit through
a goose.&nbsp;&nbsp; We think <font color="#FF0000">Furgie </font>gave it a try
but could not get both her tits through the opening.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">For the only runner from Boston Trail Hoover,
ploughed on valiantly, although she had to take twice as many steps due to her
short legs, which let her down later.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async,
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> still blazing away with <font color="#FF0000">Little
Neck</font> moaning again just behind <font color="#FF0000">Furgie's</font>
behind, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> also whining at the back keeping
watchful eye on the hares for short cuts which we would have taken if that
asshole had not been so slow. Hares ran trail by the side of the river with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
moaning, we’re fucked if we have to cross the river it’s too high.
Suggestions of a canoe were muted by the hares, with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
moaning all the way. Do we have an award for moaning fart of the millennium?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Hares eventually caught slow runners with a tree
bridge crossing part of the river with one of <font color="#FF0000">Basket's </font>torches
(Flashlights for you uneducated bastards) bouncing on the ice, it was seriously
cold. But there was more!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> convinced us
all he knew this crossing which was the only dry way he said, then went very
quiet when he came up to the rivers edge. <font color="#FF0000">Async, Hopeless </font>and
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were across the 100-foot crossing and very
wet, moaning and shouting you fuckin </font> <img border="0" src="fergie.jpg" align="left" width="288" height="216"><font face="Arial" size="3"> Bastards. What a dilemma for the rest, cars
and warm clothes in site or turn back a full two miles.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
being a lazy bastard </font> <font face="Arial" size="3"> was not going to turn back, the hares led the way and after
chipping off ice from the gonads, encouraged the rest over. Little Neck and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
moaning every step of the way with expletives coming out of every
orifice.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Furgie</font> thoroughly enjoying
herself chose a different way in, which the hares knew from cold experience was
deeper.&nbsp;&nbsp; But <font color="#FF0000">Furgie</font></font> <font face="Arial" size="3">who
thought she was Jane in Tarzan, used the vines to swing across the final 4 feet.
But the weight of her tits brought the tree down and <font color="#FF0000">Furgie</font>
ended up tasting river. She emerged from the river with larger nipples than any
of the male pricks, which were seriously shrunk.&nbsp; Last over was <font color="#FF0000">Trail
Hoover</font>, being guided in by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> saying the
last part was only 4 feet deep, but the quiet thing shouted &quot;fuck you, I am
only 5 foot tall, you asshole&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Everyone
across safely, everyone was comparing shrinking dicks against <font color="#FF0000">Furgie's</font>
nipples.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Furgie </font>won no question, who can
compete against organ stops, no wonder Hopeless has always got black eyes!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Ice chipped off, back to<font color="#FF0000">
Basket's </font>for the circle. All the whimps had to have the circle inside, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
stark bollock naked, was given a nightie to wear to hide his embarrassment until
<font color="#FF0000">Furgie’s</font> nipples had gone down. Ratings for the
run were the highest since records begun, and down downs were had by joint
hares. Infractors were punished in the usual fashion and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
was given a transplant of new dick and balls soon to be seen on the web
site.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> vowed never ever to
run a Rhody hash ever again. She prefers the more girlie runs in Boston.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Santa visited RIH3 with presents for everyone all
presents had sexual overtones and the whole pack ended the evening in a mass
orgy with everyone getting fucked one way or another.</font></p>
