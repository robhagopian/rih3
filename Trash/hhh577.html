off Breakneck Hill exit off route 146. &nbsp;Attendees included </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little

yours truly. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The run set off into uncharted territory after
a circle jerk around an old drive in where Jaws 1 was the featured event.

they were going to keep dry, how wrong they were. The trail very quickly
led to another wet crossing after which came another circle jerk which
your scribe blew right through-by luck. </FONT></P>

right by the run path. The circle jerkers eventually came around to eventually
catch me up at the beer check which was conveniently placed across the
Blackstone River, which was more polluted than Chernobyl. Beers were consumed
with our choirmaster leading the mid point singing. The on back was back
over the river onto a path which led to yet another water crossing at this

and the need for more bags. Up through an old building yard where </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Gobble

pride was the only thing that was dented with a slight stiff neck. The
Tyson method of retaliation was considered but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Gobble</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">

started biting quickly and candles were erected with Hopeless trying to
set his ars on fire with one of them. Some more home-brew by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">

river crossings, a good time had by all. </FONT></P>
