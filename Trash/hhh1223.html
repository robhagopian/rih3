was a lovely day, and the start was not, for once, from <FONT

trail led south. Only the fleet of foot and the exceptionally stupid followed 
trail. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi 
</FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> led on what proved to be an annoying 
and unecessary loop, coming back to just below the dam, where they saw <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> crossing the 
river, knee deep and slipping. The rest soon followed. Trail bushwhacked up to a 
dirt road, parallel to the river west.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Back on the dirt track, limited marks were seen as they continued 
west. Finally, a check led north to some railroad tracks. A family of hikers was 
coming from the west. So the pack turned away and came to the adjacent railroad 
bridges of the NE trunkline and the Providence-Worcester RR. No marks. They 
turned back and asked the family if they had seen any white powder. Yes, they 
had. So on west they went, and found the next mark, finally turning towards the 
river. Heading to the water, the beer check was discovered by the Millville 
Lock.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The hare was there, along with <FONT color=#ff0000>Jovi 
Juice</FONT> and a small flotilla of canoes and kayaks. The beer was opened. 
Late cummers began to straggle in. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was late? 
Well, maybe a little, but not like <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Or <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT>. Or&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT>. Or, 
in fact, the family of hikers who had actually bee looking for the Millville 
Lock. (Songs were temporarily halted for the sake of the children.) 
Unfortunately for the family, Wrung Guyhad chosen a singularly garish and 
visually painful pair of shorts for this run. All were appalled. Perhaps he 
should be re-named: <FONT color=#ff0000>Wrung Shorts</FONT>?Last in: <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>. Almost no beer was left. But <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> had their usual 
fight in the mud, occuring almost inevitably when the 
particular&nbsp;combination of <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT>, canoes, and mud is 
present.<BR><o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>On-back, a few chose the water route. The rest settled for 
following trail backwards. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> were in one canoe, <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo 
</FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Nick</FONT> kayaked, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> went with <FONT color=#ff0000>Jovi Juice</FONT> in 
another canoe. This provided an opportunity for the rest of the pack to hurl 
projectiles and/or bodily fluids from one or both of the railroad bridges. 
Luckily, their aim was off, and/or the hare had not provided enough beer to 
fully recharge their bladders.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finally back at the cars, the circle was announced to be at<FONT 
color=#ff0000> Basket’s</FONT>, not the lazy hare’s. What a wank! They drove 
back into Glendale, and after an interminable wait, circled up. The run was 
considered an outstanding run for this hare. This brought it up to a level of 
ALMOST MEDIOCRE! Total: +0.69! A block of ice was provided and contaminated by 
the hare. Visitors and backsliders were punished, all eager to avoid the brown 
stain on the ice. Hashit was given to <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>. For 
cryin’ out loud, do you think I can remember why? A fine meal of Dynamites, 
chili and <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> brew brought the evening to a 
satisfying&nbsp;although ultimately&nbsp;bowel-cleansing 
end.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
