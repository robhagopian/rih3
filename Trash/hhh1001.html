<p><i>Low-flying UFOs, Bigfoot creatures, cattle mutilations, Indian curses and ghostly apparitions. These are just a 
sampling of the wide range of paranormal phenomena that are constantly occurring in the area of Massachusetts known as 
the Bridgewater Triangle. First described by researcher Loren Coleman in the 1970s, the Triangle is an area of about 200 
square miles that includes the towns of Abington, Rehoboth and Freetown at the angles of the triangle, and Bridgewater, 
West Bridgewater, North Middleboro, Segreganset, Dighton, North Dighton, Berkley, Myricks, Raynham, East Taunton, and 
Taunton inside the triangle. Unexplained phenomena are also common in the towns just outside this region...</i></p>

<p><i>One of the sites associated with ancient Native American activity in the Bridgewater Triangle has earned a 
reputation for being haunted in modern times. Along Route 44 in Rehoboth lies the boulder known as Anawan Rock. Located in 
a swamp, it was here that the Wampanoag chief Anawan surrendered to the colonists, thus ending King Philip's War. According 
to local belief, the angry spirits of the warriors captured that day continue to haunt the spot. Witnesses report 
frequently seeing or smelling smoke in the area, despite the fact that no fire can be located. One pair of visitors to 
Anawan Rock saw a bonfire blazing atop the rock, which disappeared before their eyes. Another individual was scared away 
from the site by a loud angry male voice shouting, "Iootash, iootash!" Later, it was found that this word is an Algonquin 
term meaning "stand and fight". Recently, ghost hunter Courtney Chadwick visited and photographed the site. When the 
pictures were developed, one showed what appears to be a cloud of smoke obscuring part of the image. Nothing unusual had 
been seen when the photo was taken!...</i></p>

<p><i>Recently, on June 6th, 2005 there were multiple simultaneous and independent reports of strange activities at Anawan 
Rock. An unusually foul odor was noted by several neighbors. Strange cries, whistles and bugle calls were heard emanating 
from within the Squannakonk swamp. Piteous wails as if from those in mortal pain seemed to be moving deeper and deeper 
into the impassable mire itself. We will probably never have a reasonable explanation for this...</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> trail in virgin territory is certain to be trouble. Nevertheless, defying all 
common sense, the usual crowd arrived promptly, initially eager for another hash. But the atmosphere soon changed. The 
air was thick and miasmic, and those there were soon unaccountably gloomy. A sense of doom, of a hovering evil presence 
was felt by the group, as they put on extra bug repellant and ivy block. Many actually considered claiming that they 
needed to leave early to pick someone up at the airport. It has worked in the past. But what was happening to the usually 
intrepid hashers? <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> mentioned that she had heard that this site was haunted by the 
spirits of the Native Americans who died here 330 years earlier. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> confirmed this 
(being one-fourth Native American of Winkawankcan descent, a small splinter tribe of the Narragansetts). Could it be that 
this hash was cursed? They would soon find out. They were off at 6:30..</p>

<p>Trail led southeast straight to the rock itself. This was a well-marked, graded, and enjoyable trail. Almost like a 
gas pipeline. For fifty yards. They climbed over the rock. Then came the first sign of their impending fate. A paper 
square marked “HHH” was stapled to a tree at the edge of the swamp. Led by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, they followed the trail into the swamp heading south. At first, they all tried to 
keep their feet dry. It was soon clear that this was hopeless, and a line formed. The leaders <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> gradually distanced themselves 
from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> tried to stay DFL in the hope that behind <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> some form of rough trail (like a gas pipeline) would result from their passage.</p>

<p>Trail led south and west at first. The trio in front traded the lead as the hare’s marks meandered chaotically (as 
if he had been pursued by the spirits of dead warriors). There were no trails. There were no deer paths. There were no 
gas pipelines. In fact, there was no evidence save the paper squares that anyone had ever passed this way before. There 
was no chance of turning back, as all the marks faced the hashers. There were no features to the swamp that could be 
used as landmarks. It was just swamp, swamp, and more swamp.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>And more swamp.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1001/topo.jpg"><br><br>Topographic of same. Still nothing of interest. Note the

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, a check was encountered. Overjoyed, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
promptly took the falsies while <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> turned left, due south on true trail. <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, understandably tired of the posterior view of 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>, used the opportunity to pass and catch up with the lead pack. A few lovely 
purple swamp orchids were found, further slowing <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> down as he felt it necessary to 
crush each one into submission. Trail gradually turned southeast. Not a pipeline to be seen.</p>

<p>A cyclic phenomenon was noted. It was about 30-50 yards of swamp, usually up to mid-calf, although sometimes it 
crossed the thigh. Then, climbing up the bases of small cedar trees (and stepping into the hidden holes between the 
roots), relatively dry areas lasting about 20 yards would be reached. These were invariably overgrown with unavoidable 
bull-briars. Considerable blood loss resulted and if the hare had been present at this point, it is unlikely he would 
have made it back out alive. Especially after the hashers rinsed their fresh cuts in stinking mud!.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1001/swamp.jpg"><br><br>This looks a lot nicer than it actually was!</p></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mosquitoes (in an area endemic for both West Nile Virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis) were a constant presence, 
although the ticks were disappointingly rare. Few hashers found more than two or three. Some lucky ones did encounter 
webs with stinging spiders, though. And the mold and fungal spores, pollen, and dust started all of them coughing and 
wheezing. There’ll be no more normal chest X-Rays in the RIH3, for a while. But, on the bright side, there was virtually 
no poison ivy. No Native American ghosts were sighted. And, there were ALMOST no leeches, mud wasps, porcupines, tse-tse 
flies, pit vipers or dingoes.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1001/dingo.jpg"><br><br>“A dingo ate my baby!”</p></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hashers’ progress was accompanied by some noise. There were the usual bugles, horns, whistles and ”on-on”s. 
Falling trees, ripping garments and flesh, splashes, noisome bubblings, and snapping branches also marked the passage of 
the dispirited hashers. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> pre-rated the run a record breaking 47 F***s. His sentiments 
were loudly seconded by the equally foul invectives of the distraught <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> swore revenge would be his at next week’s hash when he would hare. <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> vowed vocally and intemperately that she would not be happy until the hare’s genitals were 
ripped off and dangling from a string around her neck. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> volunteered to perform the 
necessary surgery. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, tree-trunk club in hand, offered to provide anesthesia. 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was somehow enjoying the outing, and protested.</p>

<p>The trail turned east. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> guaranteed he knew what was ahead: a gas pipeline. He was 
surprised when <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> led the FRB’s out onto New Road. The hare met them. The rest 
emerged from the swamp. 54 minutes of swamp time, according to the official swamp-time-keeper <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font>. A new record! Back on a flour trail, they turned north on New Road. They passed the gas pipeline (all 
ignoring it, except <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>. It is a damn fine gas pipeline!) and came to a check. True 
trail was right (east) on Maple. The powerlines were found. North again, across 44 to a few mud puddles (cleaning the 
running shoes nicely; it’s all relative!) and a “B”, just past an abandoned refrigerator. Twice the distance covered 
in the swamp, in one-tenth the time!.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, usually a beer hound, was first and his searches came up empty. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> likewise, feverish from their time in the swamp, 
could not find the beer. The rest of the pack arrived, led by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. The hare brought out 
the beer. The hare brought out the mosquitoes. As always, the hare was impregnable. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
was oblivious. But the rest complained mightily. Songs were impossible, with all the whining. So after one or two 
beers, they packed up and continued north..<br>&nbsp;</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1001/Beer.jpg"><br><br>A Bondo imitator, finding Beer.</p></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They came to Chestnut St, turned left and ran to New Street. South to 44, and right (east) on 44 back to the parking 
lot. Total was about a mile. On roads. Pathetic! What about the gas pipeline, hare? They crossed it, again the hare 
failing to take advantage of the opportunity. They all straggled in. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> insisted that 
they hold the ceremony upon the rock itself. Few wanted to actually walk the 50 yds. But eventually they did, hoping 
the altitude might discourage some of the swarming mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Ratings for the run: virgin territory, angered Native American ghosts, swamp, thorns, mosquitoes, and unequalled 
shiggy vs. 2 miles of pavement, lack of losses, lack of checks, lack of virgins, lack of gas pipelines and lackluster 
beer: total of 6.9! Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for thoughtfully removing a gnat from 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> eye on trail. What was he thinking? [Note: he responded to this award by sending 
the Hashit careening down from the rock, where several Native American wraiths took it away for their own spectral 
uses. Ghosts apparently need a comfortable place to sh*t, too! But, I digress.]. They swang low and climbed down the 
hill. But the Hashit is gone, perhaps to the spirit world! Beware!.</p>

<p>On On On was at Tort’s, back in Seekonk. 35 oz beers and free popcorn are fine. But Monday being Karaoke night is 
not! Food was ordered, beer was delivered. And of course, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had to sing. Accompanied 
by an off-key <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and a bleeding <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, their rendition 
of “Hello penis my old friend” left much to be desired. And one of <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> patients was 
watching. So much for that referral pattern! It was a sad ending to a fine evening. But it was neither more, nor less 
than expected..</p>
