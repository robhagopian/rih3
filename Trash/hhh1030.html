<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Early arrival <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was joined at the start in melting snow by misguided wankers 
<font color="#FF0000">Pig F**ker</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Nice Snatch</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Willie 
Wanky</font>. They had driven from Albany New York. They had arrived under the misapprehension that there was to be a 
Christmas hash in RI. How could they know? <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was hare. (Note to Hash: We really should 
publish disclaimers on the web site.) He was “live-setting” with his son-in-law! There would be no merry Hashmas this 
year! The hares took off. A policeman drove by. He took one look, shook his head and wished them well. He must know 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Some beer was opened. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> drove up. Can’t get much 
worse than this. But at least he brought whiskey. This softened the blow a bit when <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
pulled up. Worse, yet! <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> arrived. A bit late, they set out east from the parking area on an abandoned road.</p>

<p>Rapidly they moved off road, onto some poorly cleared trails. The group stayed together uphill and then turning south. 
The marks were few, and poorly placed, with miniscule quantities of flour. So far, so good. Nevertheless, together they 
came to the first major check. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> turned east. The rest spilled out onto Sumner Brown 
Road. All directions were tried unsuccessfully. But finally they realized that they would have to follow <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Reluctantly, most reluctantly. They turned east and then north. The trail began to zigzag. 
This allowed the followers to bushwhack in a straight line and catch up to the leaders. Still together, they burst out 
into a muddy clearing and another check.</p>

<p>Trail was found by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Pig F**ker</font>. It led east across 
a stream, and then uphill. The path was occasionally interesting: it led through water puddles, thin ice, or even ice 
submerged under freezing water. About half chose the direct (wet) route, while the others struggled through brush and 
briars alongside the path. Trail turned north on a ridge line above the stream. The visitors and <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> led <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> left 
(west) at a check at the base of a hill. While they circled the hill, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> heard the dogs straight ahead. They bushwhacked north up the hill and arrived at the beer check 
minutes behind the leaders. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Nice Snatch</font> were 
unaccounted for.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> Beer was broached and the RI Rhubarb refused to rise yet again. Just as it seemed 
that the run might be a success, <font color="#FF0000">Nice Snatch</font> arrived. Even worse, it was not too long before 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> appeared. In disgust, the hare headed down and out onto the powerlines to set trail 
on out. After the beer was finished, the rest, led by <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font>, followed. Trail led southwest on the powerline path. The stream crossed the trail. <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> crossed the stream. Up to her waist. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> followed, but the 
rest found a narrow log bridge a few yards into the woods.</p>

<p>They continued up the powerlines into a residential area. They crossed Grant’s Mill Rd. There were no marks. Clearly 
they were on the right track. Especially when the path led back down into a swamp. But just when the trail was starting to 
be enjoyable, they came out and found the entry trail which led back to the cars.  It was decided to circle up back at the 
hare’s. So they convoyed over to Woonsocket, and set up shop, not in the garage, but in the first floor rooms! Where they 
found <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>! Woonsocket is full of these kinds of hazards.</p>

<p>Ratings for the run: nice swamp and shiggy, decent beer, and minimal pavement had to contend with no one lost, <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> at the BC and <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> at the circle. Only the holiday spirit 
allowed a <b>+0.69</b>.  Hashit was initially given to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, but he seemed to want it so 
much it was transferred to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  Closing the circle, food was brought out. And then it was 
time for <font color="#FF0000">Santa Basket</font> and the Yankme Swap. Popular items were Spam, sexual aids, some 
Guinness, Spam, a “NY Solid Waste Assn.” Jacket, Spam, Spam and Spam. (Bloody Vikings!) Another wasted holiday.<p>
