<font color="#0000ff">Location: </font>far off the beaten path on Heartbreak Pond in what could have been the Arctic 
Circle<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Weather:</font> effin cold, blistering wind, ice-covered ground, and bloody dark<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hounds:</font> Jake, Ben, Seamus<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Idiots:</font> Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS</p>

<p>I was first to arrive at Heartbreak Pond this fine 
winters evening. It was a quarter past 6 and not one other freezing bugger was 
around. This was history in the making.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> first to arrive!!!</p>

<p>Then, after 10 minutes of talking to my dog, because 
nobody else was in earshot, I got to thinking, maybe I’m at the wrong start? 
Maybe there’s a huge pack of hashers standing around somewhere else, wondering 
where <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>is and if he’ll show? Wondering if 
tonight, there would be no one to pick on, or give the Hashit to, or blame 
something stupid on? Or maybe, it was too cold for everyone but Seamus and me.</p>

<p>Then an &quot;On On&quot; carried across the pond, just around 
the bend, at the other parking area. Surely the crowd would be there instead, 
and I wasn’t first after all.</p>

<p>As I pulled in beside 2 cars, <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> was chatting small talk to the Hare, and as I rolled down my window 
to say hey. They said they saw me pull in, but they decided they had some 
private conversations going on, and they were going to wait to see if I would 
look for them.</p>

<p>I complimented them both on their winter clothing, 
and as I got out of the warm car in my lab coat and shorts, I was thinking how 
warm it must be at home, and how few of us showed up tonight. Finally, the last 
idiot arrived, and we waited for some time as <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
finished dressing, before taking off, clockwise, around the lake.</p>

<p>The hare had us bushwhack for about a quarter mile, 
as is customary for this hare, as his goal is to maim or cripple as many as 
possible right off the bat. That way we won’t ask him to hare anymore. We’re too 
smart for that. We see right through his plan, and we’ll keep his on the 
hareline until one of us dies.</p>

<p>We made our way out to a trail, that continued 
northerly until we found ourselves, at a walkway, over the northern most point. 
Beer was discovered and the four enjoyed some extremely cold beer. The dogs had 
even less intelligence, as they played in the brook and swamp under the bridge, 
pulling out sticks to play tug of war with, and run between legs, to trip and 
cripple us.</p>

<p>The enjoyment was short lived, as
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>decided he had had enough, and proceeded 
southerly around the pond. The Hare advised the remaining Hounds, that back 
counterclockwise was shorter, and he would be taking that route, back to the 
cars. Being super intelligent, we made our separate ways back to the cars, and 
circled up.</p>

<p>It was short and sweet. Hare got Down-downed,
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> got Hashit, we sang a couple songs, and 
Swing-lowed. Then headed over to Mark’s for some food and beer, and relief from 
the cold. The conversation in Mark’s was mostly about the absent Hounds.
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, as well as <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
found something more important to do, each sticking to stories of family 
responsibilities. Now there’s an Oxymoron. Hashers and Responsibilities just 
don’t belong in the same paragraph! As for the other missing in action, the 
bimbos get off because it was tit-biting cold, and we know how that hurts. 
Everyone else is either crippled or hash wanna-be’s.</p>
