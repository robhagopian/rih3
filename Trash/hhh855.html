<font color="#0000ff">Hare: </font>The Slasher Dr. WHO<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Location:</font> Coventry/West Greenwich<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Scribe:</font> The Raging Queen of Beers<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Weather:</font> Clearing, after torrential downpours washed away what little flour the cheap and 
pathetic hare placed stingily along the trail, if you can call it that, and temperature was too comfortable also, being in 
the 60’s<br>

Dr WHO (hare), Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, Async, WIPOS, Oozing, Raging Queen, Fuwangi Boner, EverReady, Summer’s Eve 
Seven Year Bitch, Treehouse, Tinker, KNO, Jake, Ben and Baxter.<br>

<font color="#0000FF">Commemorating: </font>Baxter’s Last Run (May he hash in peace).</p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Well, at least the hare got one thing right. He set the start from Marks’ (exit 6 not 6A) where I could find it easy, 
and not too far from Connecticut either. Everyone gathered and I must say it was a sorry sight. The rain stopped at 6:15 
and they all got out of their cars, as if they were afraid they might of got wet or something. I’m a chemist, and I know 
people are basically waterproof or water-resistant or something. And what a bunch of old cripples! I may have to start my 
own hash down in old Grotty.</p>

<p>The hare began to whine about the rain washing away his flour. I took a swig from my Bud Light and tried not to listen. 
But it was hard to drink secretly because <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> might have seen it and tried to get some. And 
all these Coventry cops kept pulling into the Dunkin’ Donuts. But anyway, the hare provided secret instructions for the 
crippled wankers <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker,</font> and for <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>so as to protect Baxter (who was the only one worth anything at this hash anyways and you’d never see him 
turn up his nose at a Bud Light for sure). The rest of us took off into the woods on a freakin’ path! I mean where’s the 
swamp shiggy?</p>

<p>I was following <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font> and <font color="#FF0000">TreeHouse</font>. These guys can 
run. It was like they were being chased by Ben with an erection. Oh, that’s right, they were! Behind me <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing, Hoover (SESYB), Muffalotta </font>(woo-hoo!) and the hare jogged along, with <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo, EverReady</font> and <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> doing some kind of threesome thing in the rear. There were 
lots of checks, but no one except the <font color="#FF0000">Boner</font> could see them. And he didn’t even have a 
flashlight. I guess he is good at seeing rings in the dark. We headed roughly north and came to a road. Some of us crossed 
and tried to go for a swim in a fishing area. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>must have had a spat with <font 
color="#FF0000">Hoover (SESYB)</font> cause he took off alone south along the riverbank. The hare finally wheezed his way 
up to us and started marking arrows on the road with some chalk. He could at least have brought a few freakin’ Buds if he 
could remember to bring chalk.</p>

<p>We crossed the river at a bridge and went about 100 yards on Harkney Hill Road. Then we turned onto a dirt road that 
went behind a field. Lots of good puddles. Then we were back on another piece of freakin’ pavement. I had on my new 
camouflage gear (<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> told me where I could get a deal) and had been counting on some briars 
to test them. Boy, was I getting freakin’ mad. I gave up a seminar on conjugating Esters for this. We milled around on Fish 
Hill Road for a while looking for any sign of powder. Apart from a Colt 45 can that had only one good swig left in it 
(it’s gassy, but better than nothing), I couldn’t find anything. The hare caught up again and made with his chalk like the 
marks had been there all along. What a wank! South we ran. We turned into a dirt road where a sign said you need to wear 
neon orange for turkey season. For these guys it’s always turkey season, but I didn’t see any freakin’ neon orange.</p>

<p>We headed into a sandpit and things started to look up a bit. The puddles in the trail were deeper, and still somehow, 
the <font color="#FF0000">TreeHouse</font> guy and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner </font>managed to find trail or at 
least pretend they did. The hare behind me took all the false trails by mistake. He may have been trying to get alone with 
<font color="#FF0000">Muffalotta</font>, or the <font color="#FF0000">Hoover (SESYB) </font>but <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> kept showing up. Actually, up in front we could keep tabs on the slow guys behind us just by listening for 
the sounds of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> in the woods (F*ck this sh*t!, F*ckin’ a**hole!, etc.). We went through 
some prime shiggy finally, unavoidable puddles with rusting metal garbage and Bud Light cans (empty, dammit!) hid just 
below the surface. The trail led between two ponds and then turned west, and uphill.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the walking wounded had reached the beer check well before us, even with <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi 
</font>leading us on. This was high atop another sand mound near Camp Bosco, You see, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
isn’t the only one who can read a freakin’ topo map! They quickly found the beer, which the hare couldn’t hide anyways, 
not with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> to sniff it out. They finished off 
the Bud Light before I made it in, those bastards, and all I was left with was some namby-pamby yuppie brown stuff in a 
juice jar. Everyone straggled in gradually, except <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> who was on the wrong side of the 
river. He had run into <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, and the two off them swapped tales about what hotshot hashers 
they were, and too bad the rest of the pack was lost. The group sang some pathetic songs and waited a while for <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> until the <font color="#FF0000">Hoover (SESYB)</font>said “Screw him, I want supper!” so we 
hit the trail again.</p>

<p>Trail came out on the access road to the fishing area, but there were no marks, just a gay couple in a car drinking Bud 
Longnecks. I was tempted to join them, but the hare led the way across the river up to his tits in shiggy so I had to 
follow. We came through some briars at last and went uphill where we found <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> sharing a cigarette. We had an impromptu second beer stop for them (OK by me, I was hoping 
they’d finish off that freakin’ swill before we circled up) and had to listen to their excuses for a while. Trail led back 
east uphill and most of us abandoned the flour–free fiasco when we came to the motel on Rt3. We came back to the cars by 
way of the street.</p>

<p>It turned out that the hash was a success in some respects at least.&nbsp; Ben was missing, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>were temporarily missing (actually, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> had to relocate <font color="#FF0000">Tinker’s</font> fake hips that he knocked out trying to get over the 
bridge rather than going through the water), and the <font color="#FF0000">Hoover (SESYB) </font>or <font color="#FF0000">
EverReady</font> or somebody bought donuts. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>drove off to find Baxter or Ben. Eventually, 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, Baxter and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> emerged from the woods, saying “Quick, 
let’s get out of here before <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> gets back!” Finally, the circle was joined. I had to slip 
a couple of Bud Lights into my shorts so’s I could refill during the circle. Ratings for the run: who cares, we all know 
it freakin’ sucked. I think he ended up with a 0.69, but it was so long ago, I can’t remember. And I was on my second Bud, 
so I was pretty wasted. Hashit should’ve gone to<font color="#FF0000"> Oozing </font>for frolicking in the woods with <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> or maybe to <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>for whining about his back. Somehow I think it 
ended up with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Good! I hope it will teach him to start beechwood aging his freakin’ 
home-brews.</p>

<p>A few lousy songs later and we swung low, and moved into the restaurant. We were still missing the hound Ben. Luckily, 
as soon as we entered Mark’s, the waitress said that the Animal Shelter had picked up a stray Labrador that was sexually 
assaulting some poultry over near Lake Mishnock, and could <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> please pick him up in the 
morning. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> began to curse (how unlike him) and swore he would never pick up the f*ckin’ 
moronic, f*ckin’ annoying son of a f*ckin’ b*tch. We were quickly moved to a new table situated as far as possible from the 
real customers. The waitress allowed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to bring Baxter in, and Baxter was served a Philly 
Cheesesteak.  The rest of us ate and drank, and we all said our farewells to Baxter. He was a real hasher (unlike his owner 
or the hare for that matter) and we'll freakin’ miss him.</p>
