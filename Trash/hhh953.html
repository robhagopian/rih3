<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> Tinker</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Co-Hare:</font> Bill the Beak</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location: </font>Simmons Mill Pond, Little Compton</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> High 70’s, Humid</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Oozing SD, SESYB, Dr WHO, Async, Fuwangi Boner, Basket Boom 
Boom, Ben, Seamus. Visitor: Joystick (some Osuckahara H3 in Japan). Virgin: Just Ryan (still unofficial as he left before 
the circle).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>One of the larger groups lately seen on a Monday evening in the RIH3 met at the parking area for the Simmons Mill 
Pond Management area on Colebrook Road in Little Compton. Geographically speaking, this is about as far as you can get 
from Burrillville in the state of Rhode Island, possibly accounting for the good attendance. Both a visitor and a virgin 
were able to follow the directions left on the website. (Naturally, they followed <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> 
directions rather than the hare’s, as both were available, but only one was intelligible.) At 6:30, there was no sign of
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, so the pack hurriedly started down the access road into the management area.</p>

<p>The road led southeast to a first check-mark.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>turned right into some fields, 
collecting a swarm of deer flies that would persist with the group for most of the run.  <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing </font>went straight and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> wandered over to the side of the Mill pond while 
the rest caught up. Finally true trail was found on the east side of the pond, past the abandoned fishing shack turning 
north then east. True to form, the hare was conserving flour and there were several checks without checkmarks.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> caught on first and they turned southeast over dried spillway between two ponds. They 
then encountered a wet spillway, providing the only shiggy of the night. Trail wove around the four ponds, and turned 
back west, almost to the Mill Pond before angling further south.</p>

<p>The group although spread out, was still on trail until they came out to a tree farm and a patchwork of fields. 
Trail initially appeared to lead back into the woods, but it was noted that all the marks on this bushwhack were on 
the backs of the trees. After completing a circuit and ending up back on the same trail that had brought them to the 
fields, the hare admitted that he had made a mistake. While setting trail, he had become lost and had not intended the 
pack to follow this loop. He gave some helpful advice such as “I’m almost sure the trail is around here somewhere!” and 
“I wish I could remember where I went at this point.” After a disorienting tour of the various fields, which confused 
even the deer flies, <font color="#FF0000">Async, Bondo, Joystick</font> and the virgin promptly repeated the loop. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed briefly, but decided to stick with the hare who was sending <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>off scouting in all directions.</p>

<p>Even though the hare was completely lost, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>somehow stumbled onto the real trail. 
With <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, he led, choosing to mark his passage with atonal, off-key singing. The trail 
was a good bushwhack, through skunk cabbage and barely moist swamp southwards. It would have been prime after a few good 
rains. As it was, even the deer flies were parched. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB, WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font> followed close behind. The hare hung back trying to call <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and the others 
back on trail. But they had met up with late-comer <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and unaccountably decided to 
follow his advice.<font color="#FF0000"> Async</font> should know better.</p>

<p>The lead pack was firmly on trail now. The beer check was finally reached, at an unremarkable spot on the side of 
Amesbury Lane. No physical features, no hill or rock, no water, only a small patch of poison ivy was present to 
distinguish the choice for a beer stop. But it was hot, the beer provided by the cohare was cold and welcome. They, 
or rather the half of the hash that had made it, enjoyed their beers on the road (while intermittently ducking back 
into the woods to avoid discovery by the infrequent cars passing by).</p>

<p>After a prolonged wait at the BC, they decided to proceed without the rest, and turned east on the lane, which 
soon turned south to a check on Pottersville Rd. <font color="#FF0000">WHO </font>checked east.  <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> checked west. The hare led <font color="#FF0000">SESYB </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
straight, through a gated driveway. They came together along this road, running past some exclusive houses and then 
turning west just above the tantalizingly named Quicksand Pond. An arrow and a check led to some needless confusion in 
the fallow fields, but they soon regrouped and continued west on Quicksand Road to Long Highway, where they were met by 
the hare in his car.</p>

<p>The hare offered a ride, but fearful of the Hashit, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> continued to run, while <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> took advantage of the hare. [Possibly in more 
ways than one. She has been spending a lot of time with him on the runs lately. But I digress.] At any rate, it was a 
short run south on the Long Highway to the corner of William Sisson Road, and the plaque commemorating the birthplace of 
the Rhode Island Red. Several vehicles were there, as well as the entire company of lost hashers, and a cooler of beer.</p>

<p>A beer check was staged, with photo opportunities commemorating the visit to the sacred shrine of the Red Cock. The 
cacophony of excuses, not just from Basket, but now also from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font>, was too much to bear. So after a few songs, they packed up and drove back to the starting point to collect 
their cars. The On On On was to be at Bill the Beak’s house in Tiverton, and apart from the wise virgin (who made 
excuses and promised to return soon. Right!), they all managed to drive north without getting too lost.</p>

<p>At the <font color="#FF0000">Beak’s</font> there was more beer, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>Chili/Dynamites 
cooking. The circle was joined in the backyard. Ratings for the run were good. Complaints included: good weather, no 
shiggy, missed opportunities for a swim in four fresh-water ponds and the brackish Quicksand Pond, and autohashing. On 
the positive side: deer flies, loss of 50% of the pack at the BC, Historical monuments, and at least temporary loss of 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo.</font> Total: 6.9! Hashit went to <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> for planning to participate in the Big Man Run in Somerville the next week, as if that 
compares to the egregious sins committed by the others that night! The circle closed with the usual chaos, and they ate 
and drank well into the night. The hash departed, secure in the knowledge that there was one visitor and one virgin that 
they would never see again. Well done!</p>
