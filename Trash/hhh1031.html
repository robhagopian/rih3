<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The pressure was on.  The precedent for the First Hash of the Year was already set to astronomical levels, that not 
even the venerable legend <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> could even hope to achieve.  Let’s go back in time 
and see why…<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jan. 3, 2005 – Tri-State Hash</p>

<p>“It was unseasonably warm, if not toasty. A light rain was falling. It was pitch black. What better way to greet the 
New Year than to show up in the middle-of-nowhere Massachusetts for a run set by an unemployed hare recovering from 
multiple surgeries.”<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jan. 5, 2004 – Pulaski Park Shiggy Romp</p>

<p>“The Inner Border trail was reached and followed to the covered bridge, crossed east and then taking a completely 
unnecessary shiggy romp up the North South Trail, into the woods through more excellent wetness and back to the covered 
bridge. The hare's a wank!”<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jan. 6, 2003 – Dr. WHO’s Revenge</p>

<p>“All in all, <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> succeeded in thoroughly punishing the hash for that damn case of 
Genny Light.   Raging would have been proud.”<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jan. 7, 2002 - The Johnston Powerline Electromagnetic Nocturnal Emission Hash!</p>

<p>“If the hare were not <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, this could have been the best hash ever!”<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The list could go on and on, but the point has been made.  Even before the hash, the hare was in trouble.  Obviously 
crumbling under the pressure, the hare was mysteriously absent as the others gathered.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot
</font> met <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> in the parking lot at Tarkiln 
Pond off Mowry Road.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> arrived (it must have been a bank holiday).  <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> showed up, and the hash started to look like another pathetic bunch of regular wankers.  Then 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Lee</font> walked, yes, walked in to join the others.  He mentioned something about a car full 
of other hashers from somewhere in up-state New York, but he couldn’t quite recall any of their names.  Ah, a true 
hasher-to-be.</p>

<p>A car full of traveling hashers arrived carrying <font color="#FF0000">Tub Slut</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Nice 
Snatch</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Willy Wanker</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Pig Fucker</font>.  As the hash 
started to look even more pathetic, Happy Valley H3 showed up to save the day – <font color="#FF0000">Cums on Vacation
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Canus Lickus</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Anti-cock</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">
Ciderman</font> arrived, but the pack was already away, heading to the corner of Mowry Rd and Oak Valley.</p>

<p><i>[Scribe’s Note:  Zzzzzzzzzzzzrrrrrp!  It’s now April 22, 4+ months after this hash, and I still haven’t finished 
this write-up (no doubt indicative of the impression this hash left on me).  Nevertheless, duty calls, and I will continue 
this write-up 100 days and 600 beers later.  The accuracy of this account will no doubt be flawless.]</i></p>

<p>After the check, trail lead down Oak Valley Road with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> blazing the way.  If it 
weren’t for a quick diversion into the woods, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> would have made a b-line straight to 
Slatersville Reservoir.  Trail bent westward, and our happy visitors followed trail and rural roads through private 
property and farmland.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Lee</font> would have been impressed, if he were not still intoxicated 
from the previous hash (somewhere in Upstate New York.. no doubt he still didn’t know he was in RI).  <font 
color="#FF0000">Nice Snatch</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Pig Fucker</font> were almost too fast to miss the first 
beer check – make that a champagne check.  Unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> called them back.  
Fortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Tub Slut</font> was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The thirsty pack made short work of the bottles of champagne, and the pack was off and heading north toward the 
reservoir.  Reaching all-too-familiar territory (even to RIH3’s newest – <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish It Head</font>), the reached the powerline trail just off Douglas Pike.  Clearly dissatisfied by 
the pathetically small portions of champagne, most followed <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Cums on Vacation</font>.  Somewhere along trail the hare mentioned something about a beer check next to a cemetery.  
After crossing Gig Rd, trail was soon lost and the situation was nearing a riot situation, as the thirsty pack frantically 
searched for beer.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, with his keen beer senses, quickly sniffed out the beer in the 
cemetery.  All rejoiced!</p>

<p>Beer, song, sweaty cold hashers, and a cemetery – aaaah, what could be better to start the new year!  After the beer 
check, the pack made the short trip southward and back to Tarkiln Pond to their cars.  Everyone returned to <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> house for the circle and on-on-on.  Comments on the run were predictable from the 
regulars.  Comments on the run were predictable from the visitors.  Comment on the run was predictable from the visiting 
two-timer <font color="#FF0000">Just Lee</font>.  Therefore, the overall rating for the run was a predictable 
<b>–0.69</b>, a brilliant way to start a new year of hashing.  And for hashit, it predictably went to <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, a pathetic way to start a new year of hashing.</p>

<p>Hot food and cold beer were welcomed by all.  Yet the Half Mein and WCC contingents had to take off early, as they were 
attempting to make the WCC H3 hash later that evening – talk about a hard core group of wankers!  The RIH3 hashers hung 
their heads in shame, but only for a short while – nothing more beer couldn’t remedy.</p>

<p>And with that… at least I got this write-up done.. finally!</p>
