<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Back to the Future in Douglas State Forest</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #995</font>, May 2, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Async</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Douglas State Forest, just over MA border from Burrillville.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 50's, chance of showers.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, Dr. WHO, Dry Foot Fairy, Seamus, 
and Ben.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Late Cumers:</font>&nbsp; Tinker, WIPOS, and Fuwangi Boner.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Late Cuming Visitors:</font>&nbsp; Gay Boy and Mas Penis Por Favor (both from La Jolla H3).<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Late, Late, Late Cumers:</font>&nbsp; Trail Hoover and Oozing.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Not Present:</font>&nbsp; Just Areola (week #17).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><i>Scribe’s Note:  After completing this write-up, the run made no sense what-so-ever.  Not that RIH3 hashes 
make any sense anyway, but it could only be understood by a half-eaten bloated rotting maggot-infested water 
buffalo (or perhaps <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>).  Therefore, the run will be described backwards.  It can 
also be read the other way, in case you envy decaying water buffalo (or perhaps <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>).</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10:39 p.m.:  They all left George’s Pizza, stuffed and happy with greasy pizza and beer.  Yet another conclusion 
to a complete waste of an evening.</p>

<p>9:69 p.m.:  The 1,000th Run Committee was stalled in negotiations for the location of the hash after a threat 
of a filibuster by the minority party.  In response, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> will use his political 
capital and bring in Senator Bill Frist (WHH3 hash name:  SMAFLP, a.k.a. Suck My Ass F*cking Liberal P*ssies) and 
change committee rules to secure total control and power.  Surreptitiously, his first order of business will be 
all songs must be sung in German.</p>

<p>9:39 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was stuck in an endless loop:  “What, they have Guinness?  
What, they have Guinness?  What, they have Guinness?”  Et cetera, ad nauseum.</p>

<p>9:29 p.m.:  With much heated antipathy, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> demanded that the next time he 
sings this song, he must wear a ceremonial Indian headdress.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> will hear 
from <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO’s</font> agent.</p>

<p>9:19 p.m.:  At George’s Pizza in Pascoag, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, dressed in costume pretending to be 
the Village People (quite well, by the way), performed the premier hit single “R I H 3” to <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>.  The establishment quickly emptied.</p>

<p>8:69 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> offered the visiting <font color="#FF0000">Gay Boy</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Mas Penis Por Favor</font> his place to say the night, but they took off, missing the 
On-on-on and wishing never to step foot in the state of Rhode Island again, even though they were technically 
in Massachusetts.  [They were later spotted with BH3 on Wed. clearly needing to recover by hashing with a more 
sophisticated bunch of wankers.]</p>

<p>8:59 p.m.:  Total ratings for the run:  +0.69.  It would have been higher if there were nubile topless young 
ladies serving cold Guinness every half mile that the hare said was on trail.  Perhaps they were there, but only 
in the hare’s mind.  The rest were upset that <font color="#FF0000">Just Areola</font> didn’t show.  Hashit:  
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  Why not.</p>

<p>8:49 p.m:  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> offered visiting <font color="#FF0000">Mas Penis Por 
Favor</font> some homemade warm <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew.  She smartly refused, not knowing 
which orifice it came from.  Trying to find the other half of his leg he lost in the shiggy, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> waded through the brook hoping it would float out from the swamp.  Then he gave 
up, mumbling something like "Tis only a flesh wound."</p>

<p>8:39 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was discovered walking in circles on the bridge where they 
would circle.  A wonderful mix of brews were served.  Joining the circle on the bridge, the visitors <font 
color="#FF0000">Gay Boy</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Mas Penis Por Favor</font> finally caught up.  
<font color="#FF0000">Mas Penis Por Favor</font> even brought an umbrella.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
was jealous.  They said they enjoyed the abundant shiggy, but their shoes looked awfully clean and pants mostly 
dry.  Little did they know, they were supposed to swim through the stuff.  Just ask <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.</p>

<p>7:69 p.m:  The pack running southeast on High St. toward the parked cars met two very late-arriving wankers, 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>.  They mumbled something about 
being sick after <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> previous week’s multiple swan dives into Wood River.  Now 
why would <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> be sick too?  Anyway, they were donning enough Kevlar attire, 
that nobody could distinguish them from <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.  They were even wearing <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>-approved hash-pants.</p>

<p>7:59 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> marked his territory after the beer check.  (It’s unnecessary 
to describe the gory details.)</p>

<p>7:49 p.m.:  After a half-mile of northwest bush-wacking, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> was first to 
reach the beer check.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> tried to ream the obelisk marking the CT/MA border 
up his arse.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> arrived and stopped the nightmarish scene.  Cans of Irish stouts 
were opened and contents savored.  The beer check remained relatively civilized until <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> christened <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS's</font> horn.</p>

<p>7:39 p.m.:  Late cumers, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> finally 
caught up to the pack at the “BN” along SW Main St., just 100 yards north from the parked cars.  Too bad they 
circumcised the wonderful shiggy.</p>

<p>7:29 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> spotted <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> near the cars, and signaled them toward the beer check.  Instinctively, they 
went the opposite direction.  Perhaps they were following the other two <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
horns, compliments of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  However, on 
this once-in-a-lifetime occasion, the real <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was correct.</p>

<p>7:19 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> followed the arrow pointing north off the Trunkline Trail 
and into a swamp.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided to woos out and short-cut trail.  Who was the dry 
foot fairy?  No, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was not a dry foot fairy, as <font color="#FF0000">Dr. 
WHO</font> followed true trail into the swamp.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, the hare, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> joined them in wallowing through the wonderful black stinky mire heading north, 
then circling west.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> broke the silence and said, “the great thing about this 
black stuff is you don’t know how deep it is.”  At that moment, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> stepped 
into a 3 foot hole.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, witnessing this unfortunate event, did the obvious and 
stepped into the same hole.  Brilliant!.</p>

<p>6:69 p.m.:  Finding true trail <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led the small pack southeast along the 
Trunkline Trail to enjoy miles and miles of abandoned railroad track bed.  It became apparent that <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> attempted to set a trail in the shape of an areola (see photo).  Using 
state-of-the-art cat-scan technology, MIT researchers were able to capture the mental image of <font 
color="#FF0000">Async's</font> thoughts.  The attached photo was his mental image when a researcher said the 
word "hash."  The nipple was pointed out for an added reference, just in case anyone doesn't know what that is.  
[But I digress]  Nevertheless, the attempt was futile.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Areola</font> was nowhere 
to be found and is likely still at the airport.</p>

<p>6:59 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> led the pack northeast 
along the Coffeehouse Loop.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> into 
Cedar Swamp.  <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> finally arrived at 
the parked cars.  Better never than late.</p>

<p>6:49 p.m.  So far, the trail was relatively boring.  East along Midstate Trail, after the first two checks, 
true trail continued straight.  No shiggy, no nothing.  Pathetic.  Late cuming visitors <font color="#FF0000">Gay 
Boy</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Mas Penis Por Favor</font> from La Jolla H3 arrived to be greeted by a bunch 
of empty cars.  They bravely (stupidly) followed the arrow marking trail and joined the run.</p>

<p>6:39 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>:  “What is this, a walking hash?”  <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> 
arrived late.</p>

<p>6:29 pm.:  They waited for another minute, then they were off, heading southeast, crossing the Trunkline Trail, 
and onto the Midstate Trail.</p>

<p>6:19:69 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> arrived after golfing.  It just got worse.</p>

<p>6:19:00 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> pulled up.  Things couldn’t get any worse than this.</p>

<p>6:09:69 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> arrived.  This hash definitely wasn’t looking good.</p>

<p>6:09:00 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived.  Things were off to a bad start.</p>

<p>5:69 p.m.:  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was parked alone at Gate 19 along SW Main St.  Returning to 
the spot where <font color="#FF0000">Just Areola</font> first hashed, the hare hoped to bring good fortune back 
to RIH3.  Hashing doesn’t get any better than this!</p>

<p>Dear RI Hashers,<br>
Here in San Diego we have 14 different (yes 14) different hashing kennels.<br>
Your recent write up of the Douglas Wilderness area hash on the evening of May 2, 2005 referred to me and <font 
color="#FF0000">Gay Boy as</font> La Jolla hashers. I'd like to make it perfectly clear that we are not, nor ever have 
been La Jolla hashers. It's one of the hashes that one must be invited to and it also happens to take place at the 
same timeand day as another hash that we are more fond of r*nning with. So, the names are <font color="#FF0000">Gay 
Boy</font> from La Jolla and <font color="#FF0000">Mas Penis Por Favor</font> but we are from the <b>San Digoe Hash 
House Harriers</b>.<br>
Regarding the shoes being dry. Are you kidding? We fell into water all over that soggy rotten treed bog and besides it was raining! How could anyone have dry feet after that? Silly!<br>
Here are two photos that I mananged to take before it got dark.<br><br>
PS: We'd been in Newport hitting every bar we could find during the day (love the Dogfish Head at Yesterdays) and were 
beered out by the time the on, on on was on. Sorry we didn't join you.<br>
Hope to see some of you in SD for July's Red Dress Run. <br><br>
