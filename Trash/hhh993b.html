<p><font color="#008000">Run #993</font>, April 18, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dr. WHO</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Tiverton, Eight Rod Farm Management Area.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 50's, clear.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Tinker, Basket, Async, Oozing, Trail Hoover, Dry Foot Fairy, 
and Seamus.  Visitors: Pud Pirate (Boston H3), Fudgy (Boston H3), FMT (Hartford H3).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Not Present:</font>&nbsp; Bondo Jovi, Fuwangi Boner, WIPOS, Areola (Week #15).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>It was a beautiful, clear, balmy spring day, making for completely shitty hash weather.  Hashers were 
instructed to park in a lot off Rt. 77, across from Pond Rd.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> arrived 
first, followed by <font color="#FF0000">Follow My Tits</font> from Hartford.  They were unable to seize upon 
the obvious opportunity to exchange sexual favors.  Pathetic!  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> appeared from 
a field to the east.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, that is.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> arrived, 
then <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> arrived.  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>?  <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>??  Yes, <font color="#FF0000"><b>Tinker</b></font>!!!  Straight from Logan Airport, 
right off the plane from Bangkok, and clutching his passport with a death grip, as he was undoubtedly subjected 
to the full invasive “treatment” by Homeland Security.  He must have still been high from the fine Thai yam-yam 
(smack), as his first priority was to go hashing.  He offered gifts and all were happy.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Pud Pirate</font>, a Bahston hasher, arrived.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> finally showed, dragging a hesitant <font color="#FF0000">Fudgy</font> 
along, also a BH3 hasher who had not hashed in years.  What a fine way to return to hashing!  Stories from 
Hashapalooza were shared, and some wore stolen red BH3 hats.  Yet none of the five (!) potential virgins promised 
by the hare were present.  Everyone became restless.  Giving up on the virgins, they were off.  And after a quick 
check on Rt. 77, they headed east onto an uphill field leading into Eight Rod Farm, an area never before defiled 
by RIH3.  Excellent!  No virgins, but at least rare virgin territory!  Upon <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> 
late arrival, the pack instinctively picked up the pace.</p>

<p>They arrived at a check on a corner of a corn field.  <font color="#FF0000">Pud Pirate</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> dispersed to find trail.  All found 
inconsistent marks.  Trail circle jerked the leaders clockwise through adjacent fields.  Eventually, <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, with his finely honed adaptation skills, started to run directly to the opposite 
corners of each corn field.  The trail then bent southward and reached another corn field corner heavily guarded 
by briars.  This allowed the pack to come together, and unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to 
catch up.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, wearing his “Drugs are our Friends” t-shirt in memory of the 
Timothy McVeigh thing 10 years ago, obviously took the shirt much too literally, as he was high as a kite on some 
super-narcotic.  To make matters worse (as if possible), he spotted <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and became 
uncontrollably giddy with excitement.  Much too excited and doped-up, he took the lead running faster than 
humanly possible.  The rest struggled to keep pace, even <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font>.</p>

<p>They all continued south and reached a small stone wall, again well guarded by briars.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, feeling no pain whatsoever, blew right through the briars leaving chunks of flesh 
and blood.  <font color="#FF0000">Fudgy</font>, already confused and nervous, said something like, “This is Rhode 
Island shiggy?”  Duh!  But it was only to get better.  Feeling sick to her stomach, <font color="#FF0000">FMT</font> 
wondered if she should ditch the run and go back to Hartford, yet she bravely continued.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, and 
<font color="#FF0000">Fudgy</font> were trying their best to keep up with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> as 
trail led through a maze of tall pine trees and onto a dirt road leading into hardwoods.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Pud Pirate</font>, having almost above average intelligence, allowed the other wankers to 
find the obscure trail.  He ran with <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> who shared some fine sex stories fresh 
from Thailand.  Not wanting to miss any action, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">FMT</font> excitedly listened in as well.  The trail led into what could only be described as 
the Appalachia of Rhode Island, as they encountered run-down shacks that appeared to be inhabited by inbreds.  A 
still for making moonshine was spotted.  The silent, abandoned chickens houses made everyone edgy.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> swore she heard a banjo playing a terrifyingly familiar tune.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> thought he heard someone deep in the woods exclaim, “Squeal like a pig, boy!  
Haweeee!  Haweeeee!”  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> wished he brought his compound bow and flesh-ripping, 
razor-tipped arrows, while wearing nothing but a black commando vest over his ripping peck muscles.  The ignorant 
bunch of hashers ran faster until reaching a check far too deep in these spooky woods.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> sounded his horn to bring everyone onto true trail.  Right!  Led by the 
venerable <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, they soon reached a field filled with florescent orange clay pigeons 
(used for skeet shooting).  A clay pigeon flew from out of nowhere and hit <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> in the 
head.  Another one hit <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> in the head.  And then <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font> was assaulted by these flying orange projectiles.  A back check 6.9 was discovered (Brilliant!), as 
well as <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, hiding behind a wooden box and hurling clay pigeons at his fellow 
hashers (typical behavior if he was <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>).  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
giggled with wide-eyed excitement.  Back on trail, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> offered wise advice to the 
much perplexed and frightened visitors and said, “Always go the opposite direction of <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.”  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> continued to demonstrate his fine lack of 
judgment and followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.</p>

<p>Running east then turning north, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> blazed his way wrecklessly through large 
fields of briars, leaving more chunks of flesh for the others to follow.  Briars led to more briars, and more briars 
(did I mention briars?).  Apparently <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> took <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> 
advice to set a briar trail (see <a href="http://members.cox.net/rih3archive/hhh786.html" target=new>#786</a>).  
The briars gave way to fields of mud and muck.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, trying futilely to keep his 
namesake, found trail and led an incomprehensibly singing <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> “hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo; 
hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo…” into a swampy, stinky marsh.  Deep into the mud, muck, and stench, <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> discovered a back check.  Seizing the golden opportunity, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> joined 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> (with <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> playing along) and suckered most of 
the wankers deep into the fine Rhode Island shiggy.  The stench alone was enough to kill a cow.  Only <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Pud Pirate</font> had the presence of mind NOT to follow 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <i>et al.</i> and remained on true trail to quickly take the lead.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was the FRB!  Holy hellfire sh*t!!</p>

<p>A “W” was reached under a tree (but some thought it was really an upside-down "M"), marking a well-deserved 
whisky (moonshine) check.  Single malt Glenfiddich (Scottish moonshine) was enjoyed with refreshing spicy hot 
peanuts.  Half the pack, quickly losing precious blood from their open wounds, used the alcohol to starve off 
impending infection and an inevitable need for a tetanus shot.  Well, that’s what normal people would have done.  
Instead, they drank the scotch (moonshine).  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, still high and uncontrollably giddy 
over <font color="#FF0000">Tinker’s</font> arrival, quickly broke into un-recognizable German song.  The visitors 
drank in nervous silence, savoring the scotch (moonshine), their only source of comfort.  The regulars shook their 
heads in much too well-known disappointment.  And the now traumatized <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> began to 
eat black mud.  After hashing for something like 50 years, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> openly commiserated if 
he should give up hashing.  Hashing just doesn’t get any better than this!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was so severely wounded from the briars, that mere mortals would be unable to 
walk.  However, the potent narcotics (compliments of <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>) urged him to quickly start 
back on trail.  In typical hap-hazard fashion, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> ignored the marks and short-cutted 
true trail and led the pack a whopping 200 yards directly to the beer check (Brilliant!).  With a “BN” marked on an 
old, dilapidated, rat-infested barn, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
hurriedly (stupidly) ran through the barn and continued on a dirt road.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, the 
only “thinking” hasher this evening, easily found the beer in an adjacent barn.  200 yards past the beer check, 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> finally turned around to join the 
others.  With a terrified group huddled inside the barn, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had the brilliant idea 
to try to barricade the doors to keep <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> out.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 
feeling no pain, easily broke through this futile barricade.  They gave up and instead savored the fine Imperial Stout 
and refreshing Dogfish Head IPA offered by the hare.</p>

<p>Expecting a crowd from nearby Newport (yeah, right!) and five promised virgins (yeah, right!), the hare brought 
enough beer for a small army.  They broke into song.  The piles of horse manure under their feet inspired a 
pathetic impromptu version of “Sweet Violets.”  Despite being on a farm, no amount of singing could make anyone's 
rhubarb rise.  There was, however, an ode to <font color="#FF0000">FMT's</font> pubic hairs.  Finishing their beers, 
they were off.  Directed by the hare, they headed east along a dirt road to a bone check (what the f**k’s a bone 
check?).  With the drugs finally wearing off, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> floundered in the back of the 
pack.  This caused the others, particularly the visitors, to run faster.  True trail was north, along a small paved 
road, passing some houses.  The FRB <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> came across an arrow pointing east into 
an open field.  He followed the marks leading into a large excavated hole filled with black muck and probably some 
toxic waste dump.  Nobody except <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> followed, so they turned around to join 
the others.</p>

<p>As it got dark, all safely reached the hare’s car in a small lot along 
Eight Rod Way.  Three teenage boys, returning from fishing, rather wanking, in a nearby pond, were 
inquisitive of the hashers.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> did not pass up the opportunity to 
try to recruit (sexually molest) these youthful virgins for the 2015 hash season.  Circle was held 
in a nearby field.  As they started “Monks of St. Bernard” <font color="#FF0000">Fudgy</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> took things too seriously, and actually did turn the green 
leaves yellow.  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, not knowing if he was still hallucinating from 
the Thai smack, spotted a mysterious boat approaching the circle.  They all looked around to 
determine if they had mistakenly circled in a lake.  Perhaps they did – a mystery to be solved.</p>

<p>Comments on the run:  Virgin territory (Excellent!), copious shiggy 
(Fantastic!), <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> (Unbelievable!), no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> and no <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> (Incredible!), a single malt whisky check 
(Spectacular!), fine beer in a barn full of shit (Terrific!), a clay pigeon 6.9 back check 
(Extraordinary!), 3 visitors from 2 states (Wow!).  <b>Total: +0.69</b>.  Another brilliant run 
by the legendary <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>.  The only negatives: Nobody lost (ala 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>), lack of promised virgins, and horrible hashing weather (see <a 
href="http://members.cox.net/rih3/hhh990.html" target=new>#990</a> for perfect hashing weather).  
Nevertheless, it was still a strong contender for Hash of the Year!  Hashit: <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> for his brilliant pre-emptive write-up.  And to 
commemorate the return of <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
tried to sing “Irian Jaya.”  Pathetic.  Down downs for the visitors and <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font> the backslider.</p>

<p>They headed to Li’l Bear Lounge for On-on-on and pizza and beer.  
<font color="#FF0000">FMT</font> went straight home, as she suffered from nausea due to all the blood 
on trail.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> were 
mysteriously absent as well.  They finally arrived and shared a horrific tale of being apprehended by 
the DEM police just as they left the management area parking lot.  Apparently there had been a recent 
crack down on area parking lots for rampant homosexual activity.  For we’re all queers together, 
that’s why we go out in pairs (but I digress).  Unlike <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot’s</font> smart thinking and quick action permitted the law enforcement 
officer to set them free without incident.  Unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> had 
to perform sexual acts on the officer, and vice versa.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> stood by 
and watched with a big grin.  Hashing doesn’t get any better than this!</p>

<p>Everyone was starving from the fine evening’s adventures, and they quickly 
devoured four large pizzas, leaving nothing for poor <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font>.  Song broke 
out and the other patrons quickly (smartly) disappeared.  By now, even <font color="#FF0000">Fudgy</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Pud Pirate</font> eagerly sang along (it was probably the beer).  
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, apparently going mad from too many RIH3 hashes, started 
piecing together verses of “Bang My Balls” in some kind of Hawaiian accent.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, already gone mad, joined <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> in 
this obscure song.  The typical shenanigans ensued.. blah, blah, blah.  $10 each (Brilliant!).  And 
another complete waste of an evening concluded, with <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> regretting 
ever leaving Thailand.</p>
