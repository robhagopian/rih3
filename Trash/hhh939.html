<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The familiar territory of Tarbox Pond and Big River drew all the regulars for the first time in quite a while. Or 
perhaps it was the hare’s promises of virgin trail, midgets, freaks and strippers that drew everyone out this Monday. But 
most likely, it was the hope that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> would again be misled into making endless circles 
around Carr Pond. That, and the fine weather.</p>

<p>The hare sent them off across Hopkins Hill Rd heading west. A falsie sent most except for <font color="#FF0000">
SESYB </font> noisily and moistly across the Carr River. A family out for a nature walk with the kids, was mightily amused 
by this. Trail led up to an old quarry, and then around the quarry to the New London Tnpk. There was some confusion here, 
but after a brief pavement stretch northeast on the road, they found a bushwhack east across and back to Hopkins Hill Rd. 
The woods were re-entered by a cemetery.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>now led as the trail descended, approaching but never reaching Tarbox Pond. A falsie 
led <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> through a fine swamp. Caught but never 
despairing, they hollered “On On!” until <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was drawn into the same error. Meanwhile,
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> became FRB and led up switchbacks northeast slightly away from the pond. Trail turned 
east. A large number of old marks were seen, testifying to the hare’s quality brand of flour many months before.</p>

<p>They crossed the small swamp and stream at the head of Tarbox Pond and passed through some stagnant mud, finding a “BN” 
near the base of a glacial cliff. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> made it to the top first. The beer was found and 
opened. The peace of the beer check was soon interrupted by the arrival of first <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, and 
then latecummer <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> running in sandals. He was challenged, and started to come straight 
up the face of the rock. Unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
could not produce enough urine above him to make this interesting. But at least they tried. (And <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> was able to produce some solid waste a few minutes later.)</p>

<p>After a while, the hare set out to live-hare the on in. Soon following was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and then 
the rest. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> chose to descend the rock face sliding on his posterior, secure in the layers 
of Kevlar in his outfit. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> followed suit, and was later seen asking <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> where he gets his gear. Trail led west, and the swamp bridge at the north corner of the pond 
was crossed. It was easily followed to a promontory on the north shore, where the hare had laid a fire next to a tarpaulin 
left by some fishermen. The fine drizzle was mostly over, so the shelter was not used, and the beer was brought out. The 
circle was begun.</p>

<p>The ratings were reflective of the hare’s broken promises. No midgets. No strippers. No lost <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font>. And <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> the FRB! Total -0.69. Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
for sliding down the rock and not getting injured. After swinging low, they headed back to the cars, and then drove to 
exit 6 not 6A. The hare couldn’t face another grilled veggie plate while inhaling cigarette smoke, so he wanked off into 
the night. The rest enjoyed the usual fare with little fuss, and no singing.</p>
