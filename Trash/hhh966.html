<p><i><b>Pre-lube:</b>  This hash was the Scribe's second hash with RIH3.  And this hash occurred on October 11, 2004 
and its hash trash written on April 13, 2005.  It should go without saying that, while the best attempts were made to 
keep the factual record straight, don't count on it.  Most of this account of RIH3 Hash #966 <b>never</b> happened.  
However, being that it was a <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> hash, most would wish it never happened anyway.  
Hence recorded history will be better than reality.</i></p>

<p>The group of wankers was instructed to gather in the parking lot behind a hardware store off 146 and on 146A.  
<font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> showed up early to an awaiting <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> in <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font> car, obviously getting in a quicky before the 
run.  Sadly, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was there too, but that didn't stop the lustful libations.  However, 
the fogged up windows in <font color="#FF0000">Tinker's</font> car made <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> wonder 
who was getting more action.  Apparently, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> wasn't getting any action tonight, for 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was not there.  Then <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived to restore order, 
and then <font color="#FF0000">Flounder</font> from the cheese state arrived to restore chaos.  <font color="#FF0000">
Just Bert </font> wanted to leave, but was too stupid to.  The hare arrived, and they were off.</p>

<p>The pack crossed 146A heading north along the obvious power lines.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> who has 
this territory ingrained in memory (and pees on every available tree to mark the territory as his) quickly took the 
lead and left the others in his dust.  Up a hill, down a hill... blah, blah, blah.  Trail bent westward and the wankers 
made it to Central St. and followed some inconsistent marks southward where the hare waited in his Vanagan parked in 
an industrial parking lot.  An obvious and much needed beer check.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> made mention of 
a police cruiser, which was ominous forshadowing for next week's hash (see Hash Trash "Reservoir Dogs in Woonsocket").  
Beer was savored, but <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was still missing.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> being <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided to go back and look for the 
lost hasher <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>.  Little that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> knew, <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was still back in his car savoring the pornographic images compliments of <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>.  Or, perhaps <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
wanted to join him, as anything was better than watching <font color="#FF0000">Flounder</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> engage in some intellecutal discussion about beer and cheese.  <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> feeling 
ill over the conversation between <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Flounder</font> sat 
alone and away from the others.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> made strange calls from his slide whistle trying 
to gain the attention of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and/or <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> nervously drank his beer and just wanted to go home.  Finally, the hashers were off 
again, heading south along Central St.</p>

<p>A check was reached at the corner of Rt. 5 and Rt. 102 (Victory highway).  <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> 
headed east along Rt. 102 and forgot to look for marks.  The hashers with brains (and the ones without) correctly 
continued south along Rt. 5.  It did not take too long for <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> to correct himself, 
and he quickly came upon and passed the over-sexed and exhausted <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> wasn't sure, but he thought he saw an euphoric 
grin on <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font> face, but it was dark out.  He quickly came upon <font color="#FF0000">
Flounder</font> and wondered if this was a smart move.  As a novice hasher, <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> showed 
the requisite signs of lack of judgement and absolutely no common sense.  Surely, with these fine skills, <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> would take him under his wings (and/or under the table).</p>

<p>They reached a check at the intersection of North Main St, Main St, Green St, School St, and Railroad St.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font>, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Flounder</font> must have spent 30 minutes wandering aimlessly about trying to find true trail, only to 
be circle-jerked by the hare.  Finally, the hare (idiot) in his Vanagan drove by, and yelled out "The other side of 
the road!"  Apparently, the hare (fool) set trail on his bicycle, thus all the marks were on the wrong side of the road.  
Well, right side of the road for the idiot running wankers.  West on School St., north on Maple Ave., and west again on 
146A to the cars.  Thank God!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was waiting with an euphoric grin on his face, but <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font> was missing.  No more needs to be said.  Circle was held.  Comments on the run:  nobody remembers, but 
the cumulative ratings equaled a +0.0000000069 mostly for <font color="#FF0000">SESYB's</font> residual pherimones.  
Down-downs for the hare and visitor.  Hashit went to... <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">
Just Bert</font> was in a state of shock, so he followed the others to Bondo's for the On-on-on.</p>

<p>The f**king hare fed the f**king hashers f**king chili, and he told them that if they didn't f**king like the 
so-called f**king food they could leave and go f**k themselves.  And if they did like the f**king chili, the f**ks 
could still leave and go f**k themselves, because the f**king hare doesn't f**king care.  Fortunately, <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> was still in a state of f**king shock, thus didn't really witness what was f**king 
happening.  <font color="#FF0000">Flounder</font>, being a f**king cheese-head, didn't eat f**king meat.  Er, he didn't 
eat <i>that</i> kind of f**king meat, so he confessed.  Nobody wanted further f**king clarification, thus thankfully 
ending the most f**king pathetic evening of their f**king lives.</p>

<p><i><b>Backwash:</b>  The Scribe (now <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>) admits that the above recollection 
has been a recurring traumatic nightmare.  His psychiatrist (who will be referred to by initials only, Dr. O.S.D.) told 
his patient <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> that the only way to overcome this psychological trauma is to bring 
it all into the open and confront the nightmarish events.  Unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> 
re-visits this unfortunate and hellish experience every Monday night.  Perhaps he should see another doctor.  But 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>?</p>
