<p><font color="#008000">Run #1002</font>, June 13, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Old Furnace State Park, S. Killingly, CT.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 80’s, humid and hazy.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Oozing SD, SESYB, Just Michelle, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS, 
Fuwangi Boner, Tinker, Bondo Jovi, Seamus, Ben. Visitors: Sparky the Hobosexual (NH3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Frustrated by his inability to attract the cowardly members of the RIH3 to one of his rock climbing ventures, 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, the hare, decided to approach this from another angle. He set a hash from 
a well-known Connecticut cliff-climbing venue and homosexual meeting place. This was sure to attract a crowd. The first 
arrival, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was greeted by the hare and several alternately nubile and scruffy 
teenaged delinquents. The teens were being surreptitiously fed beer by the hare. They were apparently rock climbers. 
Right! The two hashers were soon joined by <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> from Newport, and then <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> with not only <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> but also <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Michelle</font>. Another blatant attempt by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to bribe the hash! They prelubed with 
beer, bug repellant and ivy block. But they delayed too long. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and, worst of all, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> arrived. But at least no <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, thank God. Count your blessings while you can!</p>

<p>Just after 6:30 they headed on out, northeast on the access road. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> chose to 
avoid the pavement and found a path in the woods just south of the road. They soon came upon true trail. The rest soon 
turned in at a check, but the head start allowed <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to follow a prolonged falsie east, 
calling the rest behind him. He tried to sneak around back behind them in the bushes. Ha Ha! They turned back as a 
group, and found true trail southwest towards Ross pond.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/Oozerunning.JPG"><br><br>Oozing in the lead, so fast he’s a 
blur!<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>It was as a group then, that they paralleled the pond south. It was overly marked. There was no shiggy. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was now leading. Boring! The trail led finally to an embankment at Rt 695. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> climbed down and tried luring the pack into a chest-high flow in a tunnel under the 
highway. As always, he was ignored. They crossed over west and turned northwest up along the far side of the pond. 
Circumnavigating a pond! Too bad <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> wasn’t there. Or wasn’t he?</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/UpperPond.JPG"><br><br>“Let’s Run around this!”<br>&nbsp;</p>
</center>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> by now had taken advantage of his superior speed and inferior intellect. He was 
thus way out in front. [This allows him to magnify his many errors, so it is not discouraged.] He came to a check. A 
falsie was straight and he returned to find true trail reversing and returning southwest. The pack was close enough to 
hear him, so most followed. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> reasoned that an 
“X” would only be placed if the hare didn’t want one to go that way. And the trail was blazed in blue. Just like 
the North-South trail! They decided to defy the hare and they continued north along the shoreline. This is just what 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> would have done!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> by now was chasing <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. He made some bad 
decisions as well, and ended up leading <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> (but no one else) into a nice little 
swamp, providing the only shiggy of the run. But eventually they all caught on and, more or less together they found 
true trail turning west then uphill. They turned north on a ridge. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, meanwhile, had 
finally come to a check well ahead of the pack. He decided to continue on the blue-blazed trail rather than the 
smaller trails close to the water. A check sent him uphill on unmarked paths, following an awful, but strangely 
familiar scent. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> recognized the danger of following <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font>. He paralleled the base of the hill briefly, on true trail.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/Rock.JPG"><br><br>The first ledge.<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>Emerging out of the trees, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was proved right for once. He had found marks. But 
he paid for his good luck by coming across <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font>! <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was 
near! <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> vowed never to shortcut again. As he came to the first ledges, he met 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, beer mugs in hand. Not wishing to exert 
themselves or to spill any beer, they had decided to try the obvious and search for the beer check on the cliffs. The 
motley trio, as fine and accurate a representation of RI hashing as one could ever want, proceeded together on trail. 
This led north along the ledge-tops. They came to the main overlook and found a rock climber and girlfriend drinking 
Coronas (some Mexican drink, possibly a form of weak tea or filtered urine or something). The climbers could not give 
any clues. But there was plenty of time. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> finally found the black garbage bag. They 
decided to relocate.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/WHOCliff.JPG"><br><br>The second ledge. WHO liked the 
view.<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>Enjoying beer within earshot of the first cliff, they had found a second outlook, equally scenic. All too soon, the 
others arrived at the “B”. Visible through the bushes, their efforts at finding beer were comical. But all too soon, 
<font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> tore himself away from his master and yet again exposed <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s 
</font>hiding place. The Woonsocket police can rest easy. The group rejoined. But <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had hidden the remaining jugs of beer in the bushes. Another great and original 
joke! Ha Ha!</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/MichelleCliff.JPG"><br><br>“Isn’t there supposed to be beer 
somewhere?”<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/FuwangiCliff.JPG"><br><br>“Sh*t! Where’s the f**kin’ 
beer?”<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/WIPOSetalCliff.JPG"><br><br>“You guys look for it! I’m too 
busy!”<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/BondoLaugh.JPG"><br><br>“Gotcha, 
asso’s!”<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>So the beer found, they enjoyed a rest with a view. <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> commented: “You guys don’t 
sing like we do in Newport.” The result was predictable.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/SparkyCliff.JPG"><br><br>“Just take four steps backward. It’ll 
be a better angle.”<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/DryFootetal1.JPG"><br><br>“How about you, WIPOS? Want your 
picture taken?”<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>The rhubarb refused to rise, the engineer’s wife was satisfied, the pilot was fit, etc. etc. etc. The climbers on 
the neighboring ledge were soon driven away. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> pissed. <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Michelle</font> continued to photograph the event.</p>

<p>Finally the beer was gone. On out trail was led by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi 
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. They continued north and soon descended to a check. Going straight 
they came to a “Check Back 11”, after crossing a small stream bed. Looking at their fingers, they realized that none 
of them could reliably count above ten. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, still holding a beer, couldn’t guarantee 
anything above 5. They had no choice but to continue. They reasoned that the hare would go around the upper pond as 
well. Wrong! But their shouts of “On On!” as well as some meaty profanities at least drew <font color="#FF0000">Oozing 
</font>to follow. The rest stuck with the hare. They doubled back on the west side of the pond and went directly to 
the parking lot. Over on the east side of the pond, fortune was favoring the mentally handicapped. A trail led to the 
lot as well. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> found his own unique way back. Some time later.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/OozeRunning2.JPG"><br><br>Oozing. DFL, but still a 
blur!<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>The circle was joined in Ross pond. This proved less enticing than it first seemed. The water temperature was 
uncomfortably hot and standing or moving about released clouds of foul-smelling gas. Leeches were present. But at 
least <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> found a new temporary Hashit, to replace the one lost in Squannakonk Swamp.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/Hashit1.JPG"><br><br>A new Hashit, made to 
order?<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>Ratings for the run: virgin territory, bimbos, a fine outlook, mosquitoes and leeches vs. no bushwhacking, no 
thorns, no poison ivy, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> at the beer check, and no losses. Total: 6.9!</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/DFFinCircle.JPG"><br><br>The hare being punished. Note the 
water clarity.<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>Hashit was given from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to: <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. But 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, hiding in the long grasses near the shore, had taken off his shoes to keep them 
dry! Pathetic. He was given his just rewards, and turned the new Hashit into a useful object.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1002/FloatingHashit2.JPG"><br><br>A new use for the Hashit.
<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>Next, attempts were made at naming <font color="#FF0000">Just Michelle</font>. Her photographic efforts were 
cited. The best of these efforts was “Flasher” [No one could do justice to the location of her camera, nestled in 
her cleavage. All were too busy racking (ha, ha!) their brains to think of a way to get the camera to activate 
itself.] <font color="#FF0000">“Pond Her (on it)”</font> was the ultimate choice and deserves to die in obscurity 
before anyone is tempted to use it. They gave up when <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> started “Singin’ in the 
Rain.” <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> wished he had never said a word about singing.</p>

<p>After swinging low, and drying off, they drove to the On On On, at the remodelling Bishop Hill Tavern. The Red 
Sox were winning, the food was forthcoming, the songs were plentiful and the waitress was unhappy. <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Michelle</font> received her first “Alouette”. We must be trying to lose this one. Don’t listen 
to us, <font color="#FF0000">Just Michelle</font>! We want you back! We don’t mean any harm! Show us your …! Oops!</p>
