<p>The Run:</p>

<p>Barrington, Rhode Island is one 
of those special communities for special people. Like Chestnut Hill, Grosse 
Point, Bel Air and others, when you move to Barrington you become a part of the 
elite. For some hashers, this means an end to their childish ways and a welcome 
matriculation into the world of adults. Thus when the hare EverReady decided to 
set trail in this jewel of the East Bay, all knew that they must be on their 
best behaviour. They prepared accordingly. They chose their most reputable 
shiggy shoes. They bathed thoroughly on Saturday night. They studied their 
Reader’s Digests’ “Improve Your Vocabulary” sections. They color coordinated. It 
was a group very different from the usual that gathered that night. They met at 
the former site of the Barrington Police Department, perhaps making a symbolic 
statement of their resolve to reform. In Barrington, one must learn to hash like 
ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> were the first to arrive. Dr WHO 
commented admiringly on <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> boots (Vasque 
Sundowners, $180.00 retail) and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> returned the 
compliment vocally praising the practicality of <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> 
trail shoes (Montrail Hurricane Ridge GTX with Integrafit, at about $115.00). 
Next arriving were <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> (in his Helly Hansen 
Lhotse Jacket, $160.00), <font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain</font> (fully prepared 
in Sierra Designs Peak Bagger XV, at $219.00), and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi 
Boner</font> (wearing Obermeyer from head to toe: Hat - $22.00, Jacket - 
$189.50, and Gore-tex pants - $229.50). <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> wore 
his usual lab coat (but underneath was layered exclusively in Kenyon (tops- 
$24.00, bottoms - $24.00), with Thorlos ($15.50) and a Hind Sports Bra 
($35.00)). The hare greeted the arrivals with an aperitif of Limonciello (Banfi 
Villa Grazia - $14.95), and admired how all had risen to the occasion.</p>

<p>Those missing were discussed.
<font color="#FF0000">Swallows My Pride</font> had suffered a crisis when she 
realized that her new nail laminates clashed with her only clean running suit. 
She was still waiting for her laundry delivery. <font color="#FF0000">Raging 
Queen</font> was afraid of the possible beer choices in the “Land of 
Chardonnay”. <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> was on his way from a power lunch 
meeting in ‘the city’. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>had text-messaged 
that he and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> were en route, but his Beamer (MSRP 
about $46,000.00) had been a bit sluggish off the stoplights recently so he had 
stopped briefly at his garage to have his man check the timing. This left
<font color="#FF0000">Async.</font> Unaccounted for yet again in a Barrington 
hash. Well, it is probably understandable given how prominent he is in the town 
being a bank executive and all. If he were seen with the hash, that would be the 
end of his chances to get elected Commodore of the Barrington Yacht Club for 
sure!</p>

<p>The run started by heading 
towards the bike path where a check sent half the group across the Barrington 
River towards New Meadow Neck and the home of the hare. (This is unfortunately 
not the fashionable part of town. But the hare is a widowed young mother. You 
can’t have that sort of demographic too close to Nayatt Road! What would the 
kids think? At any rate I am sure <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> has plans to 
move to Rumstick Point after he makes an honest woman of her this spring. And 
what hashes we’ll have out there!) Coming back, they were joined by
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB the Hoover</font>. 
The trail led west along the bike path and crossed County Road. Some of the 
group were distracted by a sale on misses’ accessories at Talbot’s. Fortunately 
for the hash (as anyone should know) they close at 6PM. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> made a note to themselves 
to return the next day to search for that perfect skirt. But Starbucks AND 
Borders Books were open.&nbsp; It nearly ended there.</p>

<p>Finally trail was found leading 
into some woods behind the Barrington Shopping Center. These centrally located 
woods known locally as the “Great Barrington Wilderness”, are preserved for the 
enjoyment of all as a spot where one can seek solitude and get back to nature in 
its primal state. All ten acres are pristine (except of course for the graded 
and manicured trails crossing behind Brickyard Pond), and the area is a fine 
example of southern New England Cedar wetlands.&nbsp; The hashers split up trying to 
find trail. <font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> led with their usual speed, taking care not to exceed 80% of 
their maximal heart rate of course. This led to their complete confusion as 
their hare had been a crafty minx, and had chosen this locale to conserve on 
flour (Wades Mill Stone Ground Semolina Flour, $4.00 for 5lb.).
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
continued straight and temporarily audited a Cardio-Kickboxing class at the 
Barrington YMCA. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> went back to the bike path. 
He met a female jogger in the dark. He stopped to suggest helpfully that she 
might want some new headlights&nbsp; (Petzl Duo LED 5, $77.00). <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>was distracted when he spied what he thought was a giant Blue Tit 
(<i>parus caeruleus</i>) on a swamp maple branch. But it was only a
<font color="#FF0000">Swallow</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>finally showed some sense. They followed the hare.</p>

<p>It turned out that this foray 
into the wild was only a brief respite. The trail circled back out to Rumstick 
Road. They ran south and then did a loop west again, this time on pavement in an 
area where the Neighborhood Watch is notoriously tolerant. They ran back out to 
the road and then east towards the river on Chapin St.. The BC was found.
<font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
were first to arrive and found Guinness and some other sort of beer-like 
substance in plain view in the backyard of a house undergoing an addition. They 
helped themselves to the stout, and thought it would be jolly fun if they hid 
the good stuff so the rest would have to drink like they do in Connecticut. 
Naturally the joke went over smashingly.&nbsp; All arrived eventually, and
<font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> even came up with some better ale. The dogs 
were joined by <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, an occasional hash dog owned 
by the hare’s sister. They frolicked, and attempted amatory advances upon each 
other and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. The hare and her sister (at whose 
home the hospitality was being shared) pointed out that there were ordinances 
against this sort of thing in Barrington. Extensive debates were held as to the 
advisability of taking this dog-and-hasher show on the road and making a stop at 
chez <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. But it was decided to have mercy. The 
group headed back out to Mathewson Lane and thence back north to the parking area.</p>

<p>As the hashers arrived, they 
broke out the Frisbees (World Class Ultimate Frisbee, 175 g, $10.50) and had a 
spirited game of Ultimate Frisbee, the “ultimate” part being the part where
<font color="#FF0000">ultimately</font> the discs sailed into the river and were 
lost. They circled up at the water’s edge using a yacht dinghy to hold the beer. 
Ratings for the run were: “charming!”, “totally awesome!”, “a glorious outing!”, 
and “Everready, you the man!”. Total: -6.9! Who could think of hashit on a night 
like this? It must have been given to <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> but 
your scribe, suffused with the glow of his memories, cannot recall. Some fine 
singing, sips of beer, and good cheer predominated. The circle ended on a mellow note.</p>

<p>Not trusting the ability of 
the hasher to maintain their good behaviour at Barrington’s only restaurant (the 
Kozy Kitchen), the hare recommended a trip to Warren to The Tinker’s Nest. They 
all made it out of Barrington safely to Tinkers, where there are still no shamus 
and ‘where everybody knows your name’. [Actually, this is because the place 
always seems to empty out as soon as the hash arrives. I can’t think why.]&nbsp; They 
enjoyed wings and cheeseburgers (Monday Night Special $1.00), and Trinity IPA on 
tap. The Jukebox played Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles, with some Moby and Bush 
for the younger set. The older crowd assembled their darts (Bottlesen 
Hammerheads, 5/16” - $77.99) and enjoyed the ambiance with a hot latte. This 
refined style of hashing seemed to suit the ‘new’ RIH3. Everyone called for more 
runs outside of the Glendale/Mark’s/Parente’s triad. It was agreed: “Today: 
Barrington! Tomorrow: East Greenwich!”</p>
