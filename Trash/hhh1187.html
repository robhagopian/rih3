<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">For the New 
Years Hash, the hare had been promised a deal on beer if the On On On were to be 
held at the Mews Tavern. Always one to take advantage of free beer, he planned 
accordingly, and set yet another brilliant virgin territory run at Old Mountain 
Park in South Kingston. The 2 PM start time assured good attendance, and the far 
south location assured no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! What could be 
better? How about a champagne check as well as a beer check, to celebrate the 
season!<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" 
/><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The trail 
started by the tennis courts at the entrance to the park. Heading east, a few 
checks were easily dealt with, as they climbed Old Mountain, and then headed 
down to the north bank of the Indian Run Reservoir. Only <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> decided to cross the ramshackle bridge at the head 
of the pond. The rest found true trail heading back uphill. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> encountered the latecummer <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. He turned back. <FONT color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT> 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>Dogmeat</FONT> tried a shortcut at the other end of the 
pond. No luck there, either.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail led up to 
a bike path, and continued east into some playing fields. A long “trombone” 
check had <FONT color=#ff0000>Sloppy Rod</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> heading the wrong way on some powerlines. Basket 
unfortunately rejoined the group and ran around aimlessly through the ball 
fields. <FONT color=#ff0000>Cumsocket To Me</FONT> followed the hare as he 
turned south on the powerlines. She and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Crack-her-toe-ah</FONT> led the pack through an overgrown and very 
thorny path to the river. There was some residual ice, but not enough to keep 
the feet dry. The hare showed the way, straight across. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>found another route where a fallen tree provided 
some relief from the cold water. But one had to traverse 20 yds of freezing 
mud-pools to get there.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail continued 
east along a stone wall. An arrow turned the pack north, back to the river. 
Again, two choices: straight across, up to the knees, or across on the stone 
wall, through dense briars. Most chose wisely. They came up to the fields they 
had left just before, and a “C” check. The champagne was found, and opened. A 
few songs were sung, and the hare tried to make something of “Should <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket Boom Boom</FONT> be forgot”. Didn’t get too far with 
that.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">After the bubbly 
was gone, the hare directed them back the way they came. Another river crossing! 
Fantastic! Incredible! Trail crossed the stonewall heading south. They came out 
into a new development with no houses yet built. Trail was found turning west 
along the retention ponds. It then turned back into the woods, following the 
muddiest available route back to the powerlines. After a short distance 
southwest on the lines, they came upon <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, 
searching for beer. He was standing right next to it, and still missed it. The 
BC was in the woods next to a makeshift tent with a soaked mattress, and other 
amenities such as a collapsing chair which <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> 
seemed to be fond of. The usual fine beers and snacks were broken out, and songs 
were sung. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">After 
frightening some 14 year-olds who had been out for a smoke in the woods, the 
group gathered and tried to find the trail back. A nice, well-marked path had 
been set, but <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> was enamored by the tilted 
bridge he had encountered before. So most simply crossed over (with a few near 
misses on the slippery structure) and turned west back to the park and the cars. 
The circle was held just inside the woods above the tennis 
courts.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The run was 
rated. Virgin territory, 4 bimbos, no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>multiple river crossings, and briars. No 
one could think of anything bad to say. So the hare received a -6.9! Hashit was 
given to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, for finding <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. They finished up and reconvened at the Mews, where 
they were greeted by <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Katie</FONT>. Some food and beer 
were brought out. Some singing began. A football watching patron didn’t like the 
songs during the game. Let's face it. He really didn't like <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>. <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and he came 
close to making this a perfect afternoon by getting everyone thrown out before 
paying, but he was restrained by <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>. You can’t 
have everything.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
