<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">The Run:</span></p>

<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">This was another contender for hash
of the year. Modesty
prevents your scribe from doing more than a summary. The group was
nearly
dispersed by a policeman before they'd even arrived. The silver-tongued
hare
convinced him that this was not a group of aging homosexuals from RI.
This was
an adventurous and athletic group of runners out for an evening run.
Making
this remotely plausible takes some doing! And <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Pubic Housing</span>
hadn't even arrived
yet. So they were off at six-thirty promptly. Trail led across the
field
heading east.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The trail entered the woods. The
first check tempted <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span>
to head uphill on some powerlines. The rest found true trail
bush-whacking down
to a stream bed. The stream was easily crossed. The marks led south.
They went
parallel to the stream. Trail went up to and over a large slippery
boulder. It
went down to a check on a slippery path. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket </span>went up.
The rest went back
down to the stream bed. Trail crossed through a boggy patch. Some got
their
feet wet. They whined. WAAH!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Trail went uphill through the bushes.
A poorly maintained
path was encountered. This led them up to&Eacute; the powerlines. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span> was
chagrined. They came to a check. This led to an elaborate series of
brilliant
false trails going back to the stream. But <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Concrete</span> found
true trail continuing
southwest on the powerlines. He called the rest on. The hare was
chagrined.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">They soon turned off the powerlines.
They came to a quarry.
After some false starts, they skirted the lower end of the excavation
and
turned west into the bushes. They were spread out somewhat. But no one
was
lost. Not even <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span>.
They crossed some marshy areas and started uphill.
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Concrete</span>
led. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Justin My Ass</span>
was not far behind. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span>
started to get lost.
Things were looking up. A path was encountered and followed. They
finally came
out to&Eacute; some different powerlines. And the beer check! This
was after a few
checks and about a half mile of mixed trail and bush-whacking. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The
hare brought out the beer without any annoying
hide-and-seek games. Good! <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span>
eventually appeared at the beer check. Bad!
Beer was enjoyed. There were nuts as well. Not just the participants. A
few
songs were sung to drown out the drone of traffic on <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rt</span></span>
95. They finished up. They moved on.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Trail led northeast on the powerlines
for a short distance.
A check led to some most interesting garbage. Most stopped to try out
some
furniture. Or perhaps a discarded bicycle. But trail led east again. It
was
mostly dirt bike paths and old dirt roads. There were many abandoned
cars. <span class="GramE">And other distractions.</span>
But trail was well marked. It took
them down into a valley and then up to the Standpipes on Ides Hill.
They came
down the hill to the cars.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The
circle was held within plain sight of the road. The hare
was hoping to get them arrested. No such luck. The run was rated. Good
shiggy.
Virgin Territory. No pavement. No commas or parentheses in the
write-up.
However! No one lost. No precipitation. And no one had seen the
write-up.
Total: -0.69. <span class="SpellE">Hashit</span>: <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Oozing</span> received
the dishonor.
He had not taken advantage of the discarded bicycles. They finished the
circle.
The On <span class="SpellE">On</span> <span class="SpellE">On</span> was at <span class="SpellE">Wetherlaines</span>. It was fine.
Except the one bimbo didn't
show. So it was another gay time for the RIH3.</p>
