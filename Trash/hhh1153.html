virgin territory from the Fish Road Park-and-Ride in Tiverton. And it was 
delivered in what was a strong contender for Hash-of-the-Year! A Mexican theme 
was offered, but no sombreros or serapes were seen. <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> arrived and made everyone wait for <font color="#ff0000">Europeein’ Whore</font> and another visitor. 
At 6:40, the visitors were finally contacted, and said they were just leaving 
Albany or something. So, the hash started off.</font></span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font color="#000000">Trail began, 
crossing Fish Road and entering the woods behind the Mercedes dealer, heading 
west. The shiggy was dense, and although <font color="#ff0000">Basket </font>tried early to get lost, he was forced onto 
the proper trail at the beginning. Trail paralleled Rt. 24 west and soon turned 
north to a check that had the pack confused for a moment. But eventually, trail 
was resumed. They came out on Sousa Rd. <br>

<font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> was first to find a turn back into the woods, 
just east of a reclaimed “superfund” site. With a slight whiff of toxic 
chemicals spurring them on, the pack climbed uphill and north to encounter a 
Turkey-Eagle split. The hare recommended that those with dogs take the Turkey. 
<font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> followed suit. <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> went his own way. The main trail crossed through a 
small gap in some barbed-wire into a field. The field contained large and 
suspicious brown piles of shite. No, it was not <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> ’s vacation home. It was the 
home of the Tiverton herd of Highland cattle. Fortunately, the animals were 
confined to the lower forty, and were not seen.<br>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><font color="#000000">Finally, the pack 
was together as they came out through a second barbed-wire gap onto some 
powerlines. <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi </font>and <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> led right and they came to the Tequila Check. Fine 100% 
blue agave “Plata” was opened, with lime wedges and salt. Chips were opened. It 
was fine, until <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> arrived. So, very quickly they returned west 
on the powerlines. Trail led down into thicker and thicker briars, and 
confusion, profanity and generalized whining ensued. But, a quick but 
well-hidden left led to the true trail out to Main Road.<br>

the Li’l Bear Lounge, and down into the construction site end of the Starwoods 
Condo development. Crossing down steep gravel slopes, they came to a tidal pool 
and a dirt path. <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>, yet again, was nowhere to be 
seen. Trail led around the tidal marsh and curved back south on the shores of 
the Bay to the BC. Beer was brought out, along with a can of Portuguese Octopus, 
and spiced nuts. Things were looking up. But then, atop the gravel mountain, a 
lone figure appeared. Too late! <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> saw 
them.<br>

group, and immediately called <font color="#ff0000">Europeein’ </font>on his cell. 
She apparently had made it as far as Tiverton. Basket handed the phone to the 
hare, <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> tried to give directions to her passenger 
<font color="#ff0000">Emu</font>. There was some difficulty because of a language 
barrier. Both were speaking English. Finally, just as the group packed up to 
move on, the visitors were seen pulling into the parking lot for The Boathouse 
Restaurant. The pack followed trail up to a sand bar where the rising tide had 
made a trickle into a river. The hare, <font color="#ff0000">LFE </font>and <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> crossed waist deep in fine tidal shiggy to the dry 
ground. <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> circled back and joined the 
visitors on the dry path to the prominence.<br>

circle up. Ratings for the run were artificially altered by the confused 
visitors who gave very high marks. <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> whined 
about getting lost, <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font> whined about pavement, 
<font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> whined about the fishy smell from the 
Portuguese octopus and <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> said he had been gonna 
use this trail before, but decided against it. Total: -0.69. Rank jealousy, I 
say! Hashit to <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> , for whining and carrying 
on.<br>

to Li’l Bear with the visitors. The hare led <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> on true 
trail along the water and then uphill back to the hare’s home, (where a trip to 
the bathroom in the hare’s kitchen by <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font>             
               
                
   may have scarred the hare’s daughter for life!). They then 
drove back to Fish Road and the cars. They all met up in Li’l Bear, which now 
has a cheap menu available for Monday nights. They sat at the usual table next 
to the statue of the namesake small bear, and another hash came to a 
close.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p>
