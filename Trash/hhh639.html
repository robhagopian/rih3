Portsmouth Boat Yard</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;
<BR>Evil Bitch, as she is appropriately known in the Newport Hash, no longer
confused as Sweet Adorable, volunteered as Hare for the RIH3 in Portsmouth.&nbsp;
Right at the Dunkin Donuts on 114 to the Boat Yard.&nbsp; Simple enough
directions, but right from the start we should have anticipated trouble.&nbsp;
The Hare had this deliciously evil smile on her face as she sent her co-hare
Bush Yaaker off with a bag of flour…straight uphill.&nbsp; Minutes later
we were on trail following the bastard, but EB was waiting at the cars,
possibly for latecumers (we thought), but as we found out much later, for
us to return from our climb back downhill.&nbsp; It was a circle jerk falsie
and everyone was caught by the ruse.

<P>I caught up with Bondo and Tinker who happened to catch a ride with
latecumer Oozing at the top of the hill and all three were following the
tracks at the bottom on right.&nbsp; I searched the road leading right
and found WIPOS and Dr Quim, but no flour.&nbsp; Then I traveled on the
left road and into a parking lot, which led to the beach and flour along
the barnacle, incrusted rocks.&nbsp; Oozing led the pack, which was minus
Tinker, Bondo, and WIPOS, along the rocks, across a swampy field and onto
the RR Tracks, which led past the wide-eyed Park Police.&nbsp; A beer stop
was found under the overpass, and here the pack and very latecumer Cheap
Licker soon joined EB, Yaaker, Dr.Quim, and Ooozing imbibing the precious
liquid.

<P>The hares warned of the soon fading light and suggested quick bottoms
up.&nbsp; We were back on trail (?), through mild thickets and swampy ground.&nbsp;
Cheap Licker thought she would take the easy route across the parking lot…Oops!&nbsp;
That wasn’t tar, it was slush, and she was soon up to her crotch…Who said
that?&nbsp; I’ll have some of that.

<P>Pulled from the primordial ooze, she and the small band of idiots ran
along looking for little flour and even less surveyor’s tape placed close
to the trunk on trees so we couldn’t see it…smart!

<P>We blindly made our way across a ravine, down a gorge, and into a stream,
where we finally found flour and continued on trail.&nbsp; We came upon
a large culvert.&nbsp; Couldn’t go around it, Couldn’t go under it.&nbsp;
So we went ‘through, it through it, through it”.&nbsp; We pooped out the
second culvert and wound up on the bank of a reservoir.&nbsp; Beer was
soon found, and a very rested Bondo Jovi, Tinker (bell), RIPTA, and Bush
Yaaker.&nbsp; They had driven there, and had already imbibed a couple by
the time we showed up at Beer Stop #2 complete with Bondo Brew.

<P>By now the sun was well below the horizon, and what little light we
had would not penetrate the woods we soon entered following this beer break.&nbsp;
The 4 idiots: Basket, Oozing, Cheap and Dr.Quim ran along what seemed like
a path or clearing to bush and brambles.&nbsp; Deeper we traveled, like
rats in a maze bumping into things in the night we shouldn’t have been
near.&nbsp; Eventually we decided the biggest idiot was Basket, who thought
he remembered the area from years ago, and led the Lemmings along their
sorry trek.

<P>All arrived back on the road well scraped and bruised, and ran along
Rte 114 back to the start. We checked Cheap’s map and found the Hare’s
house was the first street we passed after exiting the woods.&nbsp; With
little effort or time we hopped into our cars and drove to the OnOn.

<P>A circle was formed and many excuses were told of why we did what we
did and to whom, but the hares that led us into the deep dark forest with
no lights offered little respite.&nbsp; RIPTA did ask if anyone had a flashlight
at the start, but even after we replied in the negative, she let us go
anyway.&nbsp; As Sweet Adorable, she could have said, “Since you don’t
have lights, and it is very dark, and you might lose an eye or your life
in the woods, why don’t you just run along the road to my house.”&nbsp;
Instead she let us run into the “Slaughter at Portsmouth”.&nbsp; Cheap
lost her earring, Ooozing lost his nerve, Dr. Quim lost his innocence and
I lost my respect for all the other hashers that rode with Bondo to the
OnOn, and all of us lost much flesh to the briars and branches that waited
like scorpions in a sleeping bag.
<BR>At the circle some non-running fucks showed up.&nbsp; These included
Nippy, Double Flush, Six Places To Put It Bob Hope, and Barbie.&nbsp; Down
Downs were justly administered and we went inside for the best food we’ve
had all week. Since we are evidently really stupid people, we all agreed
it was a good hash and we all had a good time.&nbsp; Maybe some day we’ll
grow up and not do stupid things………….Naaahhhhh!
<BR>Thanks EBRIPTA and Yaaker.&nbsp; Real shitty trail.
