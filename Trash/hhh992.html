<p><font color="#008000">Run #992</font>, April 11, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Bondo Jovi</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Parente’s, Smithfield</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Mid-40’s, clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Dr WHO, Fuwangi Boner, Basket Boom Boom, Dry Foot Fairy, 
Oozing SD, SESYB, WIPOS, Seamus, Ben.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>
<p>This was the first all-daylight hash of 2005. It was Live-hared. By <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi.</font> 
From an area with no virgin territory whatsoever (except I believe trail has never before gone just north of the 
third white pine in the grove east of the junior varsity field hockey field at Bryant although it has gone just 
south of this same tree on Run #826 if I’m not mistaken). And the hare was still recovering from the forcible 
removal of several large cylindrical foreign bodies from his nether person the week before. A sure recipe for 
disaster.</p>

<p>But the hare was off (at <font color="#FF0000">Async’s</font> arrival at 6 PM) for a 30 minute head start. By 
the time <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> arrived, 15 minutes later, the hare could be seen struggling through 
the underbrush, 30 yards away from the parking lot. He was making unusually good time! The rest arrived individually 
before the usual deadline (except for <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, smart enough to delay the agony and 
hopefully pick up on some short-cuts). At 6:30 they entered the sewage overflow swamp heading south. How 
appropriate!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>observed the terrain. Frightened of the thought of getting his feet dirty, 
he decided that he knew the workings of the hare’s mind (now THAT’S a scary thought!) and decided to branch off 
northwest towards Bryant. The rest remained on trail, southward alongside and in-and-out of a stream. The marks 
were sporadic, there were no paths to speak of, and there was plenty of shiggy. Every one was pricked.  
Substantially. It was a happy moment. The last such moment of the run. Two or three meaningless checks were 
dispatched. The hare, doubtless panicky and looking over his shoulder at every noise, had set no false marks. Led 
by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, the group came together to what appeared to be the last mark, adjacent to 
two near-impenetrable rows of briars close to the junction of Rt 116 and the powerlines.</p>

<p>The group split up in search of a mark.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried the powerline north briefly. 
He then gave up, assuming the hare could not have set that short a run. (This should have been a clue.) <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> turned southwest on 116, then northwest on Mowry. He then gave up (fortunately for him, 
as he just missed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, making his way over from Bryant.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot Fairy</font> joined <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> searching for <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, figuring 
he had been gone long enough that he must have found trail. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> tried the woods due west for a while.  <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> picked the 
briars out of her legs, and set about collecting wood ticks to give to the hare at the Beer Check.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> had by now arrived, and was adjusting his armor, trying to hear whistles or horns.</p>

<p>Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>picked up the flour on the powerline heading north (just beyond 
a steaming pool of fresh urine. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could have left that there? How appropriate!) 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> followed as the trail brought them back 
to Rt 7, and crossing, continued into the woods to the west of the powerlines. <font color="#FF0000">
Async, Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> decided that the Beer Check must be under the 116 
bridge. They followed 116 southwest and convened at that site. No Marks. Rather than admit defeat, they turned onto 
the dirt bike paths, and enjoyed a muddy sojourn through the woods north back to Bryant. Still no marks. But some 
nice briars were encountered as they briefly bushwhacked onto the Bryant campus.</p>

<p>The lead pack had by now run a short but worthless loop through the woods (and the stream) north of the fields 
of the Smithfield “Town Farm and Asylum”. How appropriate! They returned south to find the beer check under a bridge 
on Essex Street, crossing the small stream. The hare waited with beer. Intermittent efforts were made with horn and 
whistle to attract the missing group. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, using sono-location devices built into his 
hash gear, heard the noise and turned towards the sound. He crossed Rt 7 just in time to be seen by <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> and the rest, emerging from the woods behind Parente’s. They followed the bulky yet 
swiftly moving figure across the Asylum grounds.</p>

<p>Just about to leave, the hare and the others cursed mightily at the new arrivals. But there was still beer. There 
was still light.  There were still seven or eight unsung rhubarb verses. So the Beer Check was extended. Ticks were 
presented, and scratches admired. But the beer supply had been seriously depleted by the early arrivals, so they 
quickly ran out. They soon headed back, without benefit of marks, across the Asylum to Parente’s.</p>

<p>The circle was formed behind the sewage treatment shed. How appropriate! The hare entered the circle. Ratings 
for the run: some shiggy with the first ticks of spring, live hare, incompetent marks, loss of 5 hashers were 
powerful marks in favor. But as all made it to BC, the weather was clear, and there were no injuries, the total came 
to a weak +0.69. Hashit was given again to <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, due to intense jealousy regarding his 
superior hashing skills, no doubt.</p>

<p>Despite efforts to move the On On On to Swampy’s, they next moved into Parente’s. A large family reunion was 
taking place at a neighboring table. The presence of young children curbed the language (a bit!) of the crew and 
limited the singing (a bit!) But an outlet for pre-senile exuberance must be allowed, so the group made up for lost 
time with beer theft, sabotage and general childish behavior. How appropriate! A fine example for the impressionable 
youths, indeed! But the choice of Parente’s as a site for a family outing is pretty questionable. Kind of like having 
your youth bible study group meet at Cady’s. So unfazed, the hash partied on, until it was time to “Heigh-Ho” out, 
departing at the same time as the kiddies, much to their parents distress. The evening was not, after all, a 
complete waste.</p>
