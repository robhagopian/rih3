<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>This just in...<BR>The Academy of Hash Awards has just announced their list of 
Greatest Hashes.<BR>It may cum to no surprise that one of our own has received 
this prestigious<BR>recognition of his hard work, intelligence and generosity.  
It isn't just a<BR>coincidence that this award is delivered on Chinese Lunar 
Year of the Hare.<BR>Basket Boom Boom is Hare of the Year and this past hash on 
March 1, 1999, he<BR>received Hash of the Year of his Year of the Hare Hash.  
<BR><BR>And now... &quot;The Year of the Hare Hash&quot;<BR>The hare (<font color="#FF0000">Basket
BoomBoom</font>) arrived wearing an expensive and eye catching<BR>hare outfit.  
Joining our award winning Basket were, in alphabetical order:<BR><font color="#FF0000">Async,
Bondo 
Jovi, Buster </font><font color="#000000">(GM)</font><font color="#FF0000">, Cheap Licker, Cinderella
</font><font color="#000000"> (Canadian Hasher)</font><font color="#FF0000">, Hurling<BR>Dick, 
Jake, Krisco Kid, Nippoleon, Oozing Syph, Shine On</font>, and <font color="#FF0000"> 
WIPOS</font><BR>(Hashit).<BR><BR>The Hare gave careful and complete directions to the 
pack that listened to<BR>his every word, and then he pointed the way to the 
start.  <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo, Jake</font>, and<BR><font color="#FF0000">Buster</font>
started well ahead of everyone else but 
were soon caught by the pack as they<BR>searched, in vain, for the elusive 
trail.  <font color="#FF0000">Krisco, Cheap</font>, and <font color="#FF0000"> Cinderella</font><BR>arrived at this time, and with their 
help, the pack found flour heading up<BR>the first of many cliffs.  Shiggy 
was found at the top, and as the rain had<BR>stopped just a few hours before the 
hash, there would be much more in the<BR>future for this lucky band of misfits. 
<BR><BR>The trail meandered over a sandpit, through an old landfill, and out 
into a<BR>heavy-forested area.  The trail seemed almost manicured, and the marks 
were<BR>so well laid, it was almost impossible to get lost...but some tried 
harder than<BR>others.  <font color="#FF0000"> Krisco</font> was found scratching his bare legs with briars,
<font color="#FF0000"> 
Cheap</font> was<BR>wondering through high scrub brush without a flashlight, and
<font color="#FF0000"> Async</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font><BR>were fighting for DFL (deaf fucking last place) off on a side 
trail.  As all<BR>trails make there way out to the street, this one did also, 
but for just a<BR>short time, as flour was discovered across the street in a 
newly built<BR>expensive development area.  We were soon back in the woods, this 
hash was<BR>like a finely tuned piano. Just the right mix of hills and valley, 
dry and<BR>wet lands, woods and street. Everyone was enjoying themselves, 
even <font color="#FF0000"> Shine On</font><BR>(she's a screamer, you know) who was so delighted with Baskets 
trail, she<BR>was soon moaning with ecstasy. <BR><BR>The pack found 
themselves climbing over many &quot;Glacier Nuggets&quot; and valley's<BR>before 
cuming out in the Highland Memorial Park.  It was a beautiful setting<BR>amid 
the now decomposed flesh, and manicured lawns. Hurling was heard saying<BR>that 
he wished the Newport Hash could lay trial this good. Then down again<BR>through 
another forest and out someone's back yard.  We were then on a<BR>combination of 
paved streets and off road trails until we found a check on<BR>Rte 44 in 
Centerdale, RI.  Bondo, always looking for the hardest and 
longest<BR>way, decided to take Buster along the Highway, as the rest of the 
pack weaved<BR>its way behind Wallgreen's, and onto an abandoned rail bed.  
A well placed check<BR>sent those with a greater intelligence across a swollen 
backwash of the<BR>Winaquatusket and on Beer.  Well, no so quickly, as they had 
to re-cross<BR>further upstream, and found beer finally on the rail bed.  
<BR><BR><font color="#FF0000">Async, Cheap, Cinderella</font>, and another mindless soul passed the 
&quot;B&quot; mark and<BR>continued on for several hundred feet before thinking 
that they may have<BR>gone to far.  Bass Ale was enjoyed by all, except <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
who was last seen dodging<BR>cars along Putnam Pike.  A few songs were enjoyed 
as the beer went down<BR>deliciously, and a warm breeze carried our voices out 
of the forest to an<BR>admiring crowd.<BR><BR>Some started out after finishing 
their beer, and following <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, lost trail<BR>and joined
<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> on the highway, 
while <font color="#FF0000"> Cheap </font> and <font color="#FF0000">Krisco</font>, with
<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> doing<BR>sweep, followed behind the factory, 
crossing not one, but 2 industrial<BR>walkways over the river, and out to a ball 
park.  Then it was back into the<BR>woods, along the river, and through a gate 
into the Smithfield Water and<BR>Septic Plant.  After going through two more 
holes in fences, we crossed a t<BR>foot deep feeder brook, along streets and up 
a sharp rock cliff before<BR>finding<BR>their way back to the 
cars.<BR><BR>Down-downs were given to the hare for a great run, to the 
visitor<BR><font color="#FF0000">Cinderella</font>, Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> for missing the Beer Stop, and a 
swing low brought the<BR>circle to a close.  We adjourned inside to more beer 
and food.  <font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> had<BR>decorated our private room with many hare decorations 
and candy, and<BR>needless to say, a good time was had by all.  It is no 
wonder this hare wins awards<BR>year after year.<BR>Congratulations <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>...well done, again! <BR>

Hullo all,<BR><BR>Further to Shine On's Lies!, Lies!!, and More Lies!!!<BR><BR>I 
now have the facts on &quot;The Year of the Hare&quot; &quot;run&quot; from 
Cinderella, and <BR>this is on very good authority as Canucks never lie. (At 
least I am so <BR>informed by Dribble Dick, and he never lies.) I 
quote:<BR><BR>&quot;Ran the 'Year of the Hare' hash with the RI HHH on Monday 
night. Basket <BR>was suffering from a severe case of dementia as a result of a 
wanking <BR>accident in which his hand flew off the handle and whacked a frontal 
<BR>lobe. Left side. He was under the delusion that he had laid an 
<BR>award-winning run, when actually he <BR>had just wandered aimlessly around 
in Smithfield, staggered into a cliff <BR>and up several large hills, and then 
fell several times into a dioxin <BR>riddled river.<BR><BR>&quot;Thank God, one 
of the hashers from Newport recognized the neighbourhood as<BR>his grandmother's 
so we were able to abandon the 'trail' for the last one <BR>third of the 'run'. 
Instead, we cruised the roads the way back to point <BR>A. About 6 of us got 
back about 15 minutes before the pack, so we had <BR>lots of beers in the bar to 
try to forget the first two-thirds of this <BR>horrible 'run'. When I got back 
home, I burned my RI Hash T-shirt.&quot; <BR><BR>There you have an unbiased 
eye-witless account of the (hah!) <BR>award-winning run. <BR><BR>Now, onto 
another of Basket's delusions. Cinderella continued: <BR>&quot;Unfortunately, 
Basket rounded us up for the down-downs. He asked me <BR>three questions during 
down-downs as my initiation as a visitor. The <BR>first one was who connected me 
with the RI Hash. When I told Basket you <BR>had landed the Laos work, he was 
pretty confident you hadn't. Basket <BR>asked when I last spoke to you. I 
indicated about 3 weeks earlier which <BR>still didn't seem to persuade him 
otherwise. Not sure why he was so <BR>adamant that you were coming back to 
stay.&quot;<BR><BR>I can tell you why. The only good hash is a hash where over 
50% of its <BR>members are unemployed, and in the case of the RI Hash, 
unemployable. OK, <BR>we have few black sheep like Async and Wipos. (Oozing just 
carries around <BR>a mobile phone.) We have a great hash in RI, and Basket tries 
to keep it <BR>that way (unemployed) by sending anonymous letters to employers, 
<BR>describing the hash employee's pedophile tendencies. Basket doesn't have 
<BR>a clue as to how I get paid (neither do I), so for the record, Laos is 
<BR>on. (Well, it's as certain as anything ever gets around here.) I expect 
<BR>to be deployed to Vientiane in June for two or three years. There is the 
<BR>Vientiane Saturday Hash, the Monday Bush Hash, and across the Mekong 
<BR>River is a new hash in Udorn. (You on, Necker?)<BR><BR>Thitiya and I will 
return to RI on 18 March, returning to Bangkok on 20 <BR>May. (Pliz put us on 
the hareline, Mist'r.) Hope Basket gets better, but <BR>a left-side injury is 
considered serious. Condolences to Dog Meat, <BR>although she's probably used to 
anything by this time.<BR><BR>Tinker &amp; Short-Shorts<BR>
