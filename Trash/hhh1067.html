<p><i>American Airlines Flight 11 was the first flight used in the September 11, 2001 attacks. It was an American Airlines 
flight aboard a Boeing 767-223ER aircraft, registration number N334AA. Flight 11 regularly flew from Logan International 
Airport in East Boston, Massachusetts, to Los Angeles International Airport. On September 11, 2001, the aircraft on this 
route was hijacked; the hijackers crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City.  On the fifth 
anniversary September 11, 2006, the hare wanted to commemorate and recreate this historic event on the 9/11 hash.</i></p>

<p>There are believed to have been five (hash)jackers:<br><br>

* <font color="#FF0000">Mohamed <b>Oozing</b> Atta al Sayed</font> (Egyptian) - the ringleader and pilot, was in seat 
69D.<br>
* <font color="#FF0000">Waleed <b>Bondo</b> al-Shehri</font> (Saudi Arabian) - sat in seat 69B<br>
* <font color="#FF0000">Wail <b>Basket</b> al-Shehri</font> (Saudi Arabian) - sat next to Waleed, in seat 69A<br>
* <font color="#FF0000">Abdulaziz <b>Amish</b> al-Omari</font> (Saudi Arabian) - had earlier flown with Atta to Logan 
Airport from Portland, Maine<br>
* <font color="#FF0000">Satam <b>Tinker</b> al-Suqami</font> (Saudi Arabian) - had paid in cash that day, sat in seat 
69F<br><br>

The innocent (hash)victims:<br><br>

* Flight attendants <font color="#FF0000">Madeline <b>Virgin Kana</b> Sweeney</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Betty 
<b>Great at Giving Head</b> Ong</font><br>
* A passenger, <font color="#FF0000">Daniel <b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font>, a notable Internet entrepreneur, had also 
previously served as an officer in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit of the Israeli military. A 2002 FAA memo referenced <font 
color="#FF0000"><b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font> as possibly being killed by <font color="#FF0000">Satam <b>Tinker</b> 
al-Suqami</font> after he attempted to stop the (hash)jacking.<br>
* <font color="#FF0000">John <b>WIPOS</b> Ogonowski</font> (Pilot, aka Hare) and <font color="#FF0000">Thomas F. <b>Eenie 
Weenie Dick</b> McGuinness Jr.</font> (First Officer and secret admirer of the Hare’s fashion sense, or lack thereof).<br>
* Seamus (sedated and stowed away in cargo) and Ben (who managed to escape cargo, whine and run impatiently up and down 
the isles to further annoy <font color="#FF0000">Mohamed <b>Oozing</b> Atta al Sayed</font>, thus ensuring that he would 
in fact kill himself and put everyone else out of their own misery, for no other good reason than to escape Ben – there IS 
an Allah after all… I digress).<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>With everyone secure in their respective roles, they gathered at a dirt parking lot on the south side of Beach Pond.  
Many oogled over <font color="#FF0000">Madeline <b>Virgin Kana</b> Sweeney</font>, after a summer of the All Man’s 
Hash.  Despite that minor (major) distraction, trail initially headed south east after the last minute arrival of the 
pilot (hare) <font color="#FF0000">John <b>WIPOS</b> Ogonowski</font> to point the way.  He should have bailed then and 
there, but it’s all history now.  Just as Flight 11 headed in its prescribed flight path, it wasn’t long before <font 
color="#FF0000">Mohamed <b>Oozing</b> Atta al Sayed</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Waleed <b>Bondo</b> al-Shehri</font> 
hijacked the hash, forcing the pack southward.  <font color="#FF0000">Wail <b>Basket</b> al-Shehri</font> initially 
objected, complaining that the 77 virgins (and beer) awaiting each of them were in fact north.  Typically, <font 
color="#FF0000">Wail <b>Basket</b> al-Shehri</font> was wrong, in this case, especially about the 77 virgins.</p>

<p>Being a first time flight attendant and hasher, <font color="#FF0000">Madeline <b>Virgin Kana</b> Sweeney</font> was 
confused and discombobulated.  <font color="#FF0000">Betty <b>Great at Giving Head</b> Ong</font> tried to comfort her, 
yet was equally confused and discombobulated.  First officer <font color="#FF0000">Thomas F. <b>Eenie Weenie Dick</b> 
McGuinness Jr.</font> is always confused and discombobulated, thus providing no assistance what-so-ever.  Pathetic!</p>

<p>Trail soon ran into rocks and a check (somewhere over West Virginia), which distracted <font color="#FF0000">Daniel 
<b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Wail <b>Basket</b> al-Shehri</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">
Abdulaziz <b>Amish</b> al-Omari</font> headed north to no avail.  <font color="#FF0000">Betty <b>Great at Giving Head</b> 
Ong</font> went south to no avail.  <font color="#FF0000">Thomas F. <b>Eenie Weenie Dick</b> McGuinness Jr.</font> went 
westward to no avail.  <font color="#FF0000">Satam <b>Tinker</b> al-Suqami</font> stood at the check and waited to no 
avail.  <font color="#FF0000">Waleed <b>Bondo</b> al-Shehri</font> stood atop the rocks, bringing the pack to him, but to 
no avail.  The hare was nowhere to be seen, to no avail.  This write-up has been making no sense, to no avail. I digress,
 to no avail.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Mohamed <b>Oozing</b> Atta al Sayed</font> finally found true trail heading southward through 
some contrived Shenandoah shiggy.  They all wallowed together for a while until they reconnected with a well-traveled 
path turning northward (unsuspectingly toward New York).  Reaching a check, all were fooled except for <font 
color="#FF0000">Wail <b>Basket</b> al-Shehri</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Daniel <b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font> who went 
straight, missing the pathetic token shiggy.  With <font color="#FF0000">Wail <b>Basket</b> al-Shehri</font> chasing him 
down with a box cutter in his hand, <font color="#FF0000">Daniel <b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font> outran the entire pack, 
reaching Rt. 165 and crossing it.  He soon came to a “BN” at about the proximity of the Twin Towers, but blew right past 
it.  Something about <font color="#FF0000">Wail <b>Basket</b> al-Shehri</font> on his tail made him run like Forest Gump 
(and it wasn’t the box cutter).</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Wail <b>Basket</b> al-Shehri</font> was the first to reach and STOP at the beer check, but he 
could not locate the beer.  It took the fearless leader <font color="#FF0000">Mohamed <b>Oozing</b> Atta al Sayed</font> 
to set out a proper search party.  Nevertheless, only <font color="#FF0000">John <b>WIPOS</b> Ogonowski</font> could find 
the beer.  Strangely, he showed up with <font color="#FF0000">Satam <b>Tinker</b> al-Suqami</font> as though they were 
best friends and proving to the world that we can all actually “get along”.  I digress, again, to no avail.</p>

<p>Beer was enjoyed by all except for <font color="#FF0000">Daniel <b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font> who was not missed.  And 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was also not missed.  The fact that <font color="#FF0000">Daniel <b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin
</font> had Ben with him made the hashers unusually quiet when they typically would call fellow hashers to the BC.  Upon 
departing the BC, the pack soon reached the parched and weakened <font color="#FF0000">Daniel <b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font> 
heading toward them.  Only <font color="#FF0000">Abdulaziz <b>Amish</b> al-Omari</font> took solace for the quenched 
(Oriental) Jew and offered him the rest of his beer.  If only the UN were there to witness this, the solution for Middle 
East peace might actually be found -- it’s called BEER!  DUH!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the pack ran back to Beach Pond to the start which was in the vicinity of Boston Logan Airport.  
Following <font color="#FF0000">John <b>WIPOS</b> Ogonowski</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Satam <b>Tinker</b> 
al-Suqami</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Daniel <b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font> took an alternate route along 165 back to 
the start.  After some confusion, the circle occurred somewhere in Boston Harbor (South Beach Pond).  Ratings were weak 
for originality, but strong for virginity, a virgin bimbo no less(!), no <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, and a lost 
<font color="#FF0000">Daniel <b>Dry Foot</b> Lewin</font>.  Total: <b>+6.9</b>!  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">
Betty <b>Great at Giving Head</b> Ong</font> for his continued attempts to ruin the all too successful All Man’s Hash.</p>

<p>On-after was at the Big River Inn where the cute blonde didn’t take any solace on any of us 9/11 re-enactors (it must 
have been <font color="#FF0000">Mohamed <b>Oozing</b> Atta al Sayed</font>).  In fact, what should have been a historic 
moment commemorating the 5th anniversary of 9/11, turned out to be yet another pathetic waste of a Monday evening.</p>
