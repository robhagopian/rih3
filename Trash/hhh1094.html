<p><font color="#008000">Run #1094</font>, March 19, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Cumberland, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 30s, snowy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish, Oozing, Dr. WHO, Seamus</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>After a fun-filled weekend including trips on Saturday to Newport for the St Patty’s day parade (which was amazing – 
half nekkid bimbos, beer flowing like water from every porch, explosions, bands, floats – right <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>?) and on Sunday to Boston for the Ras na hEireann r*n and following parade and partying <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could have imagined that a hash would be set the following Monday?  Actually, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> couldn’t and neither could <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>, but they showed up anyway in attempts to drink just a few beers to allow their livers to wean off the alcohol 
instead of stopping cold turkey.  Directions had us meet at St Patrick’s church in Cumberland, and as 6:00 rolled around 
so did the snow storm with the less than 1in prediction from the weathermen soon to be proven false.</p>

<p>Trail led northwest out of the parking lot with the first check located at Broad and Church.  <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> went right, towards the train tracks and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> soon followed.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, putting forth as much effort as a losing Pakistani cricket team, decided to walk with the 
hare, down Broad, and take a left onto John.  A quick “on on” had <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turning back to join the rest.  Check number two was encountered at the merger of John and 
Chambers where trail was determined to head under the bridge.  By this time the snow had been falling steadily for a half 
hour and the marks were becoming increasingly hard to see.</p>

<p>A check below the bridge had us heading north along the side of the swollen………….river………..and through the new powder 
snow.  Another check was encountered, but with choices of uphill to nowhere or continuation on trail the decision was 
easy.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> lead the way with <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> close behind, once again 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, putting forth as much effort as a losing Pakistani cricket team, decided to walk with 
the hare.</p>

<p>As the trail and river made a turn west a tunnel was found, and thought to be the whiskey check, but the hare pushed 
the group ahead, up and out across the train tracks into the Ann and Hope parking lot.  With the snow coming down heavily, 
the hare re-laid an arrow leading the pack northwest along the tracks to Ann and Hope Way.  A check was found, <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> went straight and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> went left.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>, once again putting forth as much effort as a losing Pakistani cricket team, had fallen behind but close enough to 
see the pack.  True trail was determined to head across Mendon Rd and behind the Stop and Shop parking lot with a quick 
jaunt through some “shiggy” onto the bike path.  With marks now almost non existent due to the snow, the hare recommended 
that paw prints be followed.  Bending over to uncover marks, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> made their way up the bike path and to the bridge overlooking the Blackstone River for the whiskey check.</p>

<p>As <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> waited, 
the roar of the Blackstone could be heard below.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> finally showed up, and after a few 
passes of the flask in the snow our break quickly ended.  A check at the bridge had us hopping over a chain-link fence and 
into private waste dumping land, which seemed fitting based on the smells emanating from the assholes of the group one day 
earlier.  A veer to the left along the river and a few marks later had everyone on the train tracks, where once again it 
was advised that dog paw prints be used as trail markings.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> went out front with <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> right behind, and they continued along the freshly 
powdered tracks into the dark.</p>

<p>Bending over to uncover marks, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> swapped places 
now and again until a final check was found at the intersection of a path leading west into the woods.  With <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> calling from behind “do you see the light,” <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> pushed on 
until yes – he did see the light.  The light of a fire left behind by someone other than <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>.  Disappointed at the lack of use of a great beer check location, the three continued on left, farther into the 
woods and away from the tracks.  Once again, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, putting forth as much effort as a losing 
Pakistani cricket team, trailed far behind.  Coming up on the backside of a large building, <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> knew the beer was near.  As we entered a parking lot <font color="#FF0000">
Basket’s</font> Jeep could be seen, and soon enough we were enjoying a mix of Trinity Stout and IPA.  Eventually <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> showed up and the three sang a few songs before piling into the car for the ride back to St 
Patrick’s.  With the snow still continuing heavily, it was decided we’d get to the on on on before the circle was held.
</p>

<p>Due to our more recent trips to The Lodge, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> pushed for eating at Tuck’s, a decision 
we’d all later regret.  Arriving in the lot, we all headed to the rear corner where the circle was held.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> bitched about <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> taking over for <font color="#FF0000">
Hoover</font> and bitched about <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> using sections that reminded him of <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi’s</font> hash and….well, bitched about anything he could think of.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font> couldn’t have been happier about the fresh snow and gave the run glowing remarks.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
talked about how his hash the following week would remedy the recent lack of marks and how it’d be hash of the year.  
Mathematical total: <b>-6.9</b>!  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> ended up with the hashit due to complete lack of 
effort, similar to the losing Pakistani cricket team.  After things were wrapped up everyone headed into Tuck’s.</p>

<p>The free soup was good and upon questioning the waitress stated it was “turkey and something.”  We all agreed the 
“something” made it taste the best.  Upon reading the specials Basket went for the corner beef on rye, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> the corner beef pot pie.  Once the food arrived, both learned the valuable lesson of never 
ordering meat products that were most likely leftovers from the previous weekend.  The pot pie was almost identical to the 
soup, minus the addition of two rock-hard biscuits on top.  And the corned beef sandwich could have been easily mistaken 
for beef jerky.  All in all it was pretty darned bad, but at least Seamus would get something out of it.</p>

<p>And just as they showed up amongst the falling snow, they left amongst the falling snow, hoping it’d be the last blast 
of winter.</p>
