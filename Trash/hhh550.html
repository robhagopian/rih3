<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The venue was off 146A at the Christmas tree shop,
attendees were Basket (our Hare for the evening) Hopeless, Bondo with Jake
and an old runner who had previously run with the Hash sometime ago known
as the Plume, who is a scribe with a Providence newspaper and yours truly.
The attendees dressed in Christmas attire and we were each judged by our
peers, Hopeless making a bold effort with false nose and glasses obviously
not wishing to be recognized looked like something out of the three stooges.
Basket had a Santa hat on and looked no different to normal, Bondo and
Jake came as themselves and our new runner knew nothing about our competition.
The star of the show in my opinion was yours truly who had made a bold
effort coming dressed as a parcel, being a very gifted scribe their was
nothing better to run in. Photographs were taken by Basket, to which we
all wondered if their was any film in this camera he brings every week
and would we ever see any snaps. Even the German sort would be nice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">At 6.40pm, the pack set off on road before entering
woods, marks were difficult to see this evening but your scribe by luck
found himself at the front on more than a few occasions taking the FRB
title before being overtaken by our human gazelle Hopeless, small amounts
of shiggy brambles and a few cunning checks before we got to the beer check
which this week was warm cider, which everybody thought was piss left by
some thieves who had taken the real stuff, one cup and only one cup was
had by all, Basket trying hard to offer top ups but everybody saying they
could not drink any more, the most true statement on any Hash, even Jake
farted when offered more, that really summed it up. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On off every body desperate for a drink, fortunately
we were not disappointed as after some more tricky checks, the trick being
they were not marked, we arrived at a monument under some rock which turned
out to be an unusual place for a beer stop never the less a very welcome
place to drink real beer. Even Jake lapped up any leftovers, we set off
again after singing a few melodies to be taken through some of the best
shiggy (or worst, I guess it depends on how tall you are) this year. Depending
which route you took decided how wet you got Basket was in up to his armpits
but as he is a shortars it was not a true measure Hopeless told us he got
his dick wet but the water was only up to his knees, bragging as always.
Nobody got through without getting thoroughly soaked even our illustrious
GM had trouble picking his way through with the temperature being a warm
35 degrees Fahrenheit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A circle up with the normal ceremonies followed
with our new/old runner Plume giving us a song. We then all headed back
to Baskets pad for another round of good grub and grog, we were all relieved
not to see any more cider. Song books and Christmas song sheets were issued
as a momento of our 550th run to which every body participated, it must
be commented that this was one of our better vocal evenings which everyone
enjoyed. The prize for the best costume went to Bondo, which was a modern
TV with the screensaver being a picture of the ensemble of the RIH3, the
sound left a little bit to be desired but I just didn’t realize how far
you Americans were behind the Japanese! The set did not even have a remote,
but it was cordless. Good time had by all.</FONT></P>
