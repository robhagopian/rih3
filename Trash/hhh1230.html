color=#000000>A large crowd turned up at the Memorial Park in Attleboro at the 
east end of Tiffany Road. As they arrived, the daylight waned rapidly. Perhaps 
it was this, or perhaps it was the sight of suspicious old men arriving in 
strange running clothes; but either way,&nbsp;the pre-teen soccer match closed 
up shop rapidly, and the soccer moms kept their little ones close as they got to 
their cars and drove off. The hare started them off, on time yet 
again.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"

the upper playing fields. They encountered a check. And another check. And 
another, and another, and another… It turned out that some groundskeeper had 
been marking the field with chalk circles randomly for some unknown reason. The 
hash almost ended before it began. Finally, the hare was seen back near the 
cars, convulsing with laughter. He directed them (with some re-marking) 
northeast, along the tracks.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

lending a fine aroma to this new&nbsp;beginning. A check led across South Main 
Street, and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> found trail in some shiggy. This led 
briefly back to the tracks and turned west. The group came to the Ten Mile 
River. There were many choices here. Marks indicated that the river should be 
crossed. <FONT color=#ff0000>CEP</FONT> found that it was too deep for his 
taste. Most then paralleled the river northeast until they came to a bridge. 
Crossing over, marks were found.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

Swinging south, those that stuck with the hare were rewarded, as he led them to

<FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi </FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>CEP</FONT> blew past

Finishing up, some tried to follow trail, but most simply made their way down 
into the gravel pit, and took the road out to Tiffany, and turned left to the 
cars.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

some good shiggy, over 50 checks in the first 200 yards. WOW, MOM. But, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> making it to 
the beer check by backtracking, only one bimbo, and no one actually crossing the 
river (not even the hare!) Total: +0. A naming was called for. <FONT

<FONT color=#ff0000>Hairy Krishna</FONT>. Hashit went to <FONT

Finishing up, the hare went to some local rib place with the young folk, 
the<FONT color=#ff0000> Auld Pharts</FONT> went to the more usual Wetherlaines, 
and I believe <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> went to Ocean 
Mist.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
