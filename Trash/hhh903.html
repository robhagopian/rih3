<p><font size="5" color="#800080">Rage Against the Machine Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Run #903</font>, August 6, 2003</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Raging QOB</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Scribe:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Async</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Wrentham, MA</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Warm, 100% humidity, swarms of deer flies</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Async, Bondo, Dr WHO, SESYB, WIPOS, Birdbrain,&nbsp; Basket 
Boom Boom, Oozing, Fuwangi Boner, Swallows My Pride, Shine On, Seamus, Just Josh, Just Ted</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Hare <font color="#FF0000">Raging</font> was clearly looking for redemption on this Hash.&nbsp;&nbsp; He served nuthin' 
but copious quantities of Guiness Stout for the pre-run lubrication, beer check, and circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> was suspicious.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could this lowlife transplant from Connecticut have somehow filled 
said Guiness bottles with Miller Lite?&nbsp; Nope, it smelled like Guinness, tasted like Guinness.&nbsp; Hell, even Seamus 
enjoyed the brew!</p>

<p>We had expected a large crowd from the Boston Hash, given all the whining about directions in the days leading up to 
the Hash.&nbsp; Unfortunately, only <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> and one of her many boyfriends from BH3 (<font 
color="#FF0000">Just Ted</font>) showed up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the Brahmin yuppies had advance word that no lite beer 
would be served.&nbsp;&nbsp; But <font color="#FF0000">Shine On's</font> many RI boyfriends welcomed her anyway.&nbsp;
&nbsp; It's been months since Ms. Moon has shattered car windows with her signature high-pitched squeal &quot;ARRRE 
YOUUUUU?&quot;</p>

<p>After a hurried explanation of <font color="#FF0000">Raging</font> hash marks, the pack took off up towards the AT&amp;
T microwave tower.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trail looped over and down into the gully behind the tower and into the woods.&nbsp;
&nbsp; At this point your scribe is unable to describe the trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> made 
the fatal mistake of trying to use more than half a brain and boogied directly over to Wolf Rocks...No beer check.&nbsp; 
A quick jaunt down to the waterfall.... No water and no beer check.&nbsp;&nbsp; A dash up the motorbike trail to the trail 
shelter.....no beer check.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back up to the start, back down the on-in road, back again....no beer 
check.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, wait a minute!&nbsp;&nbsp; What's that?&nbsp;&nbsp; Hare <font color="#FF0000">Raging</font> had 
thoughtfully left a cooler filled with Guiness in the back of his pick-up truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo!&nbsp;&nbsp; Time to 
chill out and swat a few deer flies.</p>

<p>The second and third wankers to wander back to the start were <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. They grabbed a Guinness or two and joined Async in swatting&nbsp; flies in the dusk of the 
parking lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of the pack began to stagger in....with varying tales of beer checks, shiggy and lost 
Pakistanis.&nbsp;&nbsp; We circled up in spite of missing a few wayward hashers.&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing a long 
circle,&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Swallows, Just Ted</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain</font> arrived back at 
the dark start in some sort of high-jacked SUV (actually driven by Just Ted's son).</p>

<p>We broke tradition and re-activated the sacred ritual of the Hash Circle to punish the auto-hashers and backsliders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> administered the new boot initiation ceremony for <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Ted</font>.</p>

<p>Ratings for the run were on the high side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Raging</font> received high marks, in 
no particular order,&nbsp; for copious shiggy, quality bimbos, decent beer for a change, and losing <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.</p>

<p>In a familiar ritual for this hare, the on-on restaurant kitchen closed early, so the pack took off for Chieftan's or 
BoxSeats or Bondo's garage, or parts unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, once again, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> failed to 
fulfill his scribe duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back at the start, he lost his&nbsp; &quot;Club&quot; key.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; You know the &quot;Club&quot;.&nbsp; It's that silly thing one attaches to a steering wheel to slow down the little 
pricks who might try to steal the car.&nbsp;&nbsp; There he was....in the woods, no club key, no flashlight, just the 
interior light of the car and a cellphone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier in the evening, <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> had lectured to others about the value of a &quot;hide-a-key!&quot;</p>

<p>A call of desperation to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a moment of weakness and compassion for a 
fellow hasher, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> did a U-turn on Route 1 and headed back to the start to help <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes later, the key was found; another call to <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>, &quot;Thanks, anyway!&quot;.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> took off after the pack in search of an on-on; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
followed shortly thereafter, but couldn't find the on-on.&nbsp; Oh well.</p>

<p><font color="#800000">Moral of the story:</font>&nbsp; Keep your club in your pants, your keys in your pocket, and your 
Guinness in your pick-up.&nbsp; Or something like that..</p>
