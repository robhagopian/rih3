<p>A brilliant preset then reset run in the dark and stormy night, traversing no less than four separate nature preserves, 
(each prominently displaying signs prohibiting entry after dark). Trail began east up into Weetamoo, curving south then 
west into Pardon Gray Preserve, where <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>discovered the joys of cow manure in an open 
field in the dark. Trail crossed back north to Seapowet Road, a loop by the co-hare's house missed by all, thence into the 
Emily Ruecker Refuge on the red trail, curving to the blue trail where the secret co-hare flashed all who made it that far. 
Then trail led to a salt marsh where the highest tide of the year and the 48 hours of torrential rain wiped out every hint 
of flour or toilet paper. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> led, demonstrating the art of finding all the deep parts of 
the marsh.&nbsp; True trail was taken up faithfully by the secret co-hare through the muck to Jack's Island Preserve, 
wading through the marsh, then the knee-deep water of the pebbled beach. On the island,&nbsp;&nbsp;the beer check was 
marked by a Jack-o-Lantern flashlight and giggling hare and co-hare (giggling because they didn't have to wade through a 
third of a mile of salt marsh to get there). Late to beercheck:<font color="#FF0000"> Oozing, Bondo, RIPTA</font>. Missed 
Beercheck: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. On In straight east on Seapowet and Lafayette Road. <br><br>
