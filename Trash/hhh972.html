<p><font color="#008000">Run #972,</font> Nov 22, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Tinker</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; RI Veterans Cemetery, Exeter</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 30’s, Partly Cloudy</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner, Dry Foot Fairy, Dr W.H.O., WIPOS, Basket Boom Boom, 
Oozing SD, SESYB, Just Michael (second RIH3 hash), Just Amy (1<sup>st</sup> RIH3 Hash, had briefly hashed in San 
Diego, and went to NERD 2004 in Newport), Seamus.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The group met next to the “Committal” Chapel at the western end off the RI Veterans Cemetery as per the hare’s 
instructions. Committal? Hashes to hashes and dust to dust? Never mind. The temperature was dropping. The moon was 
rising. No police were present. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was not present. Could there be a connection?</p>

<p>After instructions, they started the trail near a phallic obelisk, and went off into the woods on a rough path, 
going west. Almost immediately, they came to a road. <font color="#FF0000">Basket, SESYB</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> guessed left; <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
and the <font color="#FF0000">Fairy</font> guessed right (wrong). True trail led southwest on the road. A second check 
led past a gate into the Nature Conservancy Land, and a west leading dirt road. The gap between the FRBs and the 
pack widened.</p>

<p>The westward track had a few annoying side checks: one left into a field had the <font color="#FF0000">Fairy</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> falling further behind; a historical cemetery check to the right allowed them to 
catch up. Overall, it was fairly dull: no shiggy, no “<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>” checks, and no lost hashers. 
But it did allow the late newcomers to catch up. A check near the bridge over the Queen’s River dispersed the group, 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> thrashing about on the west bank, 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fairy</font> wandering in the brush to the sides of the 
check. All ended up wandering in circles through some pine barrens north of the trail until Basket blundered back and 
found true trail heading south along the river. The rest caught up soon, and they emerged into some fallow fields.</p>

<p>Trail led across the fields, along the border of the fields and generally in a clockwise half-circle looping back 
to the trail, and crossing, onto a path with a “B”. Found first by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, they quickly called out false trail, sending <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and the 
rest further south on the path. But even <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> cannot be fooled forever. The lights from 
the pair frantically searching for the beer, plus the charity of the hare drew everyone back, and shortly, they 
were enjoying chips, and looking askance at the hare’s beer choices (Sam Adams Winter Ale?!!) There was nothing for 
it but to sing. A prolonged version of the “Rhubarb Medley” was begun in multiple keys, in an attempt to ensure that 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Amy</font> would never return.</p>

<p>All bad things must come to an end. So with the hare muttering incomprehensible instructions about Turkey/Eagle 
splits, they moved on, west towards the river. An unusual arrow indicating a straight direction followed by a 
southward turn was found at the riverbank. Showing <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> no <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot Fairy</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> made the crossing, followed 
by <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> himself, anxious no doubt, for a renaming. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> (AKA <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Enema Bill</font>) led the rest through the brush on the east bank. 
The three on the west bank had the only fun on this pathetic hash, thrashing through some fine briars, crossing 
stream branches and swampy ground, before they gave up, and recrossed to try and find true trail.</p>

<p>But there was no true trail. The lead pack came out onto Mail Road and they crossed the bridge, running past the 
hare’s truck unawares. Only <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, bringing up the rear caught on, and found himself a 
warm berth in the cab of the truck. Basket and Fuwangi led the foolish hashers and newcomers north on Liberty Church 
Road, into a neighborhood. The wet-footed DFL-ers finally caught up, and climbed into the truck bed, where they opened 
some beer, and tried to finish off the chips. They tried to get the hare to abandon the rest. But the hare was too 
weak, and drove to the intersection, and honked. Led by <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Just Michael </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Just Amy</font> made it into the back. Now, the hare was more than 
willing to make a break for it. He almost made it away. But <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> caught up when the engine stalled. Loading in these two and Seamus, all were accounted 
for. The songs started up again as they drove back, keeping their minds off the hare’s driving skills. They got to 
the cars, and convoyed back to Wickford to the hare’s house for the circle.</p>

<p>In the circle, some more questionable beer choices were broached and the ceremonies began. Ratings for the run: 
little shiggy, considerable pavement, no police, strange beer and good weather guaranteed a poor overall rating. But 
with <font color="#FF0000">Short-Shorts</font> cooking their meal and anxiously watching through the kitchen window 
the total miraculously improved to: +6.9! Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, for no goddam reason 
whatsoever, that your scribe can recall! After a few songs, it was into the warmth of the hare’s house for an 
excellent meal, and an attempt at breaking the record for the performance of the largest number of offensive songs 
in a 4 hour period in history. Too bad the Guinness Book of Records (or beer, for that matter) wasn’t there. But you 
can bet that Just Amy won’t reappear any time soon, so at least that much was accomplished.</p>
