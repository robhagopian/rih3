<p><font color="#008000">Run #1131</font>, December 3, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; WWI Memorial Park, North Attleboro</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 20’s, Icy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Dr WHO, Concrete Feet, Amish It Head, Basket Boom Boom, Scatwoman, 
Just Sean.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>It was a fine night for a hash. Brisk and clear, with lots of ice covering a small amount of snow. But then again, 
remembering that <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was hare, the cold chill you get is not from the ambient 
temperature. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> made one of his rare appearances, obviously desperate. <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Sean</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Scatwoman</font> showed up, but they don’t know <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. The rest had no excuse. Even <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> knows enough to stay away 
with this hare. But at 6:30 they were off.</p>

<p>Trail led straight out from the end of George Leven Drive continuing southwest. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led 
as they hit the first check, and turned right. Three marks and bushwhacking, he called the rest on. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> continued straight, but the rest remembered the following <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> rule and turned north. This of course, led to a prolonged circle jerk into Plainville, 
and recurving clockwise back to the cars. Trying again, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> led the chagrined pack back 
out to the check and out to some powerlines. True trail was found turning southeast.</p>

<p>The pack distance was widening, and the marks were few and mostly white or very slightly-tinted flour on white snow. 
A system sure to please! At least it’s better than little white paper squares stapled to trees. <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> plowed ahead, trying to catch up with the FRBs. Trail soon turned 
west on a smaller powerline and came out to a neighborhood.  A check led to a brief bushwhack at the end of a cul-de-sac 
off Blue Jay Drive. Some continued on the powerlines, the rest followed <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> (who was 
following the hare by this point). Trail led southwest crossing the powerlines, skirting a playing field and then 
turning up hill on an overgrown path.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for all concerned, this turn led to the discovery of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font>, all milling about aimlessly. The hare tried to 
be helpful. He said it was all bushwhacking at this point. He couldn’t find his own marks. But he suggested that 
whenever a hill was encountered, it should be climbed. Using this dubious advice, the group gradually came together, 
finding one or two random marks at the top of hillocks, heading generally northeast. They crossed the powerlines again 
and came out to Elmwood Street. Trail then led to the picnic/BBQ area of the WW I Memorial Park. Climbing the final 
hill, they came to the overlook next to the ski slopes. They found trail leading down and to a “B” under the 
overlook.</p>

<p>The beer was found and opened. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was sent to the overlook. He was too dry to make 
water on those below, and the beer was not to be moved to the more scenic spot. So they huddles together at the edge of 
the woods below the rock outcropping. The acoustics weren’t all that great either. Finally sick of this, the hare gave 
further instructions. He said there were no marks back. He suggested just following the ski lift path down and turn left 
on the powerlines. So down they went, slipping and grabbing at the J-bars as they went. At the powerlines, <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> turned right. The rest turned left. But one powerline pretty much looks like another, so 
it was only because Amish was paying attention that they found the check where they had previously entered. They turned 
left.</p>

<p>Back at the cars, the first in had a bit of a wait. <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> finished his tour of the 
powerlines and arrived. <font color="#FF0000">Just Sean</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Scatwoman</font> apparently 
enjoyed the circle jerk so much the first time that they decided to repeat. But finally all were there and they circled. 
The run was rated.  Virgin territory, a fine circle jerk, some bushwhacking through briars with a lost hare, and white 
flour on white snow were all favorable factors. But all made it to the BC and no one was permanently lost so the total: 
<b>+0.69</b>. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> for no reason other than he wasn’t paying adequate 
attention when his name came up.  The circle was closed. They drove off to LA Roberts, where they have crap beer, but 
the hare likes the clams, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> likes the liver and onions, and they seemed to have 
forgotten us from the last time. And between the darts and the Patriots game, the group was well-behaved enough that 
they can probably return the next time they’re in the neighborhood without risking immediate ejection.</p>
