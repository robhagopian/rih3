<font color="#3333FF">Present: </font> <font color="#FF0000">Dr W.H.O</font>.(Hare),
<font color="#FF0000">Async, Wipos, Bondo, Gaping Festering Hole, Just Brian,
Just Sonya</font>. Visiting: <font color="#FF0000">Stuff Me</font> (Boston), <font color="#FF0000">Just
Patrolman</font> (Tiverton P.D.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The evening got off to an auspicious start,
when at 6:20, the Tiverton Police arrived, to investigate reports of unusual
activity in an area usually reserved for young lovers and pedophiles. An open
gun battle was narrowly averted by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, who
quickly proclaimed that the group had gathered to indulge in ritual bestiality
with the dogs. The Patrolman accepted this and departed with a wistful glance at
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> Glow-in-the-dark underwear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The beginning of the adventure was
punctuated by the discovery that the hare had unwisely chosen pink (for
Valentine's Day) flour to mark trail, making his marks almost invisible. His
explanation that the marks were designed to mislead the color-blind yet
strangely absent <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom-Boom</font> was not accepted
by the pack. The check marks in the shape of Valentine Hearts didn't help
either. (Although <font color="#FF0000">Just Sonya</font> thought they were
cute.) It was only the hare's 500,000 candlepower torch that prevented the hash
from disbanding in disgust.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The pack headed east with tortoise-like
speed. First downhill, then uphill, and not 200 yards before <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
wandered off, in the company of Jake. Finding and losing trail at least 20
times, the bushwacking pack came upon a swamp which had overflowed into an
abandoned road. Opting to keep their feet dry and ignoring the medicinal
qualities of Tiverton swamp-water, they plunged into briars, unlike any they had
ever known, risking sporotrichosis (Rose-picker's disease), tetanus, and coyote
attack. The wise hare kept to the road and got his feet wet, knowing the fine
insulating qualities of frozen sweat pants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next segment came at an abandoned RV
campsite, where a prolonged bad trail downhill on packed ice sent many of the
pack careening on their posteriors, wishing they had brought their skates.
Recovering, they turned south, into the woods, across a field, into more woods,
deeper and deeper with great foreboding. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had
rejoined the group, so <font color="#FF0000">Wipos</font> promptly got lost,
missing the beer stop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The beer (Warsteiner and Buzzard's Bay West
Porter) was enjoyed in a seemly and sedate manner, and the run resumed. The pack
plunged down a cliff face to be confronted by the raging waters of the &quot;Sin
and Flesh&quot; brook. With Puckish humor, the hare had laid the trail so that
the brook was crossed three times. Unfortunately, no one received a Tiverton
baptism. Back on a path for the first time, the trail led gradually back to the
roads and the cars where <font color="#FF0000">Wipos</font> was found, drinking
his own antifreeze in lieu of the beer he had missed</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The circle was marked by the mellifluous
bass tones of the Hare singing &quot;In Mobile&quot;, as well as a generalized
scramble to avoid the Hashit. The pack moved on to the Li'l Bear Lounge where
pizza and beer were consumed. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> wanked off into
the night as usual, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> stole pizza crusts to
feed his hounds, and <font color="#FF0000">Dr.W.H.O</font>. warned his cousin
about the dangers of associating with Navy men. All were satisfied, basking in
the afterglow of the ideal virgin hash.</font></p>
