      <font color="#0000ff">The Run:</font> <br/><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The hare picked a new starting point (for everyone except of course, Bondo and Basket) in the well-hashed town of Smithfield. The group gathered in a part of Spragueville notable mainly for the politically incorrect street names, all using 1950&rsquo;s &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; names. (Tomahawk Trail, Peacepipe Trail, Wampum Circle, etc.) Having some Native American blood, your scribe can tell you, he was mighty offended. Unkh-gawa! <p></p></span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">
      <span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">At 6:30 sharp, they were off. Trail led east, and after crossing the Blackhawk Trail, led straight across a ball field into the woods. There was some light shiggy, but few checks, so progress was rapid as the group moved south and turned back east, parallel to the Stillwater River. Just before reaching Route 5, they did what they had to do, and crossed the stream. Not a very wet one, though.<p></p></span>
    </p>
    <p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">
      <span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Trail led out (across another ball field) to the Smithfield High School grounds. The marks were sparse, but Flexi and Shemale Man were able to lead the pack back across the &ldquo;River&rdquo; again and west to Lisa Ann Circle. A check started some confusion, and it was fully dark by this point. Trail went northwest on the road. Somehow, the pack got into an endless loop, following the trail that they had already traversed. This allowed the pack to come together, except for Bondo, who was lost somewhere, possibly smoking his peacepipe.<p></p></span>

    <p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">
      <span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Finally, one of the fast wankers, CEP or Fuwangi, maybe, found true trail continuing southwest. They crossed a large field and found a dirt road that led to a quiet neighborhood. It was not quiet for long. The pavement was most unwelcome (as were the hashers). They meandered northwest until they re-entered the woods off Lodgepole Lane, and very soon, found the beer check in an old dirt and gravel works.<p></p></span>

    <p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">
      <span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Beer and song began. There was much whining when Bondo arrived. The usual. Once finished, trail back was brief. East to the senior center, and the cars. They had a bit of a walk to find an out-of-sight location for the circle, but once gathered, the ratings began. Virgin territory, one bimbo, slight shiggy, one great area of confusion were the positives. But no one lost, considerable pavement, and the presence of Basket and Bondo were enough. Total: -0.69. Hashit went to Shemale Man AND Basket. The On On On was at Tickers, where they had not replenished their stores of pickled eggs, but at least they had power-washed their parking lot.</span>
