<p><font color="#008000">Run #950</font>, 28 June, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location: </font>Gators, Rt 102, North Smithfield</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Low 70’s, partly cloudy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>  <font color="#FF0000">Dr W.H.O., Fuwangi Boner, Tinker, Oozing S.D., SESYB, 
Seamus.</font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Non-Runners:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi,. Jake, Ben, Dogmeat, Just Big Sh*t,</font> 
Several small children and their mother.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Yet again, last-minute confusion as to the identity of the hare led to a pathetic trail, with a pathetic group of 
no-life wankers showing up, their pathetic little lives brightening up momentarily at the thought of a decent hash. Ha! 
The hare has so overused this area that there really was no point in showing up at all. But try to tell these morons
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turn up week after week!</p>

<p>Your scribe had reverted to summary form to describe this trail, but when it was finished, it didn’t even make a 
complete sentence. It’ll have to described in some tortuous detail, to even make a paragraph. That’s the kind of trail 
this was! Starting from Gator’s on Rt 102, they gathered and watched the beach volleyball being played next to the 
parking lot. Thankfully, no visitors came, to bear witness to what was to follow. The hare arrived, and they set out 
slightly late, at 6:45, through a new house excavation in the back of the parking lot.</p>

<p>Ok, then. They circled up back at the… Allright, allright! There was a BIT more! But you know when even <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> is too smart to come out, it must be bad. The trail led west on Main Street on the small 
causeway over the last of the Slatersville Reservoirs. It soon turned north into the woods, where it went uphill on a 
dirt road, then had a few checks that fooled no one. There was a fallen log. There were some thorns. One tree had a 
squirrel’s nest in it. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> saw a chipmunk. There was a stone wall in bad repair. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and Fuwangi easily led as they turned northeast. There were some more briars. But no one got 
cut. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> stopped to smell some wild lilacs. There were lots of old leaves on the 
ground.</p>

<p>They came out on Northwood Lane. This street had several houses on it. Some of them were nice. Mostly three or four 
bedroom, probably. I think there was a fire hydrant, too. They then emerged on North Main, headed for Pacheco Park. “BN” 
was sighted across Main Street by an old Mill, and trail led to the reservoir side of the canal after crossing a small 
bridge. There was a chain link fence near the bridge. And a nice bench. But it had bird sh*t on it. Too bad.</p>

<p>There were several potential dam crossings here. One went right. One was straight. But trail ended. There were lots 
of bushes at the last flour mark, though. They all gathered, dry shoes and all.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was 
not sweaty. Seamus had no froth.  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker’s</font> hips felt great. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing’s</font> knee was fine. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB </font>hadn’t needed her gaiters, after all. The hare 
produced some beer. They had their beer. They used really small cups. Each of them had at least four or five beers. 
But they were real small. They finished their beer. They turned back out to Main Street and ran the hard pavement back 
to the cars. Tinker was garlanded with some fluorescent Road workers tape that <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> found. 
He looked really funny. They all laughed. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> had to take a leak from all that beer. 
He pretended to find trail up to the reservoir, and whizzed into the water. The water in Woonsocket may taste funny 
next week. They reached their cars. The volleyball players had scored at least seven points since the hash set out, but 
had not finished their set.</p>

<p>Ok, then. They circled up back at the hare’s house. The run had only one positive comment: <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> had not bothered to show up. This was significant enough to make the rating a solid 0! Hashit went to not 
one, not two, but three! <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Oozing</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>were all 
found to be guilty for the trail: one for setting, one for not setting, and one for skipping the ordeal altogether (as 
well as for subjecting small children to the influences of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Dr WHO</font>).</p>

<p>Finally, they were able to enjoy a fine barbequed meal of sausages and beans, courtesy of <font color="#FF0000">
Dogmeat</font>. They were even able to linger well into the evening, with all that extra time on their hands. No one 
jumped into the pool. But they stood around and looked at <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> fountain a lot. <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> was back in Cumberland before the liquor stores closed, and started drinking for real. 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB </font>made the early show of “Fahrenheit 9/11”.
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>was back in Wickford in time to watch the reruns of “Sabrina the Teenaged Witch” 
and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> made it to Tiverton in time to water the lawn before bed. <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> passed out on the couch, his grandkids giggling at his snores. But just wait till next week!</p>
