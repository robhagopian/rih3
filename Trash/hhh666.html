<BR><font color="#3366FF">Who was there:</font><BR><BR><font color="#FF0000">Oozing 
Syph</font> (hare), <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo Jovi, Jake, Buster</font> (GM),
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>,<BR><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS's Bitch-in-heat, 
Async, Basket, Little Neck</font>, and <font color="#FF0000"> Itchy Brother</font><P><BR><font color="#3333FF">Who was not there:</font>
<P><font color="#FF0000"> Trail Hoover</font> 
(Co-hare, had enough of <font color="#FF0000"> Ooozing</font> the day<BR>before),
<font color="#FF0000"> Cheap Licker</font> (date with Joe 
Mechanic, stood up the hash), and many<BR>other wimps that couldn't take the 
cold…What?  It's not that cold. It's up to<BR>a balmy 18 degrees F., with a mild 
30-knot breeze.<BR><BR>The hare was dressed in a devilishly delicious red 
outfit, which fit well to<BR>the theme.  An impatient <font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> and his 4 legged 
hounds departed early, to make<BR>the grade up the steep trail a lollygag 
affair.  Soon after the hare gave<BR>directions, and the rest of the pack found 
trail along the vacant parking lots<BR>of Diamond Hill Park.  A check had the 
hounds checking up and down the<BR>vertical cliffs of the old ski area.  
Confused at first by the lack of clearly<BR>marked white flour on white granite 
rock; the hare called the pack on still<BR>higher.<BR><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was found at the top 
calling &quot;On F&quot;, and thinking he said &quot;B&quot; we<BR>converged on 
his spot only to be found off trail at a false.  <BR><font color="#FF0000">Async</font> found trail again and 
lost it quickly, but using his inStincks, he<BR>continued straight uphill.  The 
bulk of the pack followed the trail like<BR>lemings, as once again <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing
</font> 
pointed the way.  <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font> was by this time<BR>missing his co-hare, and as many of 
the pack complained of missing marks, he<BR>explained that; &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> 
set this part&quot;.  The devilish hare had us cover<BR>every inch of the old 
ski trail network, and eventually we found beer hidden<BR>at a high overlook at 
the headwall. <BR>A hellish wind blew straight in our faces, but it didn't deter 
our singing and<BR>beer slugging.  <font color="#FF0000"> WIPOS's bitch</font> tried to Butt Fuck our Grand 
Master. Not having<BR>a dick didn't deter her from humping Buster. <font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font> looked 
on jealously as he<BR>remembered <font color="#FF0000">Jake'</font>s throbbing member up his butt at last 
week's hash.  Soon<BR>whining began about the fuckin' cold and the pack started 
downhill.<BR>We eventually wound up at the start, and circled up to Down-down's 
and song.<BR><font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font> drank for the hare's; <font color="#FF0000"> WIPOS</font> for the Hashit offense of his 
bitch fucking<BR>the Grand Master, and the fastest Swing Low in history had us 
off to the OnOn.<BR>Guinness and Bass Ale pitchers were quickly placed in front 
of us at Grumpy's<BR>and food was quickly devoured before we adjourned to our 
homes for the night.<BR>The run was rated a generous 6.9, even though most of 
the trail was stolen<BR>from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, on the&quot;Shortest Trail of 98&quot;, but 
it lacked the spontaneity and<BR>interests (home brew) of a Bondo Hash.<BR>
