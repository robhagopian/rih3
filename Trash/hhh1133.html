December 17, 2007</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">Hare:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuwangi Boner</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">Location:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;North Cumberland Middle School</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">Weather:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;: Low 20s, 12 inches of Ice-crusted Snow</p>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">The Run:</span></p>

<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">Returning yet again to the scene of his misspent youth, the
hare was blest with freezing weather and 8-12" of day old snow, crusted with
ice. The weather took its toll on attendance. Only those with no life
whatsoever showed up. And of course, the hare planned both a whiskey check and
a beer check. Promptly at six-thirty, fearing a late appearance by <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Bondo</span> or
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WIPOS</span>, they were off.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Trail was marked in colored flour. Not that it was really
needed: footprints were more than enough. They left the back of the school
parking lot on the crosscountry trails and headed uphill. With each step, the
ice caught their shins just above the ankles. So the run quickly became a
competiton to see who could avoid leading the&nbsp;pack, and let the others break
up the ice. Climbing northeast, there were a few checks. At first it was
obvious: pick the trail without footprints. The hare had been using the
bushwhack-to-leave-no marks-on-the-true-trail technique. How clever! As they
wound up the hill, they came to a rock and a whiskey check. There was plenty of
whiskey for all present.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Warmed a bit, they resumed trail, and continued east and
downhill. The stream was crossed easily, and after about a half mile they came
to the beer check. There was plenty of beer for all present. A few songs were
sung as the hash defiantly tried to proclaim to uncaring nature that they were
in fact having a good time and were not merely pathetic losers running in the
snaow because they have NO LIFE! But I digress. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Moving on, <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket's</span> true nature came out as he tried to find
trail northeast and uphill. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WHO</span>, having set trail here before, found the right
path southeast, and tied to get the hare and <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Concrete</span> to turn off their lights
and keep it quiet in the hope of losing <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span>. No such luck. He caught up just
as they came back to the school.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">They circled up. Ratings for the run: Fine shin-bruising ice
shiggy, plentiful alcohol, and no <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Bondo</span> stacked up against no Bimbos, and no
one lost. Total: +0.69. Hashit: <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Concrete</span> <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Feet</span>. Why? <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WHO</span> knows. On they went to Tucks,
where they had a quiet evening meal at their usual table, although their usual
waitress was missing. Pathetic! Just like this write-up.</p>
