Unfortunately, the weather for this hash was good. But, then again, the
directions were not. <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>, in characteristic
fashion, posted directions which sent most of the seventy or eighty hashers who
had eagerly planned to attend this night's hash off into the darkness of central
southern Massachusetts, without a clue as to where to gather for the start. As a
result, only nine arrived, and those only because they knew to turn right
whenever <font color="#FF0000">Shine On's</font> directions said left. I have
heard, on CNN, that forty five people were apprehended in eastern Connecticut
for disorderly conduct on this same evening. Twenty were dressed as George
Washington, seventeen as Abraham Lincoln, and, inexplicably, eight as Rutherford
B. Hayes.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The run began. The run almost stopped immediately
when it was realized that <font color="#FF0000">Shine On's</font> hash marks
where invisible to all but the super-human. Apparently, in an effort to avoid
putting flour on the snow covered ground, she had decided to use her vast
reserves of rouge, kept in her secret make-up shed (much coveted by the teenage
daughters of <font color="#FF0000">Dr W.H.O</font>.). She picked a flesh-tone,
guaranteeing total confusion. I am sure she found the results acceptable. The
pack thought otherwise. Even with the aid of <font color="#FF0000">Dr W.H.O.'s</font>
light (Torchzilla) little of the real trail could be seen.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The pack headed west and then south, following
trail almost only by instinct. Lake Wallum was reached, along with what appeared
to be the end of the trail.<font color="#FF0000"> Just John</font>, hungry for
sustenance, decided to fish using his feet and legs for bait in Lake Wallum. No
bites, and he decided to rejoin the pack. A mark was found. Then another. The
trail, if it could be called such, moved northwest through the woods, off path,
in a swamp which in warmer weather would have provided most gratifying shiggy.
As it was, it was merely annoying. The pack vocally wished that <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> would henceforth keep her bush-whacking in the privacy of her own
home, where it belonged.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Trail was re-established on a wide, boring trail:
an obvious circle. But <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>, knowing of the
invisibility of her marks, still had a few tricks up her sleeve (or elsewhere on
her person). <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom-boom</font> took the lead, and
carried it further and further, until it became clear that he had access to <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On's</font> secret-of-secrets. &nbsp;I mean her trail. No, really. The rest of
the pack came to a major confluence of trails, with no clear evidence that they
weren't totally lost except a single rouge mark in the snow, in the shape of two
buttocks, with no indication of which way to proceed. <font color="#FF0000">The
Just crowd</font> suggested turning left, immediately indicating to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
that right was the way to go. So, Dr W.H.O. went straight. WIPOS was camping out
at the intersection. When all had regrouped, using almost uncanny orienteering
skills,<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> was followed into the dark night.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After a while, the sounds of orgasmic dogs were
heard in the distance. The pack followed the trail for a while, knowing that the
security of their automobiles was not far away. But, the siren call of the
beer-stop lured them away from security, and they plunged down a hill, into
thigh deep drifts, in search of the horny hounds. The jeers of the unworthy
SCB's served as a guide to bring the pack through the holly and rhododendrons to
the beer-stop, where a suspiciously urbane <font color="#FF0000">Funky Diva</font>
greeted the group, saying: &quot;I say, chaps! Why are you so red in the bloody
face?&quot; <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> refused to reply to the Navy
accusations of communistic sympathies reflected in her choice of trail marks.
Basket, obviously employing secret electronic C.I.A. technology designed to
detect the &quot;widgets&quot; in cans of Guiness, declined to answer the
question of how he had managed to find the beer before the rest of the pack.
Nevertheless, there was beer, so the raging pack was calmed. One song was sung,
although if the ultimate decision as to whether Incest, Bestiality, or
Necrophilia is best was made, your scribe cannot recall.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On-on into the night, although the trail from
this point on gave mundane a bad name. The cars were reached, Bondo-brew was
poured and the circle was joined. The hare, in the circle, received the dreaded
&quot;Lovely Run&quot; from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. And it was
downhill from there. <font color="#FF0000">Just-Sonya</font> (or
She-who-must-be-named) said that it was a &quot;fun run&quot;, sealing <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On's</font> fate. The hare was forced to sing, given the lack of interest in her
&quot;ring&quot;, and soundly performed an Irish curse, visiting venereal
infection upon all present. All inspected their jewels. After a cephalosporin
injection from<font color="#FF0000"> Dr W.H.O.</font> for some, the group was
ready to proceed to the next item on the agenda: the Namings. <font color="#FF0000">Just-Nate</font>,
suffering from weeks of confusion with <font color="#FF0000">Just-Brian,</font>
announced his sex change, and was temporarily designated <font color="#FF0000">Just-Loretta</font>.
This would not do. After a rousing recital of &quot;Yukon Pete&quot; by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
it was clear that nothing less than &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Big Ass Lil</font>&quot;
would allow this confused young squid to blossom in the hash world. As for <font color="#FF0000">Just-Sonya</font>,
(or Sonia) all, including <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>, agreed that it
would be nice to Cumonya. I mean that is, to name her <font color="#FF0000">Cumonya</font>.
Goes without saying, after all.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The On-in was marked by the same thoughtful and
painstaking attention to detail that marked the rest of this run. In other
words, none! The remnants of the pack that had not packed emergency provisions
in their vehicles, fearing another version of the horror at Donner Pass, headed
into Uxbridge, to Hannah's, where they where informed that the &quot;kitchens
were closed&quot;. Rather than eating <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> they
sent him off into the wilderness, where he miraculously procured pizza. The pack
was satisfied, although all agreed that as punishment for the trail set, <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> should be required to wear mirror sun-glasses with the darkest tint
for all Rhode Island hashes during the winter and spring seasons in the next
year, and her flashlight be limited to no more than 2 Candlepower during the
same timeframe.<br>
