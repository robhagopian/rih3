<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>It has been a long time between the run and this write-up. And I for one am sick of waiting for <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> to get off their *sses and write the f**ker up. So 
I have decided to do it myself. (<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> has been doing too much of that lately, doing it 
himself, I mean, the wank!) And this’ll be a real write-up. None of those candy-*ssed bullsh*t asterixes or anything. I 
mean, what the F**K! [Editor’s Note: I like asterixes. Tough t*tty, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>!]</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was first to arrive, as usual. He needs a f**kin’ life! But I soon brightened his day 
and joined him. For a moment we thought we might be in the wrong place. A bunch of walkers, dogs and fishermen wandered 
through. But soon hashers began to arrive. In addition to the usual f**ks, a visitor and a virgin arrived. <font 
color="#FF0000">Gives Great Head</font> had moved east recently from the Bay area in CA. He had brought a friend, <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Nat</font>, from Warwick. They were welcomed. F**kin’ A! <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> also ran 
into <font color="#FF0000">Just Evelyn</font>. She had cum on three or four previous hashes. But as usual, she said she 
couldn’t run  with us. She had donated a kidney to her husband 2 weeks ago. Some sh*t excuse! <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> offered to write her a doctor’s note allowing her to run. She declined. Go figure! At least she wasn’t headed for 
the airport.</p>

<p>At six-thirty, we were off. Working quickly, I chose the wrong path, heading northwest. For f**k’s sake, how am I 
supposed to know which way to go. The hare, terrified of being left alone with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, called 
us back frantically. But <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> found true trail. Lucky 
f**ks! They led north about as fast as f**king grass growing, on the causeway between parts of Belleville Pond. We all 
knew this trail pretty well. So it wasn’t hard to get through a few checks to the Railroad grade northwest, angling away 
from the pond. I forgot for a while who was hare. No, not f**kin’ <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>! <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font>! And a “Tinker” check was due. When we came to a check in the middle of the grade, I continued straight, 
egged on by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, the f**kin’ f**k! <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Pounder</font> milled about confused. But <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> turned back and gave the signal to our visitors. Dubiously, they followed him east onto an overgrown path about 50 
yards before the check. Sure enough, there was flour out on Warburton Ave, leading out to Rt 102.</p>

<p>Across 102 we went, entering the parking lot of Paul Bailey Ford. The farm animals usually seen on the right were 
quiet. I was f**kin’ disappointed. I knew a goat there once, if you get my drift. Sh*te! Trail continued as it always has 
out the back of the lot into Cocumcussoc State Park. <font color="#FF0000">Gives Great Head</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Nat</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> were together. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> the 
f**k only knew what they were up to! They came to a maze of checks, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> Checks and 
falsies. They were very confused. They were miserable f**ks! <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and I caught up. Their misery increased. We brought a swarm of 
deer-flies with us. Their misery was f**kin’ unbounded! Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> found true trail 
curving west. This was by following the low ground in search of mud. Or sh*t. Smart. He led the newcomers. Trail was 
straight for a while. We crossed a small stream on a wooden bridge. One of the leaders, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
do you think, removed the wooden bridge. That f**kin’ f**k! Why didn’t I think of that?</p>

<p>Trail then led south to an abandoned house. I was leading as we crossed 102 to find the lazy-*ssed hare, sitting next 
to his car. He pointed over to a small pond where the BC was to be found. Reused BC, from a few Halloween’s ago. What a 
d**khead! A cooler was found. I waited until <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> were jumping in the pond, and stole the beer. What a f**kin’ laugh! They were too 
f**kin’ lazy to come get it, so we had a few, me and the new guys, who thought this was normal. I was getting a little 
nervous though. <font color="#FF0000">Gives Great Head</font> had really muddy knees. What the f**k!</p>

<p>Well, the wanks at the pond had the Cheetos, so when <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> came and stole the cooler 
back, we didn’t fight it. And we wanted to see <font color="#FF0000">SESYB’s</font> nipples after she jumped in the cool 
water. Those things could poke your f**kin’ eye out! But it was a very disappointing beer check. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> made it. And just when you thought it couldn’t get any worse, along comes <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. F**k!</p>

<p>The on out trail led <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Nat</font> on a circle jerk through Feurer Park. I hung back. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was promised a shortcut. We moved on heading southwest to some powerlines. We briefly went 
south, but trail doubled back east. I of course, had no problems figuring this out. So I led <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Gives Great Head</font> south crossing Lafayette Road. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>, the dumb f**k, decides to take off on his own. He was seen by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Nat</font>. The stupid f**ks led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>, decided to follow. I think the powerlines definitely affect <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> brain. Or maybe 
he’s just a dumb f**k all the time. The wanks crossed a swamp, and headed west to Rt 4, and a dead end. Ha, f**kin’ Ha!!
</p>

<p>I led <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">GGH</font> on true trail south without incident. We 
crossed through some fields back in Ryan Park now, and came to a parking lot on Oak Hill Road. The hare was there, 
smirking. He said that we were going to circle here, so we left <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and drove back to get 
some cars. Lucky us, we meet up with <font color="#FF0000">Sneezergasm</font> at the parking lot. That’s one way for the 
hare to pad his bimbo attendance numbers. Meanwhile, back with the DFLs, supposedly <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
took over from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. I don’t know about you, but I’ll take retarded over blind any day! He 
led them east to the RR grade (Right!), but chose north (Wrong!) <font color="#FF0000">Just Nat</font> followed. Poor 
f**k! <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> turned south, and led <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> across Lafayette Road. Too bad they couldn’t lose the *sshole permanently! They continued 
south on the dirt road through the fields, without f**king up any more than usual. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
clued them in. While waiting for us to get back, a runner came by and asked what was going on. He was recruited to the 
circle. <font color="#FF0000">Just Mike</font>. Another f**k who’ll never be seen again! Especially after <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> showed up. Sh*t!</p>

<p>The convoy arrived. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Michelle</font>, and <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> were missing. Great f**kin’ work, hare! Lose the bimbos, and leave us with <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>! F**k! The circle was started. Just as the ratings 
began, the lost f**ks finally showed up. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> looked like his gear had been messed up a bit. 
Lucky d*ckwad! The run was given good numbers by the wankers trying to suck up as usual. For me: no f**kin’ shiggy, no 
f**kin’ injuries, no one lost on the f**kin’ trail. I don’t know what the total was, but I’m the one doing the f**kin’ 
write-up. -69! Ha! The hare cut the circle short so’s we could get food at the Oakhill Tavern. We drove back to the cars, 
and headed for the restaurant.<p>

<p>F**kin’ brilliant! Half of the *ssholes got lost. The other half found out that there was no f**kin’ food left at the 
f**kin’ place! The cellphones came out, and we went to plan B: a place called Gillian’s on Rt 1A. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, the lucky f**k, wanked off into the night. The rest of us made it to two tables in the back, 
and finished up the circle. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Why the f**k not? The virgin was queried: 
<font color="#FF0000">GGH</font> made him cum, favorite barnyard animal is goats, yada, yada, yada. We tried renaming 
<font color="#FF0000">Pounder On It</font>: “Disaster Bi Design”, “Leave it to Cleavage”, etc. F**kin’ lame!</p>

<p>They had a wine special, dinner and a bottle for two, so some of us (who aren’t uncultured f**ks like the rest of you 
wanks) took advantage. We sang some and seemed to be getting away with our usual sh*t. I was sipping my wine, and didn’t 
notice <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> spewing some “Beer” across the table. And why the f**k would I notice that? 
He’s always spewing something. He set his “beer” down and I of course, grabbed it. I took a sip. Everyone was watching me, 
the f**ks! It might have been the wine, but something tasted funny. But pretty good, actually. <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> said it was his special IPA, warmed to body temperature. [Editors Note: I believe he meant: “I pee, Eh?”]. I think 
he might have been f**king with me. But what the f**k! Heigh Ho. And that’s what we did. F**k you all, you f**kin’ 
f**ks!</p>
