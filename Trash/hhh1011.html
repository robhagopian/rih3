<p><font color="#008000">Run #1011</font>, August 15, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Trail Hoover (SESYB)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Wrentham, MA (Wrentham State Forest).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 70’s, cloudy and humid.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Ben, Seamus, Just Nathaniel, Sparky the Hobosexual (NH3), Naughty Bi Nature 
(NH3, a.k.a. Just Michelle, a.k.a. Pond Her On It), Snotty (Henfield H3), Dry Foot Fairy, WIPOS, Tinker, Dr. WHO, Bondo 
Jovi, and Basket Boom Boom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>After many undisclosed bribes, <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Naughty</font> 
(Newport/Rhodie fence-sitters, who deny any linkage to bowling alleys (sure, yeah, whatever they say)) arrived with and at 
the behest of <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> didn’t require bribery.  
Rather, he was looking for payback from his beer offering from the previous week – he received nothing.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> from Henfield H3, en route back to England, attended the hash after receiving lavish payment 
from <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (what <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> used as compensation can only be left 
to the world of speculation, where it should stay).  Unfortunately, no amount of bribery could keep <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> away, while <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, and 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> remained in the lonely company of the innocent.  Or were they?  And with that, the 
sorry-looking group was off, heading south out of the Wrentham State Forest parking lot, located along Taunton St. just 
north of Rt. 495.</p>

<p>The trail quickly reached 495, thus the only option was to go westward, paralleling the highway.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> blazed away.  Soon, a mark led to a deep, dark 
orifice.  Who might be lured into this hole from which natural fluids passes?  No, this time, <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> was not attracted.  It was <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> who curiously and eagerly penetrated this conduit 
leading south underneath the highway.  Blasts of air, reverberating through a wet pucker, made horrific sounds… just
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, sounding his horn to announce his successful penetration of this dark passage.</p>

<p>The rest followed.  Pathetic.  When will they ever learn?</p>

<p>Exiting the dark tunnel, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was briefly blinded by the light.  He disappointingly 
followed the creek bed until another tunnel beckoned him to enter.  So he did, with the others quickly gaining ground.  
Exiting the second tunnel, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was giddy as he penetrated two dark holes in one day, the 
most he’s gotten in a long time!  <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> were no 
less appreciative of the offerings by the hare.  Smiles and all were quickly quenched by a “BC 8” (translation, back check 
8).  The trio of jerks decided to sucker the other jerks into the back check.  To make their efforts believable the three 
jerks ran in a circle past and around the back check.  Watching the rest of the jerks being suckered, they re-entered the 
orifice for a speedy yet satisfying reciprocation in direction.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> stood waiting at the opening of the first tunnel, as he appeared to be weary of 
anything deep, dark, slippery, and wet.  Hmmm…. No comment.</p>

<p><br>Less than 10 minutes into the run, comments included:</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>: “F*ck, I see this sh*t every day.  I should get paid for this!”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>:  “Woo hoo, woo hoo hooo!”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>:  “Sh*it, I’m following <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  When will I ever 
learn?”  (um, never)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font>:  “I came across the pond for this bloody Yankee sh*t.  Bugger!  Bugger!  Bugger!” 
 (which was exactly what he was doing.)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font>:  “Hey, this is kinda fun!”  (that’s how it all starts… that’s how it all 
starts.)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font>:  “Oh, this looks quite familiar.  I think I have a picture of this from my 
colonoscopy exam.”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>:  “At my age, I thought I’ve seen everything.  Oh well… Bonsai!!!”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Naughty</font>:  “If I push against the sides, can I keep from getting wet?”  (But why?  But 
why???)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>:  “Where the f*ck are those f*ckin f*cks!”  (in Bondo’s better interest, it was 
best he was lost somewhere on the other side of Taunton St., as this experience for sure would have him in a state of 
traumatic emotional shock, or transic euphoric delight… but who knows?  Does <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> know?  
Who knows if <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows?  …as usual, I digress.)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>:  “I knew you guys would love it!”</p>

<p>Seamus:  “This is why I only sniff it.  And they thought WE were the dirty animals!”</p>

<p>Ben:  “What, you don’t lick it?”</p>

<p><br>Anywhooooo….  After multiple satisfying penetrations of the multiple holes, true trail led westward along the north 
side of the highway.  Continued to be led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, 
they soon reached a check on Hollow Rock Trail.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> went northward, while <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> jetted off to the northeast.  The rest followed and then stopped, since calls by <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> were just a little too eager for <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> to follow.  <font color="#FF0000">Sparky
</font>, not realizing the mistrust of the others, plowed ahead anyway, and followed <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> 
and others in a long circle jerk (more accurately described as a jerk circle).  But only <font color="#FF0000">Dr. 
WHO</font> managed to complete the entire circle, thus being the true jerk.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unbelievably <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was on true trail and the FRB, with <font 
color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> in tow, heading north along Warner Trail.  A check allowed most, including the hare, to 
catch up to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  Then the pack, on a side trail, reached back yards of suburban homes.  
They sheepishly stopped, for none wanted to find themselves in the back seat of a cruiser.  The hare pointed straight, 
entering the periphery of private property, and all dutifully obeyed.  They emptied out onto Beech St., where trail 
continued northwest.</p>

<p>They re-engaged Warner Trail heading north on the other side of Beech St and quickly reaching two swampy ponds, leaving 
some to wonder if leeches were in their future.  At the check <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went west, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> searched south, and <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> looked northwest.  Nobody 
chose true trail, which headed north.  The hare directed everyone into creating another jerk circle around the pond, as 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Naughty</font> (stupidly) obeyed.  The rest behind them saw 
<font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> on the opposite side of the pond and abandoned the second jerk circle.</p>

<p>Trail then headed up a hill were the beer check was reached with a nice view of Wrentham for all to enjoy.  A medley of 
Harpoon and cheetos were savored.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was still missing, but nobody cared.  After the beer 
check, trail went straight down the abandoned ski slope.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> were having fun pretending to ski down the slope, until the runaway freight train 
<font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> came barreling down the slope, poised to take out the two ahead of him.  With cat-like 
reflexes, the two managed to avert <font color="#FF0000">Sparky</font> as he flew down the hill and yard-saled at the 
bottom of the slope, quite reminiscent of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> misadventure on skis during Run 
<a href="hhh981.html">#981</a>.</p>

<p>With everyone safely down the slope, a check confused most, which led to <font color="#FF0000">Naughty’s</font> moment 
of hashing glory as she was FRB!  True trail finally bent southward and met up to Taunton St. where it was a straight shot 
south along Taunton St., and the last half mile back on darkening wooded trails to the parking lot to be met by…. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  No hash is perfect.</p>

<p>Circle was held and a pathetic display of sucking up to the hare ensued.  [Did I say pathetic?  I’ll say it again… 
paaaaaaaathetic.  I digress.]  What was even more pathetic was the display of chicken sh*ts after a police cruiser pulled 
into the parking lot.  Even <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> was dismayed at the mass confusion and anxiety at the 
sight of a cop.  Nevertheless, despite all the sucking up to the hare, the mathematical total for the run equaled a 
<b>+6.9!</b>  Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, for no apparent reason whatsoever.</p>

<p>On-on-on was a Box Seats in North Attleboro, and Seamus expressed much joy for the departure of the circle full of 
jerks.  A failed attempt at an impromptu naming for <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> to "Amish It Head" 
failed due to a hashing technicality.  There are rules in hashing?  We’ll see next week.</p>

<p>And with that, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> missed the best hash ever!  Perhaps when <font color="#FF0000">
Snotty</font> returns to England, he can be a character witness and help spring <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> out of 
indefinite detention.  But then again, <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> as a character witness might not help 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> case.</p>

<i><p><br>Prime Minister Blair:  “Mister <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  Given the powers afforded to me by the 
British Parliament and the British constitution, I hereby declare you to be detained indefinitely.  For the sake of your 
family, their children, and the children of Britain, I implore you, on behalf of all peace-loving citizens of Britain, to 
confess your guilt and help us expose this reign of terror crippling our society at its very roots.  And you cannot deny 
your association with this auspicious underground cult that calls itself the hash house harriers.”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>:  “Prime Minister Blair.  May I ask you one question?  Why are you George Bush’s 
bitch?”</p>

<p>Blair:  [begins sobbing uncontrollably]  “He.. he.. he.. [sob] he’s just sooo mean, and rough, and.. and.. and.. [sob]  
with that huge belt buckle and enormous cowboy hat and talking like a five year-old… [sniffle]  I hate that bloody Yank!  
[sob]  …but he has these photos of me with…”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>:  “Prime Minister Blair.  May I call you Tony?”</p>

<p>Blair:  [sniffle]  “Uh huh.”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>:  “Tony.  Why don’t we have a seat over here on this couch, you can relax, even lie 
down.  And please tell me all about it, from the very beginning.  Take your time.  Everything you tell me will be held in 
the strictest of confidence, you have my word on it.  But before we begin, I want you to repeat after me:  'It's not 
my fault.'”</p></i>
