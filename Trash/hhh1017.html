<p><i>Scribe’s Note:  If you look at the map below and follow the actual trail, you will see brilliance in setting a trail 
(a) with no false trails, (b) that’s monotonously straight, (c) that terminates two blocks from the hare’s house, (d) that 
has absolutely no virgin territory, (e) with absolutely no shiggy, (f) with no beer check, and (g) destined to get half 
the pack lost albeit trail never wanders further than a half mile from the hare’s home.</i></p>

<p>With the lost of Jake the longstanding RIH3 GM (see Hash <a href="hhh1013.html">#1013</a>), a voting in a new GM was in 
order.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> decided to run again for GM, despite his demoralizing defeat to Jake (see 
Hash <a href="hhh823.html">#823</a>).  He was voted in by the slimmest of margins.  His victory, however, was to be 
short-lived, as scandals began to surface.  Thus, 69 seconds later, he was impeached from his post.  Succession of power 
was still uncertain, but GM would likely fall onto the paws of either Seamus or Ben.</p>

<p>As the misty drizzle turned into a light rain, the pack was off heading back down Meadow street to Cold Spring Park.  
At the check, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> headed directly into the Park while <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
successfully found trail heading northwest along Harris Ave.  Trail then turned northeast along Gaskill St., as <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> led the fading pack.  There were at least three 
checks along Gaskill St., but true trail continued straight to North Main St.</p>

<p>About this time, <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> arrived to empty cars of familiar hashers (she will soon learn 
that RIH3 does not go by HST).  She followed the on-out arrow down Meadow St. to Harris Ave. where she lost trail.  Little 
did she know that marks were on the telephone poles, as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> continued to be mistaken for a 
Verizon employee gone mad.  Nevertheless, demonstrating the enthusiasm of a true hasher, she decided to turn around and 
return to the cars, where she ran into another over-achieving hasher <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, who on 
this day walked around a bit.  They opted to return to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> for bondo brew and the company 
of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  [scratching head in bewilderment, but I digress]</p>

<p>Back on trail, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> took turns leading the pack 
as trail now headed southeast along North Main St.  At this time, any sighting of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had 
long been lost.  Wanting to emulate <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> too decided 
to run in his boxers (at least they weren’t skimpies).  Naturally, this surely meant that he would get lost somewhere in 
downtown Woonsocket, to be picked up by the police.  Fortunately for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, the Woonsocket 
cops knew <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> well.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, somewhere along High School St., Spring St.,.Glen Rd., and Oakley Rd., the hare decided to make a trail 
something other than miles of straight pavement.  This threw everyone, including <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, into 
a confused mass, which really meant that the wankers were forced to think.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, otherwise 
destined to get lost, knew the area just as well as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, thus he quickly led <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> back to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> place.  By now, one might think <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> would find <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> without much effort, but <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> being <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> remained confused with the rest.  Finally, they 
slowly trickled into <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font>, minus <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.</p>

<p>Given that there was NO beer check, no marks to the non-existent beer check, and no on-in, this proved to be one of 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> better efforts.  Ratings on the run measured up to be nine impeached GM’s or one 
collective lost <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  Total: <b>+69!</b>  Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> 
who accepted it for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, in absentia.  How pathetic and definitely deserving of hashit.  
Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> arrived soaked boxers and all.  They all enjoyed hot food and more bondo brew 
at <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> abode with <font color="#FF0000">Just Big Shit</font> supporting this helpless 
bunch.  Not much else to note, except that it must have been the most pathetic AGM in RIH3 history, which really isn’t 
saying much at all.</p>
