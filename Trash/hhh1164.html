<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">It’s been so 
long, your scribe has only memories and a few notes to commemorate this trail. 
It was, surprisingly enough, a fine trail. No <SPAN 
style="COLOR: red">Bondo</SPAN>, no <SPAN style="COLOR: red">Fuwangi</SPAN>, 
fine weather and plenty of shiggy. But no one was lost, there were no lightning 
strikes and <SPAN style="COLOR: red">Just Matt</SPAN> made his first appearance. 
They can’t all be perfect. But regardless, here goes.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Starting from 
the north parking lot at River Point Park in West Warwick, the first example of 
total confusion came from (could it be anyone else?) <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, as he could not follow the hare’s clear directions 
and parked in the wrong area. But he found the pack, worse luck as they started 
a counterclockwise circle around the playing fields. In spite of the 
intermittent drenching rains, a ball game was going on, but they hardly noticed 
the hash as trail led west then south to the bike path. The hare was liberally 
re-marking as they went along as the rains had taken their toll upon his prelaid 
trail. They followed the bike path east to Rt 115 and a check. Confusing, when 
the trail marks were all dissolving in puddles.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Finally, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> found true trail heading north through a lot into the 
woods. Almost immediately they crossed the river in murky water up to the 
thighs. The sewer overflows were working overtime. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Margaret</FONT> was enjoying herself quite a bit. Trail turned north and east. 
The river was crossed again. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> was heard to 
utter his first hash whine. The hare was so proud.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The trail led 
close to the ball fields again, and it would have been tempting to just head 
back for the cars. But the rain was falling, the briars were becoming thicker 
and the beer lay ahead. So on they went. And just before reaching the cars, 
trail crossed the river again. Happy days! Now some dirt bike paths were found 
heading east. Trail marks were better preserved here in the woods, so the hare’s 
assistance was not so necessary. They came to the powerlines and a check which 
was easily mastered. The trail led south. Towards the river. 
Yippee!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Just before the 
river, they found the Beer Check. Ah, what a lovely spot! The rain was holding 
off, just long enough to allow huge and vicious clouds of mosquitoes to descend 
upon the pack. So the singing was slightly abbreviated. But for once there was 
enough beer to go around. Finishing up, they turned west to the fourth and final 
river crossing. A path led straight to the dog pound. Pity Ben wasn’t there to 
re-acquaint himself with the facilities. They regrouped at the cars, and then 
moved slightly into the woods to circle up.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The run was 
rated. It’s not every day that a new hare can get brilliant weather, have four 
river crossings, and have a 25% bimbo contingent, at least in the RIH3. Were it 
not for the fact that no one got lost, it might have been a perfect 69; but he 
had to settle for a +6.9 and “Hash of the Week”! The virgin was initiated, and 
Hashit was given to <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, mainly because <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> seemed too willing to get it yet again, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> had been on a roll lately. Finishing up, they went 
off to the aptly named Sports Bar on Main Street in Phenix. Another fine waste 
of a Monday night!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
