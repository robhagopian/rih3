<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hare set 
trail from the familiar location of Hanna’s in Uxbridge, in honor of <font color="#ff0000">Dogmeat</font>’s birthday, rather than as a tribute to the Fourth 
of July. So no flags, no fireworks and no thought whatsoever went into this 
trail. Of course, “it was supposed to be <font color="#ff0000">Tinker’</font>s 
run…” and “<font color="#ff0000">Snotty</font> doesn’t know what he’s doing…” and 
“my brain hurt’s…” were just a few of the many excuses for this miserable 
recycling of a trail. Poor <font color="#ff0000">Europeein’</font>. She never 
learns!<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The trail began 
with a brief loop behind Hanna’s to the west. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> climbed the ridge and soon found true trail heading east on the old 
train bed. The pack crossed 146a, and soon turned north, just east of the small 
quarry. They were together as they crossed River Road. Except for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT>, who arrived late and was searching for the 
start.Soon, they crossed the River, next to the road. The water was clean. It 
was thigh deep. How dull! They came out into the larger old quarry, now 
overgrown with tall grasses. Ben followed <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> 
as he became lost and confused on the powerlines. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO,</FONT> <FONT color=#ff0000>Swampy</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Europeein’</FONT> became confused in the long grass. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> was confused behind Hanna’s. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> climbed up a rise and saw the hare and co-hare down 
in the quarry, conferring with <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. After a brief 
search for Ben, the dog was found. Too bad.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Finally some 
marks were seen on the powerlines and a check sent <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> west on a gas pipeline. The hares followed, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> returned to his car, back at Hanna’s. They came to 
the river, and paused. Finally, they crossed to find the Beer Check. Beer was 
produced as the stragglers came in. <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> managed to 
steal the hare’s bugle, and re-crossed to leave it on the far side of the 
stream. Ha, ha!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">You can only 
have so much fun in Uxbridge, they say, and the hashes allotment was well 
overspent by this time. So, they packed up and turned southeast on a dirt road. 
Marks were lost again, but the pack made their way through and industrial lot, 
and came back out on 146a. They slowed to a walk (if going any slower were even 
possible!) and followed the road back to Hanna’s. Geriatric hashing at its best. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> had to be awakened in his 
car.<BR><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The Circle was 
regrouped at <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT>, in the pool. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Dogmeat</FONT> arrived, and incessant demands for her birthday 
suit provided a most excellent circle, with <FONT color=#ff0000>Swamp 
Whine</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Dogmeat</FONT> bottomless, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Europeein’ Whore</FONT> in scanty-panties. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> as usual provided the discordant counterpoint and 
was naked. The run was rated. Two River crossings, loss of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT>, three fine bimbos and mild shiggy were countered by 
the failure YET AGAIN, to lose Ben, the pavement, the recycled trail and the 
site of a naked <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> ruining the other views 
available. Total: -0.0 Hashit was given to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, 
for the same reason, invoking the “it was supposed to be <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Tinker’s</FONT> run…” excuse to nullify the “hare can’t get the 
Hashit” rule. (There are NO RULEs, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>!)<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The food and the 
beer were then served. <FONT color=#ff0000>Dr WHO</FONT> had brought a choice of 
movies for the birthday girl; one, being in PAL format, would not play on <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT> antiquated DVD player. (<FONT 
color=#ff0000>Snotty</FONT> snapped that one up, I can tell you. So, they were 
forced to watch the 1975 film “Abigail Leslie is Back in Town”, an 
underappreciated classic if ever there was one. Another Monday night in 
paradise!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
