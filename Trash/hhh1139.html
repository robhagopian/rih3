<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">For the 
traditional Burn’s event, many wore kilts (<font color="#ff0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>, and the hare). But many didn’t (for <font color="#ff0000">Donkey</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Pubic</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> and <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font>, possibly 
ignorance could be an excuse. But <font color="#ff0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> ? For shame!). The run was on the East Side, 
hared by Oozing. As such, it was pathetic, and pavement-filled. At least there 
were both Scotch and beer stops. But then, again…<br>     
             
            
               
             
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Starting from the Ivy Tavern, the 
trail left all Hope behind (ha, ha!) and went down 3<sup>rd</sup> St to Lorimer. Without much challenge, trail 
was followed down towards the river and Blackstone Blvd. The only impetus to run 
was to get going before Basket showed up, as he’d been running late, and was 
reportedly on his way. Trail briefly touched on the Boulevard, and as expected, 
jumped the wall into Swan Point Cemetery. Many had not bothered with flashlights 
(they know WHO they were!), and ended up stumbling along behind <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> as they led through the cemetery. They ran 
past the Lippitt family vaults and down to an overgrown path along the river. 
There was actually some shiggy. Some actually managed to slip on the steep, 
leave-covered slopes. There were some branch-to-the-face events. But these good 
times were not to last.<br>         
              
             
          
    <br>    
            
                
              
             
             
               
              
            
            
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Trail led 
back up to the north end of the cemetery. It was pretty obvious that it would 
lead to the north entrance by Alfred Stone Road. And in fact, this is where the 
Whiskey Check was found. The group gathered and passed around the bottle. Just 
as the songs were about to get going, they saw lights. The Police! Running and 
hiding have not served us well in the past. But discretion is not without 
merits. Most moved out of the cemetery property (only a few yards away), and 
declined to run further. And then, they spotted a second light! The two lights 
converged! What was going on!!<br>       
               
               
              
              
               
              
              
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I’ll leave 
the details to your imagination. Suffice it to say, the Cemetery Security Patrol 
had caught up with <font color="#ff0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>, in kilt and tam. 
For reasons only known to God and <font color="#ff0000">Basket’s</font> 
conscience, they let him go and he joined the group. I’m not making any 
accusations, but there ARE a lot of gay men roaming the East Side at night. And 
<font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> wears nothing ‘neath his kilt. That’s all I’m 
saying!<br><br>      
             
               
              
                
         </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">With his arrival, the joy of 
course left the run. Most tried to flee on Alfred Stone. But the hare pleaded 
that they follow trail. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> gave in and continued in the woods back west 
to Blackstone, leading the group through the last little bit of contrived 
shiggy. Trail crossed Lippitt Park 
(leading to some interesting sightings of men in kilts on see-saws). Hope Street 
was followed south to about 4<sup>th</sup>, and they turned west heading for 
Summit and Camp Street. Somewhere just at the edge of the worst neighborhood on 
the East Side, they finally found the Beer Check, at <font color="#ff0000">Just 
Anna’s</font> brother’s house. They had a beer check, 
had a few songs, and then, the crowning injustice, the hare declared it time to 
circle up. Pathetic! <br><br>There was an appreciative 
audience of small children, supervised by <font color="#ff0000">Just Anna</font> 
(looking much like a small child herself in her cuddly little PJs). This may 
have contributed to the brevity and cavity of the circle. The run was rated. 
Some consideration was given the hare for routing the run on streets as kilts 
are meant to be seen. But the pavement, the lack of <font color="#ff0000">Basket’s</font> arrest, the combination BC/Circle and the 
contrived shiggy could only mean one thing: -0! Hashit? To <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>, of course, 
for not getting arrested.<br>      <br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The circle was closed, and they returned 
up the hill to the Ivy Tavern. The group could not sit in one spot in this 
hole-in-the-wall, so they broke up into several tables, distributing the 
annoying smells and behavior evenly throughout the establishment. Basket brought 
out the haggis. All were served as much as they could want, and <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> showed up just in time to have his share. 
Surprisingly, most of the non-hashers in the place started asking for their 
checks. Another fine evening wasted.</p>
