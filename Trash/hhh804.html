<p>Things were looking sorry when 6:30 rolled around. The first Monday in
October, a convenient location, but no <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
to join the pack. The famous FRBs were absent from the Hash, meaning that we
would have to run the checks ourselves. That running skill, which would be
looked down upon by other hashes, has a vital role here in RI, allowing the pack
to cruise along comfortably. However, after running along with <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font>, I now know why that pair stay at the front, far from the maddening
woman.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Shine On, Dr WHO, <u>Everready</u>, Enema Bill (LAM),
PW, Bodhisattva Bondo</font> and a foul smell joined <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
the hare on the docks. After an <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill</font> inspired
wait for the missing FRBs, the pack was off to explore old railroad tracks, and
hazardous soil on the Portuguese banks of the Blackstone.&nbsp; A check at the
end of the tracks sent <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill</font> off to explore
some rusting oil tanks, and sent the pack on to some peace and quiet. A minor
circle jerk led onto the Red Bridge for the trek to the City of Cianci.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> set trail for the pack to wander aimlessly
in the woods along the Blackstone, through the darkness to the rear of the
Wheeler school. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>and <font color="#FF0000">PW
</font>searched for the suddenly missing flour trail. Meanwhile <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill LAM</font>, confronted by a large well lit building facing out onto a
wooded area well known for illicit homosexual activity and frequent police
patrols, began blowing on his horn like a champ, and ran to the front of the
building, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>The Hash rejoiced!</p>
<p>The Great Flour Search yielded a grinning hare on the far side of an empty 6
foot deep drainage channel. This impenetrable dog barrier kept up <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>’
streak of setting trail designed to be unfriendly to our 4 footed management.
After much swearing <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>
lifted the H3 management across the canal, while<font color="#FF0000"> Shine On</font>
swore and began humping a log that had been set across that concrete chasm.
&quot; Don’t fuck with me&quot; she screamed at first<font color="#FF0000"> PW</font>,
then the Hare, while she went about her business.</p>
<p>The dogless <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> ran ahead of the pack to a
rapid rise from a check. The trail leading out to an &quot;alternative
lifestyle&quot; woods, outfitted with condom dispensers and a wonderful pink
sequin number. Oh wait, that was the Hare and his new walking stick.</p>
<p>On through the woods, out to the Boulevard of Broken Zippers down the banks
to the swollen</font> <font SIZE="2">BlackStone. And the river too. Near Beer
was called, and the pack scrambled over another high wall to catch a trail that
had been swallowed up by high tide. Another ferrying of dogs, finishing just in
time to see the Hare move into the tidal swamp, and go down to his neck in the
debris and shit, followed close behind by the H3 sawbones <font color="#FF0000">Dr
WHO</font>.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2"><font color="#FF0000">Bondo, PW, Eveready </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> were having none of that, and sought the out trail (which has a
different meaning in this part of town) to the beer stop. The Hare, clever
bastard that he is, also put the out trail leading to a stone wall with an 8
foot vertical drop. What could have been beer stop of the year, one without <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill LAM,</font> was not to be because the hare made its location inaccessible.
Another wise move.</p>
<p>In the words of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo,</font> &quot; Fuck This&quot;.</p>
<p>The Bodhisattva and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>, immediately recognizing
their surroundings, decided to split up, and seek cover in the company of ladies
with two legs or four. <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> began the run back with <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font>
and Zoe,<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> with the 3 pooches, Jake, Ben and
Shine On. The run back was marked by the sight of 2 men kissing in a car. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> finally found.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>
remained behind, drinking beer in the woods off of a known homosexual area.
Alone, in the woods. Behind.</p>
<p>On back across the Red Bridge to the start, where, to everyone’s chagrin, <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill</font> was waiting at the cars, and some sorry ass story about running
around the Wheeler school sober and with his pants on. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> were never found, leading to wild rumors
about Pakistan and the influence of last week's hash trash upon those two
impressionable minds.</p>
<p>Eveready saved the day with a hidden six pack in the trunk of the car. A true
hasher. The Hare and <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who </font>came jogging along
about 20 minutes later, each with a wide smile on his face. (Hey Norton, I been
looking at you….)</p>
<p>Down downs were given to the hare. <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill LAM</font>
then tried to engineer a coup by falsely claiming <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font>
was not her true name. Another sign of the old fart’s dementia setting in,
this was swiftly knocked away by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>,
backing the claims of our fine new addition. As George Wallace said</p>
<b>
<p>Eveready it was,</p>
<p>Eveready it is now,</p>
<p>Eveready it shall be.</b></p>
<p>The Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font>, just because it’s
her first run after being named. It also means the residents of 290 Snake Hill
Rd will be squatting over the porcelain for the next 7 days. <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> provided the final moment of jubilation by announcing that because of
her new job, she could not join the RIH3 every Monday. Spontaneous dancing and
singing erupted along the docks, yielding only to discussion of how this one
event could spur a new recruiting drive. <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> pointed
out that her new salary would be diverted to covering the outrageous Boston H3
hash fees. Pseudo hashers. Poseurs</p>
<p>All except<font color="#FF0000"> PW</font> moved to the Redbridge tavern for
free buffet and lots of Portagee men staring blankly at Monday Night Football.
After being fortified by strong beer and chorizo, <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill</font> attempted to start a rousing rendition of &quot; Wee ide ide&quot;
followed by a song about female anatomy. This siren call brought the boys back
to their inner selves,<font color="#FF0000"> Dr Who</font> singing chorus, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>attempting to place food in his mouth while complaining about the
temperature of the beer.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> giggled uncontrollably, while <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font>
pondered why two older men with wives and children would have such a fascination
with female genitalia. Then she remembered that &quot; Cosmopolitan&quot;
article from last summer about erectile dysfunction and it all made sense.</p>
