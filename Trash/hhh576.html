<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The setting was in East Greenwich with directions
being absolutely perfect, any complainers should take their cars to the
dealer for an mileometer check, a hot evening with expectations running
high for the attendees which included </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
Boom Boom, Beyond Hope, Async, Oozing, Bondo, Jake, Shine On</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
(Boston), a new boot Frank and yours truly. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The run set off with the first check outwitting
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> (not difficult),
soon to follow onto some new trail for the RIH3. For once hardly anybody
guessed the right trail on many of the early checks. The trail led onto
tarmac with everybody except our Bimbo and new boot taking the right hand
check. Soon followed by another check which </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
almost got right but got frightened away by a small dog-whimp. The true
trail led up through a small holding to a check which this time </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
got right. Onto again new trail for about a mile or so before coming up
to a housing estate where unless you were in the mob or were a drug dealer
you could not afford to live in this particular area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finally hitting the beer check with fine beer
on hand which we very nearly could not find. Our Master of ceremonies </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was in fine voice with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine On</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
giving her own female rendition having orgasms as she went. After listening
to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine On</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s
voice perhaps a more appropriate name would be “Strangled Cat with a Dildo
up it’s rear end”. The on out up the thorny hill was difficult to find
due to the singing of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine On</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
putting my ears out of balance. However we eventually came back on track
with a large check again fooling the pack before leading through an overgrown
field.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The final part of this run was in honor of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
after leaving me to drown in the North Smithfield bog, this is the best
shiggy East Greenwich has to offer and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
did actually get up to his knees in shit and I believe everybody had different
color running shoes by the time the vehicles were reached. Overall I would
say a great run which kept the whole pack together, but there again I am
slightly biased.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The circle up and On-On was held this week in
my pool, with outstanding marks given for the quality of the run with a
mark of 6.9 x 10 to the minus 69. New boots Frank fitted in quite well
not being able to answer the three standard questions at first attempt,
but wanted to come back for another try. Hashshit award was finally taken
away from </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
in a flood of tears and after releasing his grip on the worshipped bag
it was awarded to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
for perpetual whining. The Hashshit did actually make the pool go a funny
color or was it everybody taking a piss? On-On was the Mrs. Snot curry
which is now famous on the RIH3 circuit, we hope the red rings were burning
next day for those of you that had the hot stuff! Beer as always good with
contributions from Bondo’s home brew-many thanks. Another East Greenwich
success and I believe a good time had by all. </FONT></P>
