The Ass Quack & The Rusty Irishman<br/><br/>

In a big nest, tucked behind a larger nest, on the huge Island of Portsmouth lived an Ass Quack with his wife, Crabby Shag. They were very unhappy. Every time Ass Quack laid flower on Monday, a Rusty Irishman who lived in a clover patch 4 miles down the street, would scoop up the flower, bake a massive biscuit and eat it. After yet another frustrating trail with no flower Ass Quack had a circle wank with a few Hashers including, Who, Basket Boom Boom, Whipos, Sgt. Jizz in My Pants, Oozing, & Shameless Cussy the visitor. While wanking, Ass Quack shared his misery. "I feel so hopelessâ€¦.That sneaking Irish thief has eaten our flower again," complained Ass Quack angrily.<br/><br/>

"Don't worry," said Boom Boom comfortingly. "You need not be hopeless when you have a friend like me. We will come up with a solution."<br/><br/>

The Boom Boom sat and wanked to think of a plan. Suddenly he jumped up and rushed to the other side of the circle to Ass Quack.<br/><br/>

"Wanker, I have a wonderful plan," said Boom Boom and whispered something into the Ass Quack's ear.<br/><br/>

Ass Quack flew back to his nest and told Crabby all about the Boom Booms plan. He was very excited.
<br/><br/>
"Are you sure this will work?" asked Crabby.
<br/><br/>
"I hope we are not making a mistake. Think twice before going ahead with the plan."
<br/><br/>
But Ass Quack was eager to try out the plan. Ass Quack flew down to the local package store. He bought several cases of Captains Daughter IPA and multiple bags of Orange Food. With the IPA and Orange Food and went over the bridge to the mainland to a dumpster behind a whore house in which a Shemale lived. He dropped a cracked open IPA in front of the dumpster. Then he took a bag of Orange Food and dropped it a little further away from the first one. Repeating this, he made a trail of IPA's & Orange Food leading over the bridge through the island, past the remaining flower to the hollow where the Rusty Irishman lived.
<br/><br/>
The Shemale smelt the IPA and came out of the dumpster. "Ah, an IPA & Orange Food!" exclaimed the Shemale joyfully and quickly drank and ate it up. He then followed the trail of IPA & Orange Food. As he neared the hollow where the Rusty Irishman lived, the trail of IPA & Orange Food ended. Finding no more Beer or Food, the Shemale started looked around for something else to drink & Eat.
<br/><br/>
Suddenly he came across the Rusty Irishman at the foot of the hollow, full of Whisky and Ten Pound Biscuit's. "That will do!" exclaimed the Shemale, licking its lips. Seeing the Shemale, the Rusty Irishman fought for his life. Both fought for a long time and in the end the Shemale killed and ate the Rusty Irishman. Ass Quack & Crabby who were watching the fight from their nest sighed with relief.
<br/><br/>
The next Monday the shemale began to follow the same trail hoping to find more beer & food. When he came to the Hollow where the trail ended, he decided to look around in search of Beer & food.
<br/><br/>
Ass Quack & Crabby who were out setting trail returned to find the Shemale walking the out trail. On looking at the trail, they discovered that this time, the shemale had scoop up the flower, baked an even larger biscuit and ate it, and on top of it drank all their Beer.
<br/><br/>
"Alas! We got rid of one enemy only to find another," said Ass Quack & Crabby.

 <br/>

The End...
