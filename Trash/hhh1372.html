Hashshit- Basket<br><br>

A large crowd had already assembled at the poor Doctor's humble abode. The primary driveway was almost full, the car port was packed with cars, and the second drive had a few more cars and a long live-in trailer Construction had been underway for a few year, with painting, new roof, upgrading of the help cottage, and a new heliport.<br><br>

Beer had already been supplied, as WHO had to set out early to relay the trail after thunderstorms ran through the area. Hole Miner's Daughter was the perfect hostess, offering snacks and beer while we were introduced to the visitors. The two TT Hashers sold their belongings and bought the trailer to see the Hash world. Stopping in RI for this leg of their journey, they were pleased to meet Basket and the rest of the RIH3. There was some thinking to just blow off the Hash and enjoy the Hare's beer and goodies, but eventually HMD thought daddy would think less of her, so we pressed out on trail.<br><br>

Trail started out easterly and went clockwise around Creamer Pond and out onto pavement following Sakonnet Ridge Drive and Church Pond Drive. A good check had us confused. Anytime a Hare has to lower himself by so much pavement it shows how desperate one can get. <br><br>

Eventually we went east again into the woods along some off-road vehicle trails. Shemale and Wee Balls were taking their time chatting and just as I passed them Crotch Tiger twisted her ankle and they stopped to attend to her. At the next check, I ran right with the male TT Hasher and his dog, while the pack went left. Eventually he turned back and I didn't see anyone for the next 30-40 minutes.<br><br>

I was sure the beer stop would be at the rocky overlook on Rte 24, so I followed trail that had no flour. It's more than a bit sad that this Hare didn't have the decency to put flour along the trail, but I suppose it does get a bit expensive to be hare and one may have to skimp<br><br>

I arrived at the overlook and waited for the pack. It was so quiet, that I thought they might be lost, so eventually I bushwhacked back downhill and found a check marked in the opposite direction...go figure. Out on the road again and found flour heading down towards the bridge construction. At the next check, found the DFL's wondering aimlessly. Running ahead, I found flour and called them on. I continued along the water towards the Boat House Restaurant and then out to a point where I could see a back of lowlifes out in the water drinking beer. It would be another 10 minutes before I found the right trail and a cold one.<br><br>

Eventually all arrived, including our eternal late-cumer WIPOS, and beers were enjoyed, along with hot nuts and much rejoicing.<br><br>

The beer finished, the Hare led us along the water's edge and thigh to waist water. It was mostly pleasant except where the sewage overflow pipe offered a different odoriferous color to, what was mostly, a white bread trail.<br><br>

Back at WHO's the circle was formed in the eastern field, just past the gazebo near the lake. DD's were given to the Hare, his non-co-hare, visitors, virgins, and others for various offenses. As it was getting dark and concerned his neighbors would protest the large gathering behind his house, WHO suggested we wrap it up and order pizza. We were soon relaxing near the Carriage House enjoying the luxury of the doctors good fortune. When the food and beer was gone, we went back to our homes and another Hash was in the books.
