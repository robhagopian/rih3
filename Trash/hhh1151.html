set in Massachusetts, by a hare unable to come up with anything original in RI. 
What’s next? A trail in the Northeast Kingdom? The usual crowd gathered in a 
dirt parking lot on the west side of Everett Skinner Rd. in North Plainville. At 
6:30 promptly, they began. <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>, at a walk, went his own way as 
usual, and will not be heard from again in this write-up. Count your 
blessings.<br>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail led east 
across the roads, and at the first check, turned south. <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> continued east. Unfortunately, we WILL hear from HIM 
again! Even though he entered a shooting range, he did not manage to get hit. 
They need more practice apparently. Led by <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font>, they 
came to some playing fields. Trail crossed back to the west side of the road and 
then turned north. For a while, it was manicured trail. A river crossing even 
had a sturdy bridge. So no one was in the least wet.  <br>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Finally trail became rougher. There was 
some swamp. But it turned back east, north of the cars. It led parallel to the 
road, with the road in sight at all times. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> stayed on trail. The rest took the road. The 
hare was seen ahead, sitting by his car. Hope for a beer check was soon dashed 
as he sent them back into the woods, back on the east side again, entering north 
of Cowell St.<br>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">A series of 
annoying checks now followed. Trail led in a semi-circle east then north then 
west. There was no challenge to it, except to rail at the hare for combining two 
full-length trails into one! The word “interminable” comes to mind. Or 
“deathmarch”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, trail led back out to Everett 
Skinner Road. It crossed again, and just in the shadow of Rt 495, a “BN” was 
seen. And it was pretty obvious where to go. There was a 48” culvert with a 
trickle of water coming out that clearly went under the highway. So off they 
went.<br>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The BC was found 
on the north side of 495. As they settled in, they also found a very educational 
magazine. This was carefully examined, limiting the amount of singing at the BC. 
<font color="#ff0000">Eenie Weenie</font> claimed to know some of the girls. <font color="#ff0000">Dr WHO</font> was impressed with some of the contortions those 
girls could get themselves into. <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> took notes. 
<font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> was disappointed that there were no photos of 
young men. And the ads for movies!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

</span>(coming soon to a hash near you?) (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840313/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840313/</a>) is clearly a 
classic. (This can be assumed because the public demanded that “Destination: 
Dirtpipe 2” be made the very same year, 2006! Obviously, this series 
represents a crowning achievement for director William H. Nutsack. Hashname? But 
I digress.)<br>

was on the road. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The circle was 
joined and the run rated. Some shiggy, a fine dirt pipe crawl, and loss of <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> clearly outweighed the unnecessary length of trail. 
Total:+0.69. Hashit: <font color="#ff0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>. Why? <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> knows! So, finishing up, they decided to try 
their luck at Champions. Fortunately, they were not remembered, and after 
eating, the evening came to a bland and unmemorable end.<br>
