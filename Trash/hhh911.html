<p>Summary for Run #911, Sept, 29, 2003</p>
<p>(by Dr. Who)<br><br><br>
Run #911 (How appropriate!) Sept 29,2003<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hares:</font> Deep Throat, Just Jeff, and EverReady (in spirit)<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Scribe: </font>Async<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Ocean State Job Lot, Pawtucket.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> 60's, Clear<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Bondo Jovi, Dr WHO, BirdBrain, WIPOS, Fuwangi Boner, Basket Boom Boom, Oozing SD, 
SESYB, Swallows My Pride, Mother Goose; Visitors: Doofus White Boy or something- Gainesville H3, Friar F*ck-Boston H3
<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>No marks at first, prompting <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> to Call the &quot;Mystery Hare&quot; DT and then 
send the pack east to a nearly pobliterated Check mark in some grass. Things deteriorated from there, as the trail weaved 
drunkenly with few marks over to East Ave, Blackstone Blvd going south, over to Elmgrove, back east across the Blvd into 
the well used woods south of Butler Hospital for the first shiggy in miles of pointless running. Most of the pack declined 
the shiggy, catching sight of auto-haring wankers leaving Butler back north on the Blvd. Those who followed trail went east 
and slightly north through briars and poison ivy to a stream bed, through (or over) a nice tunnel in the muck to come out 
near the inpatient portion of the Insane Asylum (again, how appropriate!). The security guards provided a courteous and 
helpful escort out, and trail led up the Blvd to enter Swan Point Cemetery on the path to the north boundary road and 
thence to the Beer Check near the Alfred Drown Road entrance. Beer: Guiness, Honey Brown Ale and some horse urine from a 
Giant Beer can with Grolsch or something written on it. On-out in groups looking for <font color="#FF0000">SMP</font> and 
Mother Goose in various ways, back to OSJL, and thence to on-after at co-hare's house down a side street.<br>
Ratings: 6.9<br>
Hashit:<font color="#FF0000"> Dr WHO </font>(for invading the nether regions of <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> Colon 
the previous week. Obviously, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> SHOULD have received the award. He was the recipient of 
the colonoscopy, after all.)<br>
Food: Burnt SESYB Burgers and Striped Bass, Corn and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>-style couscous.<br>
