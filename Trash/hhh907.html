<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><i>[There are a million stories in the naked city (Glendale). These are just a few from the files of the RIH3. The names 
have been changed to protect the innocent and because I can’t keep track of them. Oh sure, and I’m supposed to not drink at 
a hash, right! And <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> even had MGD (not quite Bud, but what an improvement over the 
usual!) If you don’t like it, do your own freakin’ write-up, dammit!]</i></p>

<p>The hare screwed things up right from the beginning. He gave accurate d’erections which allowed a crew of Boston and 
Newport wankers to find their way to the start eventually (and messed up most of the RIH3 regulars who assembled at the 
Burrillville Middle School by mistake). And then he took things further by not making it to the start himself by the strict 
RIH3 2 PM start time. This is measured by the geosynchronous 1.5 lb. Atomic Clock that <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
wears on his wrist. (Actually, we think he wears that so’s he gets a little more aerobic exercise when he wanks, but we 
don’t know for sure.) Promptly at 2 then, the on-time arrivals: <font color="#FF0000">WHO, Bird Brain,</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> led a crew of <font color="#FF0000">Mrs. Robinson, Shine On, Evil B*tch RIPTA, Muffalotta, 
</font>and a few other suckers off into the woods east behind the tennis courts. Ok. Lost again. Following <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>!! (You’d think they’d know by now, the trail always starts behind the freakin’ hockey rink. 
What morons!) Against all odds, they still found true trail west. Behind the freakin’ hockey rink. Duh! And, before the 
hare and the rest of the latecummers arrived. They went off into the woods and began to frolic in the totally misnamed 
Clear River. (I could go on forever about the ecologifical imprecations about this freakin’ body of ‘water’. But I depress.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the start, the hare arrived along with <font color="#FF0000">Async, Oozing, Bondo, SESYB</font>, 
myself and a bunch of other losers<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in the second wave. (You know who you are!) The hare gave 
some instructions (and snuck some flour and chalk to his secret co-hare <font color="#FF0000">Periodic Table Dancer</font>, 
so’s she could really screw things up, I bet!). They finally started out after the lead pack, which by this time had 
separated into two: a group milling about aimlessly by a fence separating them from the Burrillville Landfill, and 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Mrs Robinson</font>, who had crossed the river and were 
intimately exploring their common interests in some really excellent shiggy leading back to Whipple Road. The water had a 
brown foul-smelling algae characteristic of high level coliform seepage. And the rain was coming down pretty good, by now. 
I bet you wanks who didn’t show up are pretty envious at this point, aren’t you!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in East Providence, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> said to his wife: “Oh, I don’t miss hashing at all! 
I’d much rather stay here and chastise my teenaged daughter while I help you organize your tea-cozies.” And <font 
color="#FF0000">PW</font>, in Cranston, said: “Oh, I wish those wankers would let me hare , for once! I’m such a great 
hare. For cryin’ out loud!”</p>

<p>And, up in Boston, <font color="#FF0000">Cream Whora, Puff-‘n-Stuff</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Anal Avenger
</font> were taking a field trip to Drumlin Farm for the annual Sheep-Shaggin’ Jamboree. O, I don’t think I want to 
describe any more, thank you very much!</p>

<p>Well by now the second wave caught up with the first, led by me of course, thanks to my excellent woodcraft and almost 
uncanny skill on trail. Most of us made it out to Whipple Road at various points of egress from the woods (as my freakin’ 
PChem teacher would say). But <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had local knowledge and hopped the fence into the 
landfill. Even <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> was too smart to follow him for long, so in a short time, he was alone 
with his compost. And no easy freakin’ egress for him, I can tell you! Just the way he likes it. And we like it too, when 
he’s away, I mean!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the start, a whole bunch of wankers from Newport showed up. I guess the bowling alleys were closed 
for the holidays or something. I think <font color="#FF0000">APC, Lil’ Debbie </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Radioactive 
Semen</font> were some of their names, but who can keep track. (I mean they live in freakin’ Newport for cryin’ out loud. 
That’s even farther from Connecticut than Rhode Island is, I think! And now that I live in Massachusets (it always takes me 
a while to learn the spelling when I move to a new state), forget it! I think they’re like three or four states away from 
me.) They went to work right away. I heard they like tried to set up a temporary bowling alley in the Nipmuc Village 
Longhouse behind the school, but I could be wrong. Anyways, they delayed long enough to be sure that they missed the beer 
check.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Mrs. Robinson</font> had reluctantly burst 
through the muck, jewelweed and poison ivy and were running back and forth on Whipple Road, trying to catch scent or sound 
of the pack. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was exploring a gas pocket on the hillside of the landfill with a 
cigarette lighter. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>was trying to control his crippled dog, who was only trying to turn 
his master to the true trail, for cryin’ out loud! <font color="#FF0000">Periodic Table Dancer </font>was putting “X”s all 
over the place to ensure complete confusion for the followers. This was getting good.</p>

<p>I, of course was in charge of my group and led south on Whipple under 102 to a check which led back into the woods 
northeast on a railroad grade, and crossed the Victory Highway on Mill Street. A “SC” led into the mill pond and was 
tempting, but I saw that the hare had somehow acquired a yellow bag with cups and jugs. No way was I letting him out of my 
sight.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Mrs. Robinson </font>showed up, finally set on the right 
trail by some Uncle Jed and Granny-types who were re-shingling their porch on Whipple. They discovered a “No Trespassing” 
sign. That’s like a red flag to a bull for these guys. Off again into some woods. A mill surviving only as a foundation and 
a single wall was encountered. Trail was followed upstream in the Branch River to the dam. (This water had unusual 
fluorescent green algae suggestive of the results seen in early experiments with atomic weapons in the 50’s. But at least 
it didn’t smell so bad.) On the opposite side <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and a few others were milling about at the 
destitute beer check. The hare was closely tailed now by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and me. We may be slow, but we’re 
dumb. We came up to the beer check. It was immediately apparent that the hare had planned for the usual RIH3 attendance of 
4 or 5, and didn’t have enough beer to even raise a fart from the average hasher. What a wank!</p>

<p>Luckily, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> chose this moment to go downstream rather than up. <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> was still trying to force his dog to go over to St Teresa’s.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>found out 
what happens when you examine a gas pocket in a landfill with a cigarette lighter. The Newporters encountered mud. They had 
never seen this before, on the well-paved Aquidneck Island. They should get out more. They spent some time trying to 
analyze it. They found it didn’t work very well for bowling. By the time they decided to move on, everyone had already left 
the beer check.</p>

<p>OK then. We left the BC finally, because <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>arrived. We headed northeast along the 
river, led by me, of course. The trail was mostly deer-path and some overgrown trails and if the freakin’ water table had 
been normal, there would have been some fine shiggy, I can tell you. This freakin’ drought is really starting to piss me 
off. But just about everyone knew that the hare’s house was due east, so no one was about to miss the right turn. The pack 
came out through a woman’s yard. She watched from the window and says: “I thought you guys were supposed to be running?” 
What does <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tell his freakin’ neighbors, anyways? Is he trying to convince them he’s like 
an athlete or something? Keerist!</p>

<p>Well, we straggled up to the infamous 290 Snake Hill, in a nice drizzle, to find a fine collection of dry wankers and 
auto-hashers warm in the kitchen, eating all our freakin’ food. (And it had to be the big boys too. <font color="#FF0000">
Friar F*ck, Free Willy</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, they can sure put away the chow, dammit. If <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>’d been there, there wouldn’t have been a scrap left for 
the pack for sure!) Over the next half-hour most of the crew checked in, and the hare, anxious to avoid his just desserts, 
called the circle to order.</p>

<p>Well, that’s an exaggeration. The hare had no control whatsoever, and if it hadn’t been for the sheep-like behaviour of
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain</font> and 
the Boston Wanks, no one would have paid any attention to the hare. But they did and they gathered. Ratings for the run 
were interrupted by freakin’ latecomers, arriving against all odds.&nbsp; Overall, the ratings would have been horrendous. 
What a freakin’ recycle job! But it had rained. There were rivers crossed. There was mud. There were no bowling venues. 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Oozing</font> and<font color="#FF0000"> Fuwangi </font>had missed beer at the beer check. 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> was still lost, despite no less than three expeditions to go out and find him. Hooray! 
Run of the week! Score: 6.9!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> weak from lack of beer, staggered hopelessly through the woods, a sense 
of impending doom, of a hovering evil, of the end of all sensibility. But he found a half-smoked Marlboro in the crotch of 
a poison-ivy bush, lit it and regained his optimism. He somehow knew he would get back! As God was his witness, HE WOULD 
GET BACK!&nbsp; (And in fact he DID get back finally, although by that time, we all had lost interest and were not about to 
let him cut in on the lines to get the little food that was left, I can tell you!)</p>

<p>Hashit went through the usual convoluted sequences, and was given by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> variously to 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Async,</font> and <font color="#FF0000">At Your Cervix</font> (for actually requesting the 
sight of <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> Ring. Twice!! O, the horror!), but was ultimately given by universal acclaim 
to<font color="#FF0000"> Fuwangi.</font> He promptly jumped into the pool. Another Hashit down the tubes!</p>

<p>As I said the ceremony was out of control. So, ultimately when it was declared over, and we Swung Low, everyone breathed 
a sigh of relief. Finally, we could eat. Finally, we could wear adult incontinence diapers and have a competition to see 
who could fill them the best. Finally <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> could get naked and jump in the pool Finally 
we had a chance to compare breasts: Boston v. Newport, with Rhode Island declining because Bondo had a bit of a chill and 
didn’t want to take his top off! Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> put his clothes back on! Finally, I could 
make my excuses and head back to Marlboro MA and hit the Marlboro House O’ Pizza and get myself a large with extra cheese 
and a pitcher of Bud. Hey, it’s not Mark’s, but it’s home for me now.</p>
