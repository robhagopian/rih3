<p>This is a tale of wickedness 
and foul sorcery. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, 
signifying nothing.&nbsp; A tale of a hash to celebrate All Hallows Eve, three full 
days early at the Feast of St. Jude (Patron of Lost Causes).&nbsp; The regulars 
gathered at the Oakhill Tavern, at Dunsinane Hill south of Wickford, near the 
witching hour of 6:30 in a cold and dark night. Their dress reflected the unholy 
nature of their gathering. Bewigged, begown’d, be-ukuleled and benighted they 
met at the dark void of the parking area. Truck drivers pulling in to take 
advantage of the tavern’s fare looked askance at the group. One said: &quot;What are 
these so wither'd and so wild in their attire, that look not like the 
inhabitants of th' earth and yet are on 't?&quot; God alone knew.</p>

<p>The hare in black and gold, the cohare with platinum locks called the hashers to order and said:</p>

<p>“Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,<br>
Witches' mummy, maw and gulf<br>
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,<br>
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,</p>

<p>Liver of blaspheming Jew,<br>
Gall of goat, and slips of yew<br>
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,<br>
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,<br>
Finger of birth-strangled babe<br>
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,</p>

<p>‘Tis come upon your final hour<br>
You’ll be lucky if you find flour<br>
Gnash your teeth, and weep and wail<br>
It will not help you find the trail!<br>
Turn north then mark west 'tis showing,<br>
And stand not upon the order of your going,<br>
But go at once.<br>
If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.”<br>
The hares stood, cold and merciless.</p>

<p>Bondo said: &quot;Come all you 
spirits that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here.” Dr WHO replied: “Fill me, 
from the crown to th' toe, top-full of direst cruelty; make thick my blood!” 
WIPOS rejoined: “Stop up the access and passage to remorse, that no compunctious 
visitings of nature shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between the effect and 
it.” The hares sneered. This was too much. EverReady shook her head, saying: 
“Come to my woman's breasts, and take my milk for gall, you murthering 
ministers, wherever in your sightless substances you wait on nature's mischief.” 
KNO adjusted his/her brassiere, saying: &quot;I hope you bastards didn't put the Beer 
Check too far from here.&quot; The hares laughed, a cold sound without mercy. And 
then they were off.</p>

<p>Trail did indeed lead north on Rt 1 briefly, then left into a 
neighborhood where numerous checks had the hashers sore perplexed. Quoth Oozing: 
“ Ah Basket! I grant him bloody, luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, 
sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin that has a name.” PW replied: “ Do you 
doubt the deceit of the hares? Away, and mock the time with fairest show; false 
flour must hide what the false heart doth know.” Bondo said: &quot;F*ck this!&quot; 
Finally, flour was found leading west then south into the dark forests of Birnam 
Wood.</p>

<p>A short distance along the 
banks of Belleville Pond were traversed with Oozing in the lead and Dr WHO and 
PW following. They came upon the origins of the Annaquatucket River. PW looked 
at the crossing and said: “Is this a fish-ladder that I see before me, the 
handle toward my hand? Come, let me cross thee! I have thee not and yet I see 
thee still.” The hare said: &quot;Be thou like the anadromous fish, if thou wouldst 
find the Alewife and/or reach the beercheck.&quot;&nbsp; Dr WHO passed him through the 
water, saying: “PW! Wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting “I 
dare not” wait upon “I would,” like the poor cat I’ th’ adage?” Bondo said: 
&quot;This hare's a f*ckin' a**hole!&quot; They crossed the raging waters as the others 
caught up, much to their regret.</p>

<p>Trail led west, with many a 
false pass undoing our band of hashers as they crossed between Belleville Pond 
and Secret Lake. To Ryan Park they ran. A Field Hockey match was in progress, 
with fourteen year old Valkyries in mortal combat engaged. But not all. For two 
had crept beyond the fields, by a bridge, perchance to partake of the fruit of 
the hop, the barley or of the insane root/weed. They sat in the wood carefree. 
But suddenly, like the rugged Russian bear, the arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan 
tiger, Oozing ran to their hiding place. The sight of an obvious relative of 
Osama Bin Laden, dressed in a Catholic schoolgirl's skirt, with a headlamp had 
them in terror. One said: &quot;Were such things here as we do speak about? Or have 
we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner?&quot; The other said: &quot; 
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Or art thou but a 
hasher of the mind, a false creation proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?&quot;&nbsp; 
Oozing replied: &quot;More will follow. Be lion-mettled, proud and take no care. This 
hash shall not be over until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill shall come 
against the hares.&quot;</p>

<p>The dread trail led west then, 
and with many falsies turned north on a gas pipeline parallel to Route 4. Oozing 
led, with cries of: &quot;On On! And damn'd be him that first cries &quot;Hold, enough!&quot; 
On they went, the night dark and dank around them. A light fog formed. In the 
rearguard, EverReady and KNO felt great foreboding. KNO said: &quot;Fair is foul, and 
foul is fair. We hover through the fog and filthy air!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Do not despair,&quot; said 
EverReady. &quot; Come, thick night! And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, that 
my keen torch see not the flour it shows, nor heav'n peep through the blanket of 
the dark, to cry, On On!&quot;&nbsp; Bondo cried: Ben, you f*ckin' sh*thead! Stop humpin' 
Jake!&quot;</p>

<p>Soon a falsie led Oozing fair 
astray and the Slasher took the traces around the head of Belleville Pond to 
encounter a circle with a &quot;BN&quot;! &quot;O,&quot; quoth Dr WHO, &quot;my plenteous joys, wanton in 
fulness, seek to hide themselves in drops of beer!&quot; He encountered a woman, the 
landowner, the host of the BC, a cobbler who was ill prepared for the sight of a 
220lb man in a white nightie. &quot;Avaunt and quit my sight!&quot; she said. &quot;Let the 
earth hide thee! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; thou hast no 
speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with!&quot; &quot;O, excuse me!&quot; said Dr 
WHO. The other hashers arrived in pairs and alone. The hostess looked puzzled at 
Bondo and the crowd and said: &quot;You should be women, and yet your beards forbid 
me to interpret that you are so.&quot; Finally, when KNO came full-breasted from the 
glen, all were present for Trinity IPA from a five-gallon jug in the parking 
area behind a house owned by the rump-fed ronyons of North Kingston.</p>

<p>They drank deep of the barley, 
and made merry with songs of ill repute (and misbegotten harmonies accompanied 
on ukulele by SESYB). The hare astoundingly remained fully clothed. When queried 
about this variance, he said: &quot;Marry, sir, drink may be said to be an 
equivocator with lechery: it makes him and it mars him; it sets him on, and it 
takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and 
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the 
lie, leaves him.&quot; &quot;What the f*ck are you talking about?!&quot; said Bondo. They were 
soon off again.</p>

<p>The trail backtracked briefly, 
and then led north to a plaza with a Wal-Mart. All was chaos from this point on. 
The lead pack of Oozing, Dr WHO and WIPOS milled about in confusion. Said WIPOS: 
&quot; When shall we three meet again, in thunder, lightning, or in rain?&quot;&nbsp; Oozing 
answer'd: &quot; When the hurlyburly's done, when the hash is lost and run.&quot; Finally, 
trail was found leading back to the woods at the left of the Wal-Mart, to an old 
railroad grade, northwest into the dark. The shouts and whistles of the leaders 
were not sufficient, however, and by the time they had reached the Amtrak rails, 
Bondo, PW, EverReady and KNO were far behind. But WHO, Oozing and WIPOS ran onto 
the deadly rails, at the mercy of the hare.</p>

<p>But where was SESYB? She had 
claim'd injury by mountain bike, and sought some sweet oblivious antidote to 
cleanse the stuffed bosom of the perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart. 
Thus she secretly bargained with the cohare to take a ride and to nap in the 
truck going to the second BC. While resting in th' cab she thought she heard a 
voice cry &quot;Sleep no more! The hare does murder sleep.&quot;-the innocent sleep, sleep 
that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care…&quot; Her guilt preyed upon her , but she 
consoled herself, thinking: &quot;That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold. 
I will not fear the hashit 'till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.&quot;</p>

<p>Half led by hare, the lead trio of weird sisters: Oozing, Dr WHO and 
WIPOS turned left, with Ben and Jake also, off the railroad to encounter the 
cohare and SESYB in a truck laden with new-mown hay specially taken from the 
woods of Birnam. Beer was proffered and accepted. The hare said: &quot; Be large in 
mirth; anon we'll drink a measure the table round.&quot; They waited for the rest to 
arrive. In vain. For Bondo, circling aimlessly at Wal-Mart, saw the time 
slipping away. He decided in a trice and advised PW, EverReady and KNO: &quot;Light 
thickens and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood. Now spurs the lated 
traveller apace to gain the timely inn.&quot; He said that he knew the best way back. 
KNO doubted, saying: &quot; Yet do I fear thy nature. It is too full o' th' milk of 
human kindness to catch the nearest way.&quot; They headed back to Dunsinane and the 
Oakhill Tavern the long way, by road, forsaking the beer check ahead.</p>

<p>At the beer check, Basket the 
hare screwed his courage to the sticking place, and decided to retrace and find 
the lost hashers. 'Twas agreed to drive the unholy trio and SESYB to Wal-Mart, 
where the hare could be retrieved, withal after rescuing the wanking DFLs. Off 
he went into the night. Homeowners along his path threw open windows at his 
noise and called out: &quot; What's the business, that such a hideous trumpet calls 
to parley the sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!&quot; But th' hare would not see 
the others again, 'till Birnam wood had come to Dunsinane. He rejoined the 
hayride and they drove on into the black night.</p>

<p>At Oakhill Tavern, the hours 
drew on apace and PW, fearing the approach of the witching hour, drove off, 
vowing: &quot; How is't with me when every hash appals me? To feed were best at home; 
from thence, the sauce is meat to ceremony: hashing were bare without it.&quot; The 
others waited. EverReady spied a movement on the road. &quot;Look toward Birnam,&quot; she 
cried. &quot;Anon methought the wood began to move!&quot; &quot;Liar and slave!&quot; said KNO. &quot;No 
f*cking way!&quot; said Bondo. The moving grove came down the road to reveal the 
hashers hayride, and all debarked to join the circle.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">They moved across a fence into 
a field bearing signs: &quot;Do not feed the horses or hashers!&quot; The hare and cohare 
took the center of the ring, and the hare tried to divert attention, saying:</p>

<p>&quot;O, well done! I commend your pains;<br>
And every one shall share i' the gains:<br>
And now about the caldron sing,<br>
Like elves and fairies in a ring,<br>
Enchanting all that you put in.&quot;</p>

<p>None were tak'n in, for Birnam 
had come indeed to Dunsinane. The ratings that followed reflected the horrors of 
the night, with a total of +0.69 granted only because of the loss of PW and the 
ill-fated second BC. The hashit was nominated and Basket quickly pointed an 
accusing finger at the renegade car-hasher SESYB. &quot;O, Thou canst not say I did 
it. Never shake thy gory locks at me!&quot; said SESYB. But none could gainsay th' 
choice, and she was hashit. She down-downed with good grace, saying: &quot; This 
even-handed justice commends th' ingredience of our poisoned chalice to our own 
lips.&quot; But the cold grew and the scent of the Oakhill steak fry shortened the 
proceedings. They swung low and the circle was closed, the hare intoning:</p>

<p>&quot;On On, brief circle!<br>
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor hasher<br>
That struts and frets his hour upon the shiggy<br>
And then is heard no more.&quot;</p>

<p>Now good digestion wait on 
appetite, and health on both. They moved into the tavern and ate the red meat, 
drank the beer and were cheered. Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, they 
lived, they loved, they hashed, they lost PW. And there would be other Mondays 
for this band. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty hash from 
Monday to Monday to the last syllable of recorded time; and all our yesterdays 
have lighted fools the way to dusty hashes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thou marvell'st at my words, but hold thee still;<br>
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.</p>

<p>On On</p>
