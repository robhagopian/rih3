<font color="#008000">Run #922</font>, Dec 15, 2003<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> WIPOS<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location: </font>Playground on Rt 114, East Providence<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> 30's, Clear<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Async, Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, Oozing SD, 
SESYB</font>. And the damned dogs.<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">The Run: </font></font></p>

<p>First, let's make one thing clear: there was NO RUN. The trail was a clockwise loop, 0.69 miles in length and even 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> could not break a sweat. But the hare's a wank, and if exposure to toxic waste is a 
criterion for a 'good&quot; hash, then this one probably qualified. Trail left the ice covered playing fields east and 
south and bushwhacked through bushes and brambles to the Ten Mile River, which was easily crossed without moistening 
anything (even <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>) a few yards above the flour markings. Trail meandered southward back 
and forth through some marsh and garbage collections, but the hares footprints in the snow led easily to the beer check 
at a cellar foundation filled with rusting appliances and tires. After a few beers from a somewhat bizarre selection of 
the worst that Magic Hat has to offer, the on out trail led west on a gas pipeline to Rt 114, and thence north back to 
the cars. Pathetic. And this makes it sound considerably better than it was.<br>
Circling up was accomplished in a field of ice near the cars.<br><br>
Ratings: -6.9<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hashit:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, for no 
reason whatsoever (except no doubt to hear one of his new and innovative songs).</p>
