<font size="2" face="Arial">Present: Async, Basket BB, Dr WHO Slasher, Tinker,
Altar ED, Shine ON and yours truly the scribe. Virgin:Just Chris.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">We all knew this was going to special when <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
was present 15 minutes ahead of time! The dogs were conspicuously absent, and oh
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> too although no-one seemed to miss HIM.&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was accosted by some out-of-towners who were
inquiring about camping in this lovely (although soon to become godforsaken)
place. And we thought the hash invited some weirdoes!
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Anyway,&nbsp; the hare set us off after explaining
d'erections to the virgin. Once again the hare was dressed for a Himalayan
expedition (Although the plentiful briars soon provided another explanation).
The pack set off towards the lake and maneuvered a check around the lake and
soon into the woods and into shiggy! The true trail now meandered around the
woods, across a field back north and around the lake then after another check
out east into the woods and blah, blah, blah, more woods, road, stinkin' shiggy
under powerlines and east/west/north in the woods. This was one fucking long
trail!&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">We soon entered West Virginia to note that the pack
was split into four: the leaders <font color="#FF0000">Async, Dr WHO </font>and
yours truly; <font color="#FF0000">Altar ED </font>and the virgin; the walker <font color="#FF0000">Tinker
</font>and the rest! In this fashion we came upon <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>and
the BC.
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;After 2 beers,&nbsp; the leaders took off as
it was getting dark! Leaving the hare, the navy men, the doc and tinker, with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Shine ON</font> neither heard nor seen, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Ooze </font>set off into the blazing red sunset under
the power lines, back across the two lovely collections of shiggy and back
westwards towards the start, onto the road and back at the start.&nbsp; Here we
encountered <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Shine</font>
engaged in, er...talk! We waited for the others to show up, then circled in the
cool lake that proved soothing for the wounds.&nbsp; Down downs to the hare, the
virgin and hashit for <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> for enticing a local
to give her a &quot;ride&quot; in his pink Cadillac! ON ON to the 99, after the
hare announced a different bar to send <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>the
wrong way!&nbsp; Doesn't the wanker know the run ends after the circle? A hashit
offence maybe?
