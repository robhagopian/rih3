<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The run started behind a ball park in dismal
Pawtucket. The hare knew this and so expected a small turn out and so he bribed
various family members with a free colonoscopy if they came to the run, and
no-one told <font color="#FF0000">Stuff Me</font> that this wasn't just any
probing in any orifice otherwise she wouldn't have come!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yours truly arrived late but soon heard the pack
in the woods and short-cutted to the lead and into shiggy. Cursing the hare was
the wrong thing to do as everyone managed to skip this nasty part of the trail,
but were they in for a surprise! The trail led west than S/W and west again
(yeah right!) and onto road and a check that took trail across the water on the
other side of the bike path and into woods, onto road and north back into the
woods and into familiar territory and soon onto the rail road tracks. Here a
large snapper was encountered and as <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>
approached it, it smelt something fishy and started snapping. This turned <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> on and after what seemed an eternity she came and the run continued
down the tracks, out left thru woods out by a ball park and behind and into
woods again.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> in lead,
a nasty swamp was encountered where the hare chose his beer-check, so no-one
would steal it! Good beer was had and an attempt at singing with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
missing and the pack made it back towards the start going thru streets and back
into the woods and to the car where Steptoe and son, I mean <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
and son were waiting.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Circle up in the woods, with down-downs to the
hare, visitors and virgin, with the hashit going to <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>
for wearing a competitive running shirt so the police wouldn't notice and having
a conscience! On On at a crappy bar down the road where they welcomed our
singing, except the bartender who was Scottish and didn't take too well to our
version of&nbsp; Scotland the Brave...maybe he was sensitive to all the foot-in-mouth
disease going around! Good time had by all! </font></p>
