color=#000000>Starting from the 
Brown Ave. School, just south of Dame Farm and Snake Den was sort of a new twist 
for ancient territory. Three virgins even managed to make it, and for a while it 
looked hopeful that<FONT color=#ff0000> Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> would not. But, ten minutes late, they pulled in, just 
in time to see the co-hare heading out with a suspicious knapsack.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

backside of the parking lot, and after a brief bushwhack, continued east and 
north. A few checks slowed the pack enough that <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> caught up. There 
was some light swamp and a stream, but not too interesting. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi </FONT>and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Pat</FONT> led, closely followed by <FONT

color=#000000>Trail led north, and then east again, towards the powerlines. Back 
into the snake den paths, they turned west and after solving a few checks, found 
the “B” at a clearing next to the trail. But there was no B to be had, as the 
co-hare had not been informed where exactly to stop with the beer she was 
carrying. The group waited, and searched, in vain, for upwards of twenty 
minutes. There was no sight, noise, odor or other sign of the rest of the pack. 
So with some hard-feelings towards the hare, they decided to backtrack, and try 
to find the co-hare. <o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Which they soon did, finding her with the rest of the pack having 
their own private beer stop on another rock beside the trail. There was great 
rejoicing. Beer was opened, and songs begun when the hare burst out of the 
woods, breathless and looking over his shoulder. He had apparently encountered 
the law on his travels and feared pursuit. He was 
ignored.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finishing up the 
beer, they gave the hare a headstart to mark the trail back. Then, they mostly 
ignored the marks and followed the fields of Dame Farm south. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> went their 
own way, trying to get back to Brown Avenue. They didn’t soon find the street.

          did find a functioning 
electric fence. Good for him! It was just getting dark by the time they were all 
back, and they circled up just inside the woods.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Ratings for the run: 
virgins, bimbos, some territory which, if not actually virginal, was at least 
less-traveled, electric shocks, and no pavement, competed with the lack of beer 
at the designated beer check, lack of shiggy and uncooperative weather. Total: 
+0.69. The virgins were queried, and responded with a bizarre song fragment. 
Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, not for getting shocked, 
but for following <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>

Sparxx, where they were immediately ushered outside so as not to disturb the 
real customers.</FONT></SPAN>
