color=#000000>The Halloween Hash has always presented a bit of a challenge for 
the hare. What’s the point of getting dressed up and running in the woods 
observed only by fisher cats and hunting cameras? But all that pavement! Ouch! 
At any rate, the hare decided to follow tradition, and set the usual East Side 
extravaganza. Most showed up in costume, most notably <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> in a kilt, dressed as <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, and virgin <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Jonathan</FONT> 
as Carmen Miranda, complete with fruit basket hat.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns

color=#000000>The run started promisingly, descending behind the Eastside 
Marketplace to some shiggy along the river. The tide was in. The feet became 
wet. They came out to the infamous Railroad bridge and a check. Quickly, they 
moved on and came out to the streets via the soccer fields, and continued on 
Gano to India Point Park.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>After brief confusion, someone found the marks on the pedestrian 
overpass, and they were back on the streets again. Trail was mostly in chalk, 
and rather hard to see. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Jonathan</FONT>, yet another a 
victim of athletic prowess, was soon lost. But the rest, led by <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>CEP</FONT> found trail 
heading north. Now, another feature of the traditional RIH3 Halloween Hash, is 
of course, the Thayer Street parade. Mostly this is to provide an audience. So 
anyone with any intelligence would have simply headed for Thayer and scouted for 
marks. “Anyone with any intelligence..”, that’s the problem. They followed trail 
faithfully to George Street, into the Brown University Yard, and finally wound 
their way down to Thayer.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail left behind legions of confused college students and turned 
down Lloyd. A check sent them to the left behind Moses Brown. A beer check had 
been here several times before, so <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> wasted some time looking around the Quaker Meeting 
House. No luck. The faster and less-experienced thus led east downhill to 
Blackstone Boulevard. A check on the boulevard led to some confusion. But the 
hare nudged them straight, and they headed down to Blackstone 
Park.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>They entered the woods off Loring, and followed trail along the 
top of the ridge. A check sent most down to a meaningless bushwhack which soon 
returned to the top. Trail crossed Irving Ave. and continued in the woods, 
crossing the sewer overflow culvert. Finally they came to the Beer Check, 
overlooking River Road. The beer was easily found. Songs were sung, in 
celebration of the absence of both <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. Hash of the year!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finishing up, the hare pointed out that this was actually an 
“A-to-B” run, and they would not be circling at the cars. Trail continued south 
through the woods, crossing Angell, and ultimately coming out next to the “Red 
Bridge”. It turned right and led straight to the circle, at The Edge! A nice 
warm spot, with a cooler full of beer. Hash of the decade! Even the lost <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Jonathan</FONT> managed to show up, girlfriend in 
tow.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The run was rated. This is what I’m talking about: complaints, 
whinging, crying and wailing about pavement. Next time you all can just show 
your superhero costumes to the frigging raccoons, for all I care! Total: -6.9. 
The virgin was questioned, and sang. His girlfriend was hiding behind the Adult 
section of the Providence Phoenix, and declined invitations into the circle. 
Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT>, for being <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, even if only in costume. And after running down to 
collect cars, they headed off to the East Ave Café for the On On On. Hash of the 
millenium!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
