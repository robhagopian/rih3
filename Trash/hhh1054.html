<p><font color="#008000">Run #1054</font>, June 12, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Bondo Jovi</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Purple People Eater House – aka Bondo’s, Woonsocket, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 60's, sunny</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr. WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Dryfoot Fairy, Amish Ithead, Short Peck, 
Cumunder, Oozing, WIPOS, Trail Hoover, Great at Giving Head, Ben, Seamus.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Ok – this section should really be called “The Ride,” since there was no running.  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  What do you 
expect from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> though, he bike-hashed last week through Arcadia.  And may I bring up one 
more time, lost to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> (who was on foot, and yes – <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was on 
foot) in a race to the beer check.  HA-ha.</p>

<p>Throughout the ages there have been many famous left-turners including (but not limited to) Dale Earnhardt Sr., A.J. 
Foyt, Cale Yarborough, Bill Elliott, Richard Petty and the almighty Dick Trickle.  Those who should be added to that list 
are <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish 
Ithead</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Great at 
Giving Head</font> as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> “trail” was ALL lefts (the scribe would like to note that a 
right turn can be completed by making three consecutive lefts)!  Just like NASCAR! Yeeeee-haaaawww.  The only things 
needed to make this hash match a race-day were bimbos with teased blonde hair, a few pair of Wranglers and some coolers 
full of Busch Light.  All of which would have made this hash actually worth coming to!</p>

<p>A good sign of bad things to come was when <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> incorrectly posted directions to his own 
house.  His own house!  The rest of us should have taken these directions and run with them - meeting together in some 
random neighborhood in some random section of Woonsocket would surely have been better than 157 Meadow St and the crap 
trail that was soon to follow!</p>

<p>Once everyone showed up and prepped their mighty steeds for riding, trail led out of the driveway in the direction of 
three consecutive lefts.  At the next intersection the pack went again in the direction of three consecutive lefts prior 
to realizing their mistake and making two consecutive lefts to head back towards 114.  A three consecutive lefts turn was 
made onto 114 and shortly after a single left turn was made onto Farm St.  A little bit up the road a check was 
encountered, although a quick look through the neighborhood to the three consecutive lefts and cemetery to the single left 
showed that trail led……….straight.  Another check was located at Park St and despite Basket, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> making a three consecutive lefts rather than a single left they quickly 
found true trail after making a single left onto Summer St and then a three consecutive lefts back onto Farm St.  By this 
time the pack had spread out into two groups.  The front led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and his Mary 
Poppins-style bike, complete with a shock-absorbing post supporting the wide, plush seat and bell.  The rear led by, I 
don’t know – let’s say <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font> and her tight-fitting spandex shorts.</p>

<p>Everyone enjoyed the tour through the now-Massachusetts countryside cruising up Farm St until a check was encountered 
at a crazy intersection – my God, five roads!  Handy Rd, Farm St, Blackstone St N, Blackstone St S, and Milk St.  Where to 
go?  Knowing at this point that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was lazy (ok, we knew that well before) and just 
looping us around in a large circle jerk, the left onto Milk St was chosen and the pack continued on.  At this point two 
disturbing incidents occurred.  The first was conducted by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> as he suavely said 
“helllooo ladies” to a pair of 12 year old girls walking up the street coming back from a swim.  The second was conducted 
by, well – <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, as he said “helllloo ladies” to a pair of sheep in a roadside pen.  Ok, 
the last event isn’t 100% accurate, but I definitely noticed some increased excitement in his pedaling as we neared the 
soft, warm, wool-covered creatures.</p>

<p>As Milk St neared the intersection of Lincoln St, a mean gang of middle-school aged BMX bikers were encountered, but 
due to the hash’s superior athletic ability were quickly passed and a left turn onto Lincoln St left them in our dust.  At 
this point the pack knew there was no chance of a beer stop and that we were being led back to the hare’s house.  A three 
consecutive lefts was made onto Blackstone St and then a single left onto Ascension St.  Another three consecutive lefts 
was made onto Federal St leading us to the CVS and Main/Harris St – where a single left was made bringing us to the home 
stretch.  A “BN” was spotted, but at this point it meant nothing knowing were the beer was and a final single left was 
made onto Meadow plopping us in front of the hare.  If you choose to call him that.</p>

<p>Somehow <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> was there, despite us front runners never seeing him on “trail.”  
Hopefully he was smart and made a quick two consecutive lefts at the beginning bringing him back to the hare’s house in 
order to enjoy beer and solidarity.  Criticism was instantly brought up on the lack of trail quality, with nothing but 
excuses being fired back by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  “I was golfing yesterday and didn’t have time to 
pre-set.”  “I was live-haring so had to keep trail simple.”  Waaaaa.  Pathetic!  A moment of compassion was had for the 
pack still left on the roads , and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> agreed to pay <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
triple the hash expenses if all came back without help.  Of course triple of $0 is $0.  Surprisingly, the rest of the pack 
straggled in shortly after, and everyone was itching to circle up and vent their frustrations.  Comments included “beauty 
shiggy by the side of the road – that we didn’t ride though,” “I need to get some brownie points and I thought the trail 
was great despite my friend having a 40th birthday party causing me to show up late but at least I’m something something 
something……..,” “I’ll start with a list of everything that was good about this trail – nothing,” and “after this debacle 
I’ll never attend another <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> hash again.”  Total score was <b>-69</b>, which in my opinion 
is far better than it should have been.  <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> was brought into the circle as a 
back-slider and last week’s dualing hashits of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
managed to nominate, and successfully appoint, Oozing as this week’s hashit.  Something about him not keeping his mouth 
shut.</p>

<p>Beers, burgers, potato salad and other goodies were enjoyed by all as the hare’s wife controlled the grill (showing the 
hare was just as lazy as hosting as he was at setting trail).  Talk was amazingly devoid of Interhash plans, and 
<font color="#FF0000">Cumunder’s</font> quandary on her July 3rd hash was feverishly debated.  May I say, masterdebated?  
Despite the romantic feeling of the tiki torches and blood-sucking mosquitoes people slowly started leaving as the night 
progressed.  May this be the last bike hash the RIH3 needs to endure……..</p>
