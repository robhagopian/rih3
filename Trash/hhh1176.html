style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Another 
brilliant trail,&nbsp;most likely to be rated...Hash&nbsp;of the Year! The hare 
started from the Rome Point Parking area just north of 138 on Rt 1A, at the 
sight of a previous winter run from <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>. But it was 
nearly all virgin territory nevertheless. The trail started off well: a few 
hundred yards to a right turn, and a crossing of some thigh-to-waist high mud, 
soon followed by briars. The screams and squeals of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Cumsocket To Me</FONT> were most gratifying.&nbsp;<FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing </FONT>didn’t want to 
get wet. They found the thicker briars, and paid the price for dry legs in 
blood.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail was one 
long bushwhack on deer paths, southeast, then east. A few checks were easily 
mastered, but the slow going kept the group pretty much together as they made 
their way out to a dirt road. This check had them fooled a bit. It led to the 
shore, where it turned out that the marks on the beach were invisible in the 
waning light. <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> finally found his way to an 
arrow leading back from the water to a check on the 
powerlines.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> had caught up by now, but <FONT color=#ff0000>Good 
Pie Hunting</FONT> could be heard (“RU??!”) way off in the distance. Too bad for 
him! If Newporters keep showing up, less beer for the rest of us. Trail was 
found and lost, found and lost again in a maze of scrub pine trails. They headed 
northwest and ultimately came out on the path to the point. If you were hare, 
wouldn’t you have wanted your beer stop out on the point? Scenic vistas, seals 
on the rocks, a gentle fall breeze, high tide, and all. The long falsie out to 
the point worked most satisfactorily. Especially for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>. Hash of the Year!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">True trail led 
west along the shoreline, and then, at a check turned into a salt marsh and the 
beer check. Despite the early arrivals opening the beer and peanuts, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Haines</FONT> and then <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> 
tried to keep going past the group, but were called back by <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. Bad <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>! Hashit 
material, obviously. Eventually, even <FONT color=#ff0000>Good Pie 
Hunting</FONT> made it in, and the songs started.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Finishing up, 
trail continued west. They came to the remnants of the railroad bridge across 
the improbably-named Wannuchecomecut Brook. A check sent some across, but the 
hare led down into a salt marsh. Trail lingered just long enough to keep the 
feet wet, then turned left into briars and another bushwhack. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> led, and 
they came back to the main trail. There were a few checks and falsies, but the 
group eventually found their way south and back to the 
start.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The circle was 
formed in the woods adjoining the parking area. No pavement, fresh water swamp 
and two salt marshes, briars and briars and briars, no <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, and three bimbos! Run of the Year! But jealousy is a 
green-eyed monster and the rating: -0.69! The visitor was punished, the 
two-timers were brought into the circle again (and again, that weird Tonga 
song!), and the Hashit was given back to <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. 
Finishing up, they headed for the Oak Hill Tavern Steak Fry. Another perfect 
ending for the&nbsp;best candidate so far for...&nbsp;Hash of the 
Year!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
