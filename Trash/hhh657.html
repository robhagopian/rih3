North Kingstown Park 'N Ride</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>They came between the holidays...only to get wet...very, very wet....

<P>A handful of pitiful wankers on the quest for good beer were greeted
by
<BR>the hares, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Cheap</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT>....already
soaked from the hard driving rain
<BR>after running to the start of the run. The red floury substance used
to
<BR>mark trail, covered their persons, and looked as if a murder had been
<BR>committed. Fearless they were, those hashers, nothing could stop their
<BR>quest for good beer. <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">WIPOS</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Async,
Bondo, Oozie</FONT> and some lowlife Newport
<BR>wanker who goes by the handle <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Spank Me</FONT>
were off at the sound of the
<BR>legendary RI horn...led by the hounds <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Jake</FONT>
and <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">SOB</FONT>. Sliding most of the
<BR>way, with freezing rain in their faces, down to the shores of
<BR>Narragansett Bay, no tricks yet....although there was banter about
a
<BR>circle jerk....the only jerk was <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Bondo</FONT>
falling flat on his face from
<BR>tripping on a rather large obvious brick...damn, he's not hurt....one
<BR>less beer for the rest of us....

<P>On down the beach with the whining of ....ooohhh, my pussy hurts and
<BR>it's sooooo hard to run on the sand! Suck it up boys! A mile or so
later
<BR>with a rather uneventful jog down the beach, we came upon the long
<BR>awaited beer stop and warmed our souls by the virtual fire. A well
<BR>thought out plan of the elder of the hares: carry 400 pounds of wood
<BR>about 3/4 of a mile so it can sit in the rain and get wet....it'll
light
<BR>and be warm and glowing by the time we get to the beer stop....that's
<BR>his story...always a dreamer, that <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Basket</FONT>.

<P>The smarter of the hares...the only female wanker
<BR>present...decided,..well OK, begged, pleaded and groveled that it was
<BR>just too cold to go on...and the trail was washed out from the rain
<BR>anyway....please, lets go home and drink warm, mulled cider and be
<BR>happy. It worked! So there we were, the sorry lot of us, shortcutting
to
<BR>the cars so we would not die of hypothermia.

<P>We piled in the cars of the hares....cleverly left at the end of the
<BR>trail....and brought everyone back to the start. Delayed only by the
<BR>drug dealer who was making a deal with one of his clients....that would
<BR>be <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Oozie</FONT>, our CIA double agent drug dealer....that's
Pakistani for
<BR>psychiatrist...we formed a caravan to <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Cheap's</FONT>
house and stuffed
<BR>ourselves with spicy food, good beer and warm cider.
