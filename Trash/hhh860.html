<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Well, the hare raising d’erections brought most of the hashers to the start, I assume, in a timely 
fashion.&nbsp; Those of us knuckleheaded enough to follow the screeching bigwheeled 
truck of <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> (though he has been to 
Arcadia hashes multiple times in the past) were given a wonderful tour of 
Connecticut state.&nbsp; We actually heard the harmonious sound of Foxwood tokens 
falling through the slots of onlooking Wampanoags before pulling a Uee and 
sprinting back to find trail.&nbsp; But, like our esteemed scribe
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. Who</font>, I digress…</p>

<p>So, latecummers<font color="#FF0000"> Basket, Swallows</font> and visitor <font color="#FF0000">Mormon the 
Sermon</font> arrived and again foolishly followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> through “shortcuts” full of more 
than the usual shiggy – actual terrain mimicking Viet-freaking-nam.&nbsp; Bugle sounds bounded from the leach infested 
swamp as Basket vainly tried to lead his small pack to the rest of the hashers.&nbsp; Whistles and trumpets responded.
&nbsp; Legs were shredded.&nbsp; Blood was shed.&nbsp; Tears were not shed.&nbsp; Repeat, NOT shed.</p>

<p>Finally, brambles and briars and several blood transfusions later (though this is usually
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. Who’s</font> territory; where was he tonight, 
anyways?&nbsp; Probably sewing up his own pitiful hasher legs) the pack was 
reunited.&nbsp; After climbing out of a foxhole, lights could be seen bobbing up and 
down in the distance across the bubbling brook.&nbsp; Was this the enemy approaching 
on the hill?&nbsp; Yes and no – it’s the wanker pack!&nbsp; Running alongside a beautiful, 
glimmering river, <font color="#FF0000">Swallows </font>and
<font color="#FF0000">Mormon</font> tried desperately to find an outlet while
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> all too willingly braved the cold waters and 
waded across (thankfully not in the nude this time).&nbsp; Ben and Jake bounded in 
and out of the water, trying to play with <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font>&nbsp; 
Trail was marked well with toilet paper (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
would like to extend a big thanks to the raging hare for having that handy in 
the deep woods).&nbsp; Trail and checks continued along with underbrush, brambles and 
trees that tried to claim many a RIH3 eye.&nbsp; Somewhere around this time,
<font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> lost the aid of her trusty flashlight.&nbsp; 
Now, a quick question.&nbsp; How could those practically new batteries have run out 
already, especially to a harriette named <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>?&nbsp; 
Soccer mom tried to blame it on her kids, but we all know where her battery 
power is really going.&nbsp; Just ask KNO.</p>

<p>And so, with the bright moon to guide <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> and all, the pack kept form on 
river right while <font color="#FF0000">Swallows</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Mormon</font> paralleled river left, not daring to go 
waist-deep in water.&nbsp; Curving around by the start and heading down paved road to 
catch up, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
could be seen chugging along Rt. 165, needing a pathetic break from the shiggy.&nbsp; 
Hashers chugged along through the woods just off road while the hare flitted 
ahead tantalizing us with promises of beer.</p>

<p>Soon enough, just atop a beautiful needle covered, tree laden hill, the pack arrived at the Beer Check.&nbsp; 
Despite his claimed back injury, <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>was still 
the freaking FRB – was he trying to impress his physical therapist?&nbsp; Because 
she’s not here! &nbsp;Headcount was correct, surprisingly no one was lost to the 
mirck and swamps of Arcadia - yet.&nbsp; Just as <font color="#FF0000">Swallows</font> 
boasted to <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> that she had never fallen on 
trail, she discovered a knee deep beer trap right in front of the cooler.&nbsp; Only 
a flesh wound, don’t worry.&nbsp; Very crafty, <font color="#FF0000">Raging Queen of 
Beers</font>!&nbsp; At this point, the virgin mother <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Shiela</font> looked on hesitantly while her son Just Nick begged her to hold him.&nbsp; Song ensued.</p>

<p>Leaving the foliage and perplexing trail behind, the pack dashed back to the cars for circle up.&nbsp; Beer 
was found again.&nbsp; Though we drank from bottles marked Sam Adams Lager, no one 
could fool the all knowing hashers and harriettes.&nbsp; We actually were consuming
<font color="#FF0000">Raging’s</font> Budweiser bottled under the guise of Sam 
Adams way back in 1969.&nbsp; OK, <font color="#FF0000">QOB</font>, you can stop 
trying to pawn that off - we can see through the peeling labels and lipstick 
stained rims.&nbsp; We know where this beer has been!&nbsp; Then again, that never stopped or killed any hasher.</p>

<p>With our musty smells, musty beer, and shivering bods the hare was called to the center.&nbsp; Overall, the shitty 
trail was rated a 6.9.&nbsp; Then the virgin was called into the circle.&nbsp; Though she 
did not know the correct square root of 69, we were all impressed by her lack of 
sexual position preference.&nbsp; She answered “I like all of them.”&nbsp; A true 
Renaissance woman!&nbsp; She sang some nursery rhyme, drank a down down, and poured 
the rest over <font color="#FF0000">Just Nick’s</font> head – just what he 
deserves for roping his mother into this!&nbsp; No hashit was to be found tonight.&nbsp; 
We harmonized to a round of Swing Low, then tried to rename
<font color="#FF0000">Swallows</font> as <font color="#FF0000">Swallows Oozing’s 
Pride</font> and made the latecummers drink a down down.&nbsp; Then, off to the On After…</p>

<p>Where else would a group of rowdy Rhodey hashers go in southern Rhode Island but Mark's Place.&nbsp; They 
actually like us there.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; More beer was consumed and burgers 
downed.&nbsp;&nbsp; All-in-all, a fantastic full moon hash.&nbsp; On on to next week!</p>
