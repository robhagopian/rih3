<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well the run started duly at 630pm with
d'erections and promises from the hare mostly for the benefit of his running
friends that the run would be short (they're obviously accustomed to his dubious
ways), and the pack set off up towards the fort and eastwards into the forest,
going thru a couple of checks with little difficulty except for Async who
recalled his youthful days as a boy scout being buggered by the older scouts at
a certain stream/falls towards which he instinctively ran and was not heard of
for a while.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The rest of the pack ran behind Bondo
(experienced in short cutting) and yours truly, on trail that stayed in the
lovely forest over streams with wooden bridges and little shiggy (so far) and
unto the first beer check. The pack crossed the stream and enjoyed the beer as
Bondo first peed into the stream then jumped into it and played with himself for
awhile. Off in the not too far distance were heard gunshots and we feared Async
and Ben may be straying onto private property but soon after the two appeared
both with mysterious smiles on their faces and Ben bumming everyone for a
fag.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The pack then set off again N'eastwards back onto
trail and this time many a trail led to shiggy with the nefarious hare leading
the way on false trails with ten marks before a cross mark. Oozing unwittingly
led the pack into two such shiggy trails and the women vowed never to follow him
even if he did have a cute bum. Async by this time was well onto the second beer
check and the pack soon joined him across another rocky stream and more
beer.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The woods were truly lovely and it was a perfect
eve and the mosquitoes thought so too and soon drove the pack out and back onto
trail with more false checks soon onto trail that led back to the start. However
soon Yours truly ventured off onto the trail that led to the first beer check
and in exasperation off trail and discovered what potential this run could have
had: more shiggy, briars, briars and did I say briars? All cut up I ended up
drifting towards the sounds of singing(or what sounded like...) and came upon
the pack that were well into the circle and appointed the hashit to me, for I
can only imagine, for being such a great hasher.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The comments I missed but I doubt the rating was
above zero. The circle on top of the lookout with the blazing red sunset over
the bay was pretty amazing tho'. ONON was at the A-One pizza place on 81N, and
who could beat $4 individual pizzas with six toppings and Bass? Too bad for the
RedSox, but if only they were a RI team....ONON.&nbsp;</font></p>
