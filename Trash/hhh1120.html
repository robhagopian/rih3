<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">The Lincoln Mud Bath Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1120</font>, September 17, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Lincoln Woods/ Chase Farm</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Clear, 60’s</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Concrete Feet, Fuwangi Boner, Bondo Jovi, Ben. 
Visitors/Transplants(?):  Donkey Punch, Pubic Housing (Every Day is Wednesday H3, D.C.). Virgin: Just Miranda.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The run started off in a parking lot (marked: “Parking for Maintenance Workers Only”, clearly the right place.) <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was first there, soon joined by <font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font> (a virgin), <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> (a backslider), <font color="#FF0000">Donkey Punch</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">
Pubic Housing</font> (visitors). The hare was absent. Now this is the way a hash should start! Two women, and no <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. But it couldn’t last. Along came <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Oh well. Then, along came 6:30. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> found trail on the bridge 
heading south on Manchester Printworks Road.</p>

<p>After some brief confusion, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> found marks on 
the far side of the banks of the pond. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led on the far side, the rest tried the near side 
but eventually crossed over. The hare’s foot prints could be followed. But it turned out that the conditions had changed 
since the flour had been placed (the day before). Stepping into the hare’s track was no guarantee that you would not end 
up thigh deep, in the viscous clay/mud. Ah, it was heaven! Especially when <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> took one 
look from the bridge, said: “F**k this!”, and headed off into Lincoln woods. Especially, when <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> took Ben with him! And even more especially when <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> went into the mud up to 
where his testicles would have been had they not fled already into his abdomen. He called <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
for help. Ha!</p>

<p>On the other side, they rest crossed in a shallow area, drawn on by <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> laughter and 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi’s</font> whining. Too bad for them! The trail crossed back and entered the woods. The by now 
freed <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> joined <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> (you’d think with a name like 
that, he’d have been neck deep in the mud by now, but I digress!) and they made their way up to a path and out. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Donkey</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font> were almost 
across when <font color="#FF0000">Pubic Housing</font> went in the muck right up to the housings of her pubics. A 
seemingly reluctant (?) <font color="#FF0000">Donkey</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> helped her out, and they 
emerged just in time to meet the hare on the path. It was all downhill from this point! Even the uphill parts!</p>

<p>Trail crossed Rt 123 and entered a small open park, where <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> could be seen trying to master a check. The pack rejoined, and turned west and then north 
into the woods. The trail led on paths uphill, and through a few sideyards and backyards on what apparently was some sort 
of Lincoln Greenway right-of-way. There were few challenges and no more shiggy as they headed gradually west out of the 
woods and into some fields. They skirted along the edges of the fields. They began to follow a cross-country path marked 
with white paint in the grass. They continued northwest, through a tree nursery and came out to a more overgrown field 
where the flour was lost. The hare arrived. The hare looked around nonchalantly. The hare pretended he personally wasn’t 
lost. The hare is a poor actor. Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> decided to ignore the hare. He headed 
downhill, came across some marks, and eventually led the pack west to Great Road.</p>

<p>The pack began to thin out as they jogged at varying speeds southeast on Great Road. But <font color="#FF0000">Concrete 
Feet</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font>, perhaps rejuvenated by the mud treatments, sped ahead. It was 
getting dark at this point, so the flashlights came out. <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Just Miranda</font> didn’t have flashlights. So although they made it on trail back across 123 and into Lincoln woods, 
they were not seen or heard from again. Another virgin down the drain! The rest of the pack followed into Lincoln woods. 
Marks were found and lost several times, until <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> found the hare and the BC at one of 
the roofless stone cabins. The beer was at last opened. The rhubarb (such as it was with such a small pack) rose to its 
natural size.</p>

<p>On In trail was debated. Was it worth trying the woods, or would it be simpler to just take the damn road? But with 
visitors present, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> were shamed into running in 
the woods. Marks were found. They were followed for about 200 yds. Marks were lost again. So they just bushwhacked to the 
ball-fields, and straight east out to Manchester Printworks Rd, and the cars. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> and the virgin were waiting. They decided to circle up in the woods behind The Lodge, so 
they convoyed up 123, parked in the usual spots and walked back towards to pond.</p>

<p>The circle was joined and the run rated. Fine mud, female:male ratio 2:6, loss of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
and quality beer outweighed the missing virgin at the BC, the recycled trail and the false promises of Civil War 
re-enactments by the hare. Total: <b>+6.9</b>! The visitors were queried and freely admitted that they lived across the 
street from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>! At least they had managed to keep him from showing up! The virgin was 
questioned, and told a joke. Why do they never want to show a body part? Why, Why, Why??! After religion, they moved on 
into The Lodge, where the food was adequate, the beer was cold, and only a few pieces of popcorn ended up in <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> beer. And if we ever see these visitors and this virgin again, it’ll be their own damn 
fault!</p>
