<p><font color="#008000">Run #1064</font>, August 21, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Trail Hoover</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Franklin State Forest, MA</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 80’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Oozing SD, Dr W.H.O., Eenie Weenie Dick, Justin My Ass, WIPOS, Amish It 
Head, Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, Ben.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>This writeup will be more pathetic than ever, because a) the run was three months ago, b) there was nothing memorable 
about the trail, c) I can’t think of a way to avoid writing this in the first person, and d) I, your scribe and most 
personable of all hashers, shortcutted the whole thing.  About all I can remember, is that when I shortcutted straight to 
the BC, I looked for the beer for about 30 minutes. I came within two yards of the cache and still managed to miss it. 
They do say that wanking makes you go blind. But I can make up stuff with the best of them. So…</p>

<p>The hare set trail from the parking lot of some sort of business on Grove Street, in Franklin MA, within sight of some 
powerlines. The group gathered and for a while, it looked good. But just at 6:25, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
showed up! You know, there really is no reason that we can’t start a little early sometimes. If the hare wants to, I mean. 
The group set out briefly southwest on Grove St. To our surprise, the trail was not found on either side of the 
powerlines. It continued straight on the road for another 100 yards. Of course, I soon found the true trail, turning 
right. We entered the woods heading west.</p>

<p>The hash was together for the most part, led by <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Justin My 
Ass</font>. It was all path, no shiggy, and the few checks were easily mastered. The flour suffered from the recent 
rainfall, and was difficult to discern in most areas. There were plenty of puddles (but all were avoidable). The trail was 
full of switchbacks and turns, and what little sense of direction the hashers had was soon completely gone. This is a 
recipe for a classic. Always adventurous, I tried a right at a check, and was soon off on my own altogether. The rest 
turned left (south) on true trail. As far as I know, they got involved in a long and boring clockwise tour of the Franklin 
State Forest. They were pretty much herded by the hare, I think. Marks gone from the rain, and such. They didn’t have 
anywhere near the fun I had. Not much more to say about that, is there? Aren’t you glad I can’t describe this in the usual 
nauseating detail? I should try to get lost more often. It’ll please all of us. Me, most of all.</p>

<p>My side of the story is this: I found myself on an unmarked trail. I came to the powerlines, but couldn’t find a mark. 
So I turned back. I found a second unmarked trail, and by the sound of it, I was paralleling <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> who must have been on yet another trail. This is how I like it. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> on another 
trail, I mean. But my path curved north, while the sounds of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> continued west. I like 
this also. Having seen a map of the State Forest, I knew north led to a water tower. Good place for a beer check, I 
thought. So I carried on, came out at the water tower, found a “B”. Thirty minutes from the start! What a hasher! 
Unfortunately, despite another thirty minutes of searching, I couldn’t find the “b”. It sucked to be me then, I can tell 
you. Finally, I gave up and turned west and downhill, following trail backwards. But really, <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> cares?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> continued to lead on the long circle west of Spring Street. 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> did their best to get lost, and the hare was 
near the front of the pack, frantically remarking. Or is that re-marking? Turning east, <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> 
saw me trying to erase a check mark. Damn! Foiled again! And then the hare showed up. She was heartily cursed by yours 
truly for being competent at hiding beer (see run <a href="hhh1060.html">#1060</a>.) (Dammit!). The three of us, pursued 
by <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> ran back south then east to the water tower. 
The hare showed me my own footprints within a few feet of the stash.  It REALLY sucked to be me, now!</p>

<p>The beer was brought out to the shadows of the water tower, and opened with some Cheetos and chips. Unfortunately, 
everyone found the BC. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> even made it. We hid but <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
directed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> around to where the group was hiding. The beer was opened, a few songs were 
sung, and the hare and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> started talking rock-climbing again. This is getting old. The 
least you could do is get your arm trapped in a crevice or a crevasse or <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> ass or 
something so’s you have to gnaw it off or something, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Maybe then we’ll listen to your 
stories. But it was getting dark. The flies were enjoying themselves, though. Finally, we set off, east on Forge Rd, past 
the Scout camp, and the southeast on a path to the powerlines. Couldn’t totally skip a powerline, now could we.</p>

<p>We gathered to circle. It was now pitch black in the woods, perfect for circling up. So we elected to hold the 
ceremonies in view of the road, under the blazing spotlights of the powerline switching station. Brilliant! Ratings for 
the run: virgin territory, soaked flour, puddles, flies, and my pitiful showing at the BC far outweighed the lack of real 
shiggy and the presence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Total: <b>6.9</b>! 
Hashit: now here’s a Hobson’s choice!. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was the obvious candidate? But every one knows 
they’re in for a long, annoying, and confusing song every time I get hashit. My songs to the hash are like a cross to a 
vampire. Naturally, I don’t get hashit often. It ultimately went to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>! Finishing up, we 
went on to the Piccadilly Pub nearby, and had some good food and some excellent local microbrew. Not a bad ending. (Even 
if I am making it all up.)</p>
