The we’ve done it before and we can do it again hash<br/>
Where: Library, Swansea, MA<br/>
Hares: Turd the Beaver<br/>
Present: Rusty, WIPOS, DonkeyPunch, Pubic Housing, Basket,  Who, Just the Tip, PG, Fancy Pants <br/><br/>

Weather: pleasant low 40s with a southwesterly breeze dipping into the low 30’s at circle <br/>
The Run: #1706? Nope #1723<br/>
November 19, 2018? – or March 18, 2018
<br/><br/>
What did you expect from a Turd run?
Hashit: I believe DonkeyPunch for NOT hanging around to NOT complain.

The End
<br/><br/>
Above is Oozy’s weak write up of basically the same trail that Turd set in November 2018. Here is a summary of both trails – We ran around the trails, the marks were confusing, beer was difficult to find, Donkey got hashit for no apparent reason.
<br/><br/>
This time Oozy didn’t show up to accept hashit for not hanging around.
<br/><br/>
Donkeypunch got hashit for putting on pants when the temperature dropped. The hashit ligit should have gone to WIPOS for losing his phone on trail – AGAIN. But he was still wandering around looking for it during circle so what can you do. I am not one to complain.
<br/><br/>
Lots to complain about but the Swansea trails are always fun to run, temperatures are rising and it was light until almost 7:40. Overall fun trail with ample beer and no Oozy so we gave it a -0.0.
