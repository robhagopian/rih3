<p>A counterclockwise loop, beginning at the turn off for the parking area, and heading northeast on a gas pipeline which 
led to Center Trail. The fine weather led to fine icing of the ground, the bushes and leaves; but still was warm enough to 
provide fine swamp shiggy underfoot.<br><br>

The trail led north off the Center trail into the woods, leading to the first of several major and minor crossings of Keach 
Brook and its branches. <br><br>

The Inner Border trail was reached and followed to the covered bridge, crossed east and then taking a completely 
unnecessary shiggy romp up the North South Trail, into the woods through more excellent wetness and back to the covered 
bridge. The hare's a wank! <br><br>

Back west on the Inner Border Trail then south into the woods to the Hemlock Glen Trail, and the BC, near Peck Pond. No 
one lost at any time. Pathetic.<br><br>

On out to the pond, then south out via the warm-up hut and the parking area and back to Pulaski Road and the cars.<br><br>
