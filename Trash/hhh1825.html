Date: Feb 15, 2021<br/>
Where: Sakonnet Greenway, Middletown<br/>
Hare: Crabby Shag<br/>
Hashers: OOzing, Basket, WHO, WIPOS, Ass Quack, Pussy Galore, Rusty  <br/>
Hashit: Just Pat<br/><br/> 

Trash:<br/>
Prelube A was at Rusty's which was not really communicated above the level of bad Basket jokes and thus sparsely attended. Prelube B was at the trail start at Sakonnet Greenway Trailhead and included beers and discussions of COVID infections and the reliability of testing. I'm told (and verified by map) that the soccer fields are nearby but they were not visible from the start (snow, trees, darkness...). Your scribe prepared and had a Captain's Daughter while we waited for the caravan of those prelubing indoors to join us.<br/><br/>

They all arrived and we got a 'chalk' talk. The hare showed us a fantastic looking system of food coloring in a spray bottle for marking and laid a beautiful looking 'example'. The hare was also so kind as to tell us that if we wanted to avoid the shiggy we should just blow through the arrow off the trail.<br/><br/>

We proceeded to try to follow marks, which, despite being double laid, were virtually invisible at triail time as they seemingly melted a bit and turned a neutral grey. Your scribe did not see any of these marks and ended up trailing pack with WIPOS and the hare. When the hare learned that WIPOS and I were interested in the shiggy she told us we missed the arrow into this shiggy and we all backtracked to find it. None of the tree of us ever found the arrow but we saw footprints and followed them for a lovely romp through wetlands and coyote dens - and then back out to the trail.<br/><br/>

We eventually were able to locate the beer which was guarded by a snowperson built by the hare and her hellspawn. The snowman was endowed by your scribe (who was hand delivered a Captain's Daughter by the hare!) and the hare almost enjoyed herself on this. <br/><br/>

Trail was a butt-plug-esque - out trail was the in-trail (minus the shiggy). Circle was near the Prelube B. The obvious hash*t was the hare's lesser half who abandoned her and his hellspawn to the coyotes who must be very hungry at this time of year. The pack being hashers, this was rejected and your scribe was elected for a second time by a huge margin, like our 'former' president. On-after was the first commercial dining for RIH3 in ages at Fieldstones and was delicious.<br/><br/>

Question of the trash: Would you rather watch porn of your parents or of Basket and Bondo?
