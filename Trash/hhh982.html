<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 20’s, Clear, Still plenty of Snow.</p>

Ben, Seamus.<br><font color="#0000FF">Not Present (week 4):</font> Just Ariana.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The week delayed Rabbie Burns hash was poorly attended compared to the past, no doubt because of the rescheduling. 
But all save <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (a wank!) and <font color="#FF0000">DFF</font> (an ignoramus) wore 
kilts. It was a clockwise circle with too much pavement, too few bimbos, and too little effort on the part of the 
hare. Don’t try to forgive him because he set two weeks in a row. He’s a wank, and that’s that. You need read no 
further.</p>

<p>O.K., if you must! From Burrillville High School trail led out to Whipple Road heading southeast. It kept 
heading southeast. And kept going. Luckily, there were snow drifts to run in, because all that pavement was very 
painful. Finally, at Rt 102, the trail turned southwest. A check led to the Water Treatment access road. It turned 
northwest. On more pavement.&nbsp; True trail turned right for a loop in the woods that only <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> was stupid enough to take. Everyone else skipped this by following the hare. [God knows what <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> did, as they were only just arriving at the 
High School.] An unmarked whiskey check was held on an unplowed dirt road. Some nice single malt was shared. No signs 
of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> or <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>. But <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
was sighted, struggling up through snow drifts, swearing mightily. So it had to be cut short. They continued northwest 
to a check which ultimately led into woods and soon to the landfill. Promising? Yeah, maybe, but it still sucked, as 
they paralleled the landfill along a fence. They made a gradual semicircle towards the east. Another check turned left 
to the north, on a snow-covered dirt road to the BC.</p>

<p>The BC was quiet until <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB </font>arrived, 
provoking howls of derisive laughter. Finishing up, they faced the inevitable: the hare was trying to recoup some 
points and pointed out the trail back, crossing the Clear River. Ooh! It was so scary! And wet. Don’t make us cross 
that stream; it’s at least 10” deep! Wah Wah Wah! But it was only a short hop back to the cars from there, emerging 
by the ice-skating Rink. They changed and drove back to the hare’s house for the circle.</p>

<p>The circle was quickly dispatched. Ratings: failure to take advantage of the snow, contrived shiggy, prolonged 
pavement, and the lack of lost hashers balanced the Whiskey and beer checks, the enjoyment of watching <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>struggle, and the general amnesty associated with kilt-wearing. Total: +0.69. Hashit: 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, for no good reason. After religion, Haggis was produced with the traditional 
toast, and “Ode to a Haggis”, and they settled in to eat, to watch a soft-core schoolgirl/kilt movie (“Exotica”, now 
on all our NetFlix lists!), and show each other what exactly was under their kilts. Horrible!</p>
