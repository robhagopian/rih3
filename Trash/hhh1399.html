Ahhh, run O’ the week someone said, that’ll give ya a taste as to what ye missed and there were plenty a’hasher missin. Snow was in the forecast, fair weather hashers took this as an excuse to refrain from showing up but they were sadly mistaken as this was a beautiful night full of mystery and adventure.<br><br>

The only way to describe the cars in the very small parking lot would be akin to having 12 cars park in a 12 pack. We were wedged in to the extent that only a contortionist could have made an attempt at stealing any of the vehicles in the lot. But, the best was yet to happen – the hare informed us that the trail was pre-set which is normally not an issue. However, we now had two inches of snow on top of his markings which made trail somewhat more of a challenge than we are used to.<br><br>

That said, Basket decided he knew where trail went so he headed in an easterly direction. WHO had set trail there before and knew that south was the real direction, the only hint from the hare was that the beer stop was at a Christmas tree that was out of place, Rusty was looking for the elusive Christmas tree in a massive expanse of snow and trees to no avail. We were running in an area that was covered in snow, but as you ran and broke the covering you found out that we were actually running on sand, there were large dunes ahead that normally looked like ominous structures that exuded heat but tonight that heat was under wraps and we were looking at a mini Everest instead.<br><br>

A small out of place tree was found but the hare laughed at the suggestion that this might be the beer stop, this was after climbing Everest, and so as time came to pass we wandered on down the far side of the hill and into a valley that was more secluded from the world and shielded from the weather. The hare was seen huddled over a bunch of stuff that looked like beer, but he was actually getting ready to light a fire. The pack sniffed out the beer that was hidden in two places in the bushes and we were soon gathered around the warmth of a small glow.<br><br>

Wee Balls informed us of the numbering system on the beers for the night, something like the low numbers are beers you don’t want to drink and the high numbers are the one’s to have. For the uninitiated and even the initiated this was an issue, as we kept messing things up. The fire grew bigger as Crabby added a pallet, SheMail tossed in a bit o’spit and Basket said let’s do some fire walking………right now you probably wish you were there and could have seen what happened, but since you didn’t want to spend the $1 hash cash you will never know.<br><br>

After the fire walking competition and dousing of every single ember we decided to retire to the circle beside the cars. The run was rated a 10,069.9 because it was so good and Basket got Hash Shit because………..<br><br>

The select few retired to JC’s Pub only to be hit for a $1 hash cash by WHO, total takings $3. The bartendress told us of her recent escapades in Ireland, Basket tried to tell her the joke about the road from Cork but that’s something you’d have to have been there to hear. Don’t miss the next one – every hash is different and every hash has a different story.<br>
