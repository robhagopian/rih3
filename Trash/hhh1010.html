<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">The Hash of Wrong Assumptions</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1010</font>, August 8, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Jamestown, RI (Beavertail State Park).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Around 80ish, cloudy, breezy, and humid.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket, Oozing, Dr. WHO, Dry Foot Fairy, Tinker, Trail Hoover (SESYB), 
Great at Giving Head, Just Nathaniel, and Seamus.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Backsliders:</font>&nbsp;  Beyond Hope, Red Snapper, and Cum Again.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Visitors:</font>&nbsp; kraM (DCH4) and Balls on Barbwire (Jolly Roger H3, Tampa Bay).<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Late Cummers:</font>  Bondo and Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><font color="#0000FF">Pre-lube:</font><br><br>
A cool ocean breeze and overcast sky tempered the dense inland August heat and humidity – the kind of evening that beckons 
a hash.  Weather conditions aside, that WIPOS would start a hash on the tip of a thin peninsula at the southern-most end 
of Conanicut Island would likely ensure that:<br><br>
(1) In order to get lost on trail, one would have to drown somewhere in Narragansett Bay.<br><br>
(2) The trail would have to be straight, uninteresting, and incredibly boring.<br><br>
(3) With well-groomed walking paths, well-traveled shore-front, and only one road into and out of Beavertail Park, there 
would be no potential for unexpected surprises.<br><br>
All three assumptions would soon prove to be wrong.  And they weren’t the only assumptions to be proven wrong on this 
hash.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>With <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> hanging out with <font color="#FF0000">Balls On Barbwire</font>, visiting 
from Jolly Roger H3 in Tampa Bay, the two enjoyed a refreshing IPA (not <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> IPA), while 
the hare <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> arrives at 5:45 p.m.  Without seeing any flower along North Main Rd, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> asked <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> if he was live-haring the run.  Right!  No, 
Wrong!  The hare pointed to the arrow in the parking lot pointing southeast.  Duh.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> arrived early enough to mooch off of 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot’s</font> beer.  You’d think they’d get a pre-lube from the hare.  Wrong.  The hare was 
overly protective of his thinning beer supply – an ominous sign.</p>

<p>Then <font color="#FF0000">Great at Giving Head</font> (a.k.a. <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>) rumbled into the 
parking lot in his monster truck and proceeded to have a show-and-tell with his new compound bow and razor-tipped arrows.  
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived, so the mood lifted as <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> had the golden 
opportunity shoot <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  Wrong.  <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> mumbled something like, 
“<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> not worth a perfectly good hunting arrow.”  He might have had a point (no pun 
intended), yet disappointment nevertheless ensued.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> notified the growing crowd that four other non-regular hashers would be cuming.  
Nobody believed him (who would, no <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would not… but I digress).  Wrong.  An unfamiliar 
minivan pulled in, and <font color="#FF0000">Red Snapper</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Beyond Hope</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Cum Again</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">kraM</font> (of DCH4) piled out of the vehicle.  [Note:  
<font color="#FF0000">Cum Again</font> originally hashed with RIH3, so long ago that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
had not yet exposed himself at a hash, but the technicality on whether she was an RIH3 backslider, or DCH4 visitor was 
never really resolved.  The hash had better things to attend to, like drinking beer, but then again… I digress.]</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> arrived and surreptitiously picked up a case of Yuengling lager from <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>.  He assumed nobody noticed.  Wrong.  The hare managed to smooch off of <font color="#FF0000">
Just Nathaniel’s</font> precious beer for the rapidly expanding and enthusiastic crowd.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> arrived.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> expected to get 
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover’s</font> turtle for his goldfish pond.  Wrong.  <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover’s</font> emotional attachment to her hissing terrapin was just too much to overcome.</p>

<p>And with that, the pack took off heading southeast into Beavertail State Park.  They reached a check on the south side 
of a field, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> assumed trail could lead nowhere but east (as everyone started on the 
west side of the peninsula).  Wrong.  True trail turned out to be a clockwise bushwhacking circle jerk heading back toward 
the western shoreline.</p>

<p>With trail now heading southward along Beavertail Rd., the hashers enjoyed an inexplicable lightness of bliss and 
happiness along the run thus far.  Nobody dared say it, but all knew that it was the lack of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> on the hash.  Wrong.  Ben flashed by the pack of hashers to join and irritate the FRB’s, as usual.  And where 
there’s Ben, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was not too far away – the hash now doomed by the presence of the 
Bodisavatte, on his bike.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ben (<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> in spirit) joined the pack running along the western shoreline 
trails heading north.  Since true trail headed north and straight up the rocky shoreline, there was pretty much nowhere 
else to go, thus nobody could possibly get lost on trail.  Wrong.</p>

<p>The hare was supposed to sweep the pack.  Wrong.  He left <font color="#FF0000">Cum Again</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Red Snapper</font> in his blistering dust, walking stick and all.  Thus, the two harriettes took a falsie 
and headed east toward North Main Rd and forever lost.  Shortly afterward, <font color="#FF0000">Beyond Hope</font>, as 
straight as they come, was also expected to follow the straight, monotonous trail.  Wrong.  Even the straightest have 
moments of indiscretion and <font color="#FF0000">Beyond Hope</font> was suckered into the same falsie and lost true 
trail.  How hopeless.</p>

<p>Led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, the marks along the beach 
appeared to disappear.  Nobody noticed at first, as all enjoyed the aromatic decaying biomass during low tide.  But after 
a while without any marks, the pack turned around to find the hare.  You’d think the hare would place a check were trail 
would (finally) lead inland.  Wrong.  Well, not totally wrong, as there was a check, marked by white flour on white sand.  
But to say that it was a check would be the equivalent of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> saying his shit don’t smell.  
A resounding Wrong!</p>

<p>So after multiple twisted ankles on the rocks of the western shoreline, the pack finally headed inland along Bonnet 
View Drive with <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Balls on Barbwire</font> as FRB’s.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided to check out White Rock Rd, which only led to a circle jerk back to Bonnet View 
Drive, but who would have guessed.  Yes, in this case, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would have guessed.  Arriving at 
a check back at North Main Rd. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> searched south and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> 
went north.  They were looking for any signs of flour.  Wrong.  Marks were now set in sidewalk chalk.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> on true trail leading south, trail continued on and on and on until no arrows were 
seen.  Returning to Hull Cove Farm Road, the hare directed all to head eastward along a well marked trail (for once).  
<font color="#FF0000">kraM</font> grew weary that his wife <font color="#FF0000">Cum Again</font> was alone somewhere 
along trail.  He was worried about <font color="#FF0000">Cum Again</font> being alone on trail with <font color="#FF0000">
Beyond Hope</font>.  Wrong.  He was worried about <font color="#FF0000">Cum Again</font> being alone on trail with <font 
color="#FF0000">Red Snapper</font>.  Who wouldn’t?  Wrong again.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the hare stood at the eastern shoreline, he surreptitiously hinted that trail was north.  Nobody 
believed him, but there were, this time, marks.  So <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> played along and called all on 
true trail for what must have been a half-mile of ankle-breaking rocks.  <font color="#FF0000">Balls on Barbwire</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font> (stupidly) followed.  Thinking the beer 
check was near, they all picked up pace (too stupid to turn around and see that the hare did not move one inch).  Beer 
check, beer check, beer check.  Wrong.  A big falsie!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, giddy in his moment of hash glory, laughed at all the suckers, or what remained of 
the pack, for following the long, painful falsie.  Everyone reversed direction and headed south along the shoreline.  
You’d think they were so close to beer, nobody could bail on the run now!  Wrong.  <font color="#FF0000">kraM</font>, too 
worried about his wife in suspicious company, gave up on the beer and headed inland.  So all followed the hare south along 
the beach to where they would eventually discover the “B”, since after all, there was a pristine view of the ocean and a 
nice breeze to boot.  Wrong.  No “B”.  The hare abruptly stopped and said “Wait here for the beer.”</p>

<p>After being fooled so many times thus far, you’d think the wankers would learn and NOT trust the hare.  Wrong.  They 
did as they were told, and waited for the hare to return with the beer.  Five minutes passed.  Ten minutes passed.  No 
beer.  Who would have guessed?  Yes, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> did guess and went looking for the hare and the 
beer, surely hiding with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> giggling at the others.  Wrong.  The hare brought the beer to the beer check, as 
advertised.</p>

<p>That the hare only planted 13 beers for the beer check was to be a problem.  Wrong.  With <font color="#FF0000">Come 
Again</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Red Snapper</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Beyond Hope</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
kraM</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and last, but not least, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> absent from 
the beer check, the spirits lifted and beer savored.</p>

<p>Then a mysterious figure slowly but surely made its way toward the beer check.  It was <font color="#FF0000">kraM
</font> finally finding trail again, since losing trail only a couple hundred yards from the beer check.  Wrong.  It was 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>.  Upset over all the wrong assumptions on trail thus far, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker
</font> decided to shell the hare and surrounding wankers with… well, lobster shells.  He did not go without 
retaliation.</p>

<p>As everyone left the beer check, many complained that the hare didn’t even mark the beer check with a “B”.  Wrong.  
<font color="#FF0000">Just Nathaniel</font>, eager to finish the run, ran across a mysteriously large “B” with a circle 
around it in the yard of a Clark’s Village luxury home.  Brilliant!  Another beer check, only a hundred feet from the last 
one!  Wrong.  Disappointed, the pack continued to Beavertail Rd., turning south and back to the cars.</font>

<p>Nobody thought the five missing wankers would still be waiting at the cars.  Wrong.  They were there sitting on 
<font color="#FF0000">G@GH’s</font> monster truck (the biggest thing to part the legs of <font color="#FF0000">Cum 
Again</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Red Snapper</font>), in high spirits (especially for <font color="#FF0000">Cum 
Again</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Red Snapper</font>), no thanks to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and his 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew.</p>

<p>Giddy with success having set a brilliant trail of wrong assumptions, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> decided to 
steal a kids bike and ride the whopping quarter mile to the parking lot.  Who gets a ride with the hare?  Wrong.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> did not get a ride with the hare.  <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> got a lift – what 
a lush!  This just showed that deep down inside his heart, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> is truly a bike hasher.</p>

<p>Circle was held and much rejoicing in the form of song ensued.  All started to sing in unison.  Wrong.  Whatever it 
was they actually sung, it took the form of a bastardized mix of “The Monks of St. Bernard” and “What’s Gonna Make My 
Rhubarb Rise”.  Would the spirit of monks allow the rhubarb to finally rise?  Wrong.</p>

<p>Comments on the run included just about every wrong assumption mentioned thus far.  Total: +6.9!  Visitors and 
backsliders were punished for their inexcusable sins, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tried hard to get rid of 
hashit.  Wrong.  Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, again.</p>

<p>On-on-on was at Narragansett Café, but pizza had to be ordered elsewhere.  <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> 
dutifully and thanklessly took control of the food situation.  You’d think they’d keep the singing to a minimum until food 
arrived.  Wrong.  The relatively sober patrons quickly left, while the more drunken ones perplexingly observed the fine 
boisterous and booming voices echo inside the spacious establishment.  Pizza arrived to shut everyone up, which caused the 
drunken patrons to leave and the sober ones to come back.  After the food, a similar drunken-sober periodic paradoxical 
perplexing palpable and painstaking patron pendulation occurred again, as pizza crust seemed to make its way into 
unsuspecting beers.  Now that’s just Wrong.</p>

<p>Thus, the finest, most worthwhile, entertaining hash in the history of hashing… Wrong.  With that, yet another pathetic 
excuse for a Monday evening concluded.</p>

<p>And you thought this would be a short write-up.  <b>Wrong!</b></p>
