<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The shortest and bloodiest run of the year could
have been the weakest as well were it not for a homestretch bit of stinking
shiggy and a frigid river ford. The Harriers - </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little
Neck, Short Peck, Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> and your scribe
pro tempore, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Flaccid Member</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
- went on-out from Burrillville Middle School after allowing </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
Boom Boom</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> five minutes to do his live-hare
thing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Through the woods and along the tracks of a miniature
railroad we wankers went with FRB </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
failing to call the hounds On-On. Through bullbriar primeval tore three
stooges with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little Neck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
at the head of the pathetic pursuit pack. Meanwhile, the FRB had snagged
the hapless hare but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">remained
voiceless, all but abandoning his bretheren. The wankers in the woods deserved
to be there as they mindlessly followed the hare. Your faithful scribe
pro tempore was especially stupid: </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Flaccid
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">was running with with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short
Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">. As they passed the corner of his street,
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> predicted
that the hare - his father - would set the beer stop on the porch of their
home about a half-mile up the street. Good sense should have led </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Flaccid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
to take the short cut and stay dry. Instead, he and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short
Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> followed </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little
Neck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> through the thorny bullbriar, into the
shiggy, and across the crotch-deep river which was cold enough to keep
the Harriers hopping as they turned into sopranos. After the beer stop
the hounds packed themselves like circus clowns into </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">'s
car and rode on in with the hare farting all they way. In the Circle, everyone
had a turn with the pisspot for a variety of offensive behavior. Grinders,
pizza, pilsner and ale followed in </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">'s
kitchen. </FONT></P>
