Visiting/Returning/fuckin' Huge Backslider: Great at Giving Head<br>

Hash Shit: Basket<br><br>

The DEM parking area off 118 was just large enough for the small quaint Hash and one civilian vehicle. The Hare supplied a taste of his liquid refreshment and Bondo, like a proud daddy, displayed his latest batch of stool softener. Amish was last to pull in and had Great at Giving Head at shotgun. The two of them looked like they've just finished a weekend in a brothel and hadn't slept in 3 days. Not knowing where those hands were last, we tentatively gave GAGH a quick hand shake and we were off, crossing the road to the trail start.<br><br>

I was just pulling up my shoes when we started out and being last out of the lot, I noticed the Hare hanging back. This is not a good sign, so I watched for a few seconds to see if he'd give away a short-cut. Seems he was just finishing a beer, so I ran off after the pack. The first check sent Shemale on a trail going left, but most straight along Big River.<br><br>

I soon caught up with Bondo and OOzing as they strolled behind Bondo's only Buddy. The next check had the pack going right, but knowing this area and the Hare very well, I decided to continue straight to the bridge. Surely the trail would cross the river and I'd find dry footing over the bridge to the other side and the Beer Stop. A couple fishermen, WHO looked like they've never seen a guy in a kilt running through the woods carrying a bugle, said they hadn't seen anybody else running and no flour. It could be possible that the Hare changed his mind and found another location for the beer stop...still I ran on .<br><br>

It was pretty silent on my side of the river and I continued to make my way downstream looking for an easy crossing. Eventually I spotted the pack on the other side and attempted to cross. The mud was up to my knees and tried despertly to suck the shoes off my feet. I got in about 30 feet and decided to turn back. Pubic Housing pointed upstream and said there was a crossing not far away. I searched and searched, finding footprints at one point, but lost them quickly, so I hoisted my kilt and started in. The bank dropped off quickly and I was soon treading water in a narrow, but deep section. Sticking the horn in my belt, I swam to the other side, where Bonbo greeted me.<br><br>

He had been running with OOzing and they ran to the bridge. OOzing decided to cross and Bondo, evidently the smarter of the two, to go back. They were both off trail, but knowing the area very well too, continued on after hope was gone. Since I had seen the back earlier, I advised him to follow me. We started out and soon flour at the Whiskey/Water Stop where the pack had been wallowing earlier, and followed trail.<br><br>

Singing was soon heard floating across the water, and the Beer Stop was not far off. I joined the pack and enjoyed IPA and cheesy snacks. Bondo was there soon too, but no sign of OOzing. When the beer was finished, we started out on trail. My dripping-wet kilt was sucking the heat out of me and I wanted to get into a dry shirt so I didn't wait for the pack, but ran straight back to the cars.<br><br>

We circled up in the lot and had just started down-downs when OOzing finally made it back. The Hare received a -69 for an interesting but cold trail and loosing OOzing, GAGH was awarded a DD for cuming back, if just for the weekend, and I got Hashit because the Hash proved once again they have no intelligence. OnOn was at Marks and after another beer and food we made our way home.<br><br>
The End!
