<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>
<p>Most, but not all, of the usual miscreants showed up at the start of Rhode Island Hash #832.&nbsp; <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and his keepers were the first to arrive, followed shortly thereafter by <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> pulled into the parking lot in his little red NONO 
hashmobile.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Kneeling Room Only</font> temporarily escaped the clutches of the evil lite beer 
hash to the north.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>&amp; Baxter flew into the parking lot raising a cloud of 
dust and raised middle digits.&nbsp; There were, however, a couple of frequent hashers conspicuous by their absence.&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> stayed home intensely studying his Roget's for new adjectives to include in future 
hash write-ups.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>was AWOL in Bahston allegedly indulging in the C word.&nbsp; 
No, not that C word.&nbsp; We're talking CULTURE!&nbsp; Who woulda thunk it?&nbsp; Our favorite Paki terrorist chose to 
pass up a Monday night Rhode Island hash so as to spend the evening with the anemic, artsy-fartsy pansies pictured 
below.</p>

<p>Yes, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>has been seduced by the dark underbelly of American pop culture.&nbsp; 
Before you know it, the good doctor will be sporting tattoos, body piercings, baseball caps turned backwards, and droopy 
cargo pants.&nbsp; Sad, indeed.</p>

<p>The five of us took off to the north under the shadow of the North Smithfield Penile Envy cell tower.&nbsp; <font 
color="#FF0000">Kneeling Room Only</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> momentarily circled around in the woods 
before finding trail heading west across Route 7 and into the wooded shiggy.&nbsp; Hare<font color="#FF0000"> 
Basket</font> trailed behind with Baxter marking the checks for<font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>.&nbsp; (It was 
rumored that Rhode Island's sole remaining bimbo had started late on trail, after driving back and forth across the 
northern part of the state looking for the start.&nbsp; It was later learned that our corrupted soccer mom actually got 
lost on the way to the Yo La Tengo concert and decided to go to the hash instead).</p>

<p>Back at the start of the hash, professional hashers <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi </font>and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, like lumbering hippopotami on the Serengeti Plain, raised their noses in the air, and 
waddled off in a leisurely short cut to the beer check.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">KRO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> followed a series of trails, check, false 
trails, deer trails, and logging roads through deep woods to the north.&nbsp; They easily skirted a feeble excuse for a 
swamp shortly just before a 90 degree turkey, eagle split.&nbsp; Soaring like eagles, (or chicken hawks?) <font 
color="#FF0000">KRO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> headed up a knoll, through some thick brush and out 
onto a groomed trail.&nbsp; After a few hundred yards, we popped back out into civilization into some poor slob's back 
yard.&nbsp; After a short dash down some private driveways and a sprint across a main road, we re-entered the shiggy 
north of the gravel pits.&nbsp; Hearing <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> horn a short distance behind us, we 
followed flour to a construction site and a power line cut through the woods.&nbsp; Racing down the power line, we 
arrived at the beer check just in time to prevent <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS
</font> from swilling the few remaining suds of <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> pre-stashed beer.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>sounded his horn several times in an effort to help <font color="#FF0000">
EverReady</font> find her way to the beer check in the last moments of dusk.&nbsp; Since we soon ran out of the small 
amount of beer rescued from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, we decided to 
leave the bimbo to her own devices, and head back to the cars and the circle.</p>

<p>The hare was called into the square for the usual abuse and humiliation.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>complained that the trail was too short, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">KRO</font> complained about the lack of bimbos, and Baxter, Ben &amp; Jake complained about having 
to sniff the same old doggy butts week after week.&nbsp; All in all, a damn fine 6.9.&nbsp; The group concluded that 
<font color="#FF0000">Short Peck </font>once again must have been a mystery hare.</p>

<p>During the circle, <font color="#FF0000">KRO</font> seemed to be a little apprehensive about the missing wench.&nbsp; 
We told him not to fret, we can find other bimbos to replace her.&nbsp; After a final leisurely Swing Low in the dark, we 
reluctantly began to look for the missing <font color="#FF0000">ERSB</font>.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">KRO</font> took 
off up Route 7 in his car and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>started down the trail.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">KRO 
</font>found the <font color="#FF0000">ERSB</font> walking along the road.&nbsp; The Rhode Island Hash was no-longer 
bimboless for the evening.</p>

<p>We repaired to Box Seats for the On-On-On.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> convinced everyone to order the 
tofu vegetable special.&nbsp; About 2/3rds of the way through the meal, a pretty young lady walked up to our table and 
gave the old <font color="#FF0000">BoomBoom</font> a hug and kiss.&nbsp; What do the ladies see in the old bastard?&nbsp; 
Someone to pity?&nbsp; A resemblance to their grandfathers?</p>

<p>After the usual feeble attempts to flirt with the waitress, the old married men of the Rhode Island Hash ambled out 
to the parking lot, got back in their cars, and drove home for a dose of Metamucil and Ibuprofen before going to bed.</p>
