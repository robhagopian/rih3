<p><font color="#008000">Run #970,</font> Nov 8, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Ten-Mile River Greenway, East Providence</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 30’s, Clear and windy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr W.H.O., Async, Just Michael (unaffiliated, first hash with RIH3, 
although he ran the NERD 2004), Just Bert, Just Josh, Oozing SD, SESYB, Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, Ben, Seamus.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The d’erections specified that the hashers were to park behind the softball fields near the beginning of the bike 
path of the Ten-Mile River Greenway in East Providence. But <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, the perennial early 
arrival thought it looked a bit risky. He parked by the old Thompson School and waited. In a short time, the East 
Providence Police showed up, shined a searchlight over his car, and went for a cruise to the back of the softball 
fields.&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000"> Dr WHO</font> stayed put, and after the police left, met the other arrivals and 
had them park at the school. By the time the hare showed up, the crowd was complete, except for <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>, so they were off quickly. Not quickly enough, as <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>pulled in just 
in time to see the flashlights heading towards the softball fields.</p>

<p>The first marks were found immediately after the group entered the bike path behind the fields. A path led shortly 
east and then turned northeast along the banks of the pond. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and latecummer <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>short-cutted along the parallel bike path. The rest, led by <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>, found a most viscous and foul-smelling swamp. The waters were concealed in most areas by floating 
leaves, and each successive runner seemed to find a worse route through the muck by trying to avoid the one chosen by 
the runner in front. This was excellent. But it was too short-lived.</p>

<p>The trail returned to the bike path, and continued briefly northeast. Then it was back into the woods along a maze 
of dirtbike paths crossing and recrossing the bike path. This led to enough confusion that <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> were overtaken by the pack. There was confused milling about. 
As usual! Some tried the RR tracks or went into the Narragansett Industrial Park. Some went back down to the shores 
of the pond. There were no marks. Why? Because the marks were on the bike path! No one would think to look there. 
But finally <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> gave up on the woods and 
simply continued northeast on the bike path. Trail was recovered. They came to the Ten- Mile River where the RR 
bridge crossed over the bike path bridge. Confusion again was rampant. At last, a few half-blown away marks were 
found crossing the river on the RR bridge and returning to dirtbike paths on the southeast side of the railroad.</p>

<p>The group was pretty much together as they followed marks out into a marshy area, where the hare and the BC were 
found. Despite the marsh grasses, and swampy smells, this was actually fairly dry. The hare could have gone another 
ten yards with the beer, and they all would have been ankle-deep and sinking. But laziness is becoming the trademark 
of our hares lately (except <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, of course), so they had to make do with what they 
had. Beer was opened. It was soon apparent that there was an acute beer shortage. [Note to hare: One beer for each! 
What were you thinking?!! At least if you bring the beer in a thermos or a juice jar, you can hide your cheapness by 
serving smaller portions. Try the 8 oz Dixie cups. Not that <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> would ever have to 
resort to that!] The BC was thus quite short, with little singing, and much whining. This turned into much lamenting 
when the hare stated that trail back was on the bike path!<</p>

<p>The tale of the long and dreary run back on the paved bike path does not deserve description. So, when the dry 
and painfully sober group arrived back at the beginning, nursing their shin-splints, the collective mood was not 
pretty. They decided to circle up by the shore of the pond, and sent the hare back to his car to get some beer. The 
circle was formed. Ratings for the run were saved from a record low only by the initial swamp, and virgin territory. 
Nonetheless, the weather, the lack of shiggy, the out-and-back trail, and the beer shortage were inarguable. Total 
-6.9! Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, for incessant whining. The On On On was at the Newport Deck in 
Pawtucket, where the group mellowed somewhat, and were given a private room as the vocal effects of this mellowing 
became apparent. [Note to <font color="#FF0000">Basket:</font> There is no need to ask why there aren’t many 
second-timers when you insist on 15 choruses of&nbsp; “For we’re all queer together…” every time someone new shows 
up.] Another early ending for the RIH3, another wasted evening, for all except the wives at home who certainly know 
how to fill their Monday evenings by now!</p>
