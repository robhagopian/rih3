<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>You might just as well read last week’s trash as waste your time on this, because with a few exceptions, the hare 
just did a <font color="#FF0000">RQOB </font>move and recycled his trail from last week. But even the <font 
color="#FF0000">Raging Queen </font>wouldn’t have had the balls to do it only one week later. The hare must have felt 
that those who ran last week would have been so disgusted that they would give up hashing altogether and not show up 
again for months. He should realize that no one can remember last week.</p>

<p>Back they came to the Burrillville Middle School. At first it seemed that there would be more dogs than hashers, 
especially when the <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>-mobile pulled in carrying his own dogs as well as Seamus. He 
explained that he had dropped off the hare for the beer stop. At least there would be beer! The visitors were hopeful. 
The ones who had missed last week were hopeful. The dogs were very hopeful. The ones returning to the same starting point 
two weeks in a row were (and are) hopeless.  <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> was (like <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>) home with his wife. But Hope (like the Branch River) springs eternal, 
and they waited patiently for instructions from the hare, who finally arrived, about five minutes late. It was to be an 
A-to-A, already different from last week. Another ray of hope.</p>

<p>Having applied bug spray, ivy block and delousing cream, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO, Fuwangi</font>, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Mr. Whipple</font> started out, following last weeks marks northwest into the woods behind the school, 
just as the Newport contingent of <font color="#FF0000">EB RIPTA </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Ms. Gay RI</font> 
pulled into the lot. Advance experience allowed the FRBs to maintain position, while <font color="#FF0000">Oozing,</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB </font>fell for some early checks, <font color="#FF0000">Friar,</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>ambled slowly, chatting about old times, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> wondered 
quietly how long he should wait before breaking away and short-cutting to the beer check.</p>

<p>Trail led curving west to the eastern shore of the Branch River, where a check was missed by the FRBs but apparently 
sent just about everyone else across the river on a falsie. Following the frequent marks southwest along the river, true 
trail finally did cross, for a prolonged and annoying bushwhack along a ridge, and then back across to the path. But not 
for long, as the trail crossed back into the river, continued in the water southwest for a few yards and then turned west. 
It led up a dry, rocky and overgrown spillway, and finally came out on Joslin Road.</p>

<p>The hashers were scattered throughout the area now.  <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>and <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> were exploring a falsie in a swamp off Joslin Road before the 102 underpass.  <font color="#FF0000">Mr Whipple, 
Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> were debating their third watercrossing, assuming trouble. <font 
color="#FF0000">RIPTA</font> was trying to keep <font color="#FF0000">Ms. Gay RI</font> from getting lost from the sheer 
exuberance of being on a trail that did not involve pavement or bowling alleys. <font color="#FF0000">Friar</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> were making steady progress, and avoiding the water altogether. <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> was lying down, his back on a tree at the beer check, well into his third beer. The hare was frantically 
bugling to try and regain some order.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> finally emerged from the swamp and took Joslin to the Victory Highway. Grimly 
shaking his head at the deranged audacity of the hare, he turned east. As he had foreseen, he found marks leading to 
Walling Road. Up this road briefly he ran, and turned following an unmistakable odor. He found <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> and the beer check, cunningly concealed at the same spot it had been the previous week. Gradually the rest 
arrived, only <font color="#FF0000">Ms. Gay RI</font> lost for the moment. The beer check was jovial regardless of the 
lack of effort by the hare, and songs were sung, and the rhubarb yet again refused to rise.  [This song is growing each 
week like a giant festering and fungating boil on the bum of the RIH3. But I digress.]</p>

<p>Trail on-in was a backwards segment of last weeks. The marks traversed the woods northeast through a slightly swampy 
area, and then crossed the Victory Highway onto the rail grade parallel to 102. In no time they were back at the Middle 
School. But <font color="#FF0000">Ms. Gay RI</font> was still missing, and the hare and <font color="#FF0000">RIPTA</font> 
stayed to start a search while the rest drove over to Snake Hill Rd. to circle up.  <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat, Just 
Big Sh*t, Short Peck</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Jodi </font>greeted the arrivals and opened the taps and food 
stores. But all good things must end and finally, the lost hasher was found. He was brought back to the circle just in 
time, as the beer consumption was proceeding rapidly. When the circle was called to order, the comments and songs 
reflected this.</p>

<p>The ratings reflected several telling points: rehashing (well within the statute of limitations), <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> FRB to the BC, clement weather, and minimal shiggy apart from the Branch River. These were only slightly 
offset by the loss of a hasher, the numerous opportunities to encounter dog-excrement on trail, and the absence of 
<font color="#FF0000">Async </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.  Total: 0.69. Hashit made the usual rounds of 
false accusations and settled on <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for denying cohare status. The circle finished and 
all enjoyed a feast brought by all the participants. Volleyball was “played”, resulting in a dislocated finger for <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and significant embarrassment for the host and hare as he was trounced by <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi.</font> Another fine holiday outing for the RIH3.</p>
