<p><font color="#008000">Run #1042</font>, March 20, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Cumberland, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 30’s, windy, f*cking freezing.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Bondo Jovi, Dr WHO, Dry Foot Fairy, Fuwangi Boner, Microhard, Oozing, 
WIPOS, Ben, and Seamus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>6:30 am:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> posts the third updated directions on the RIH3 website guestbook, 
paranoid that fellow hashers would get lost finding the start and be late for the hash.</p>

<p>6:10 pm:  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> arrives at the St. Patrick’s Rectory in Cumberland.  To his dismay, 
Father Abraham was not there.</p>

<p>6:12 pm:  <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> arrives.  To his dismay, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> was 
there.</p>

<p>6:15 pm:  <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> arrives – to everyone’s dismay.</p>

<p>6:17 pm:  Somewhere along Rt. 122, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (the hare) get’s pulled over by a cop for 
speeding.  Cop agrily asks <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> why he is speeding at 42 mph in a 25 mph zone.  Cop sees 
Seamus and begins to soften up.  Cop then sees the keg of Trinity IPA, tapped, with clear indication that beer is flowing, 
and his mouth begins to water.  Cop says to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, “I’m not clear on the open container law, 
but this looks awefully suspicious.”  Cop then sees that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> is wearing a kilt (an obvious 
sign that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was prepared to offer sexual favors).  Clearly enough to rattle the 
cop’s nerves, the cop reluctantly lets <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> go with only a 5 mph-over speeding ticket.</p>

<p>6:25 pm:  Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>, and the ever-reliable <font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> arrive.  Everyone huddles around <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and his van.  Why?  First, he has beer.  Second, his <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> farts 
keep everyone warm from the brisk wind.</p>

<p>6:35 pm:  Convinced that the hare is still setting trail, everyone dispersed looking for trail.  After a few 
unsuccessful minutes, they all return, huddled together like a pack of penguins to preserve warmth.</p>

<p>6:40 pm:  <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> runs across the street to get some smokes.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> calls <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and asks where the f*ck he is.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
confesses and indicates that he was only 5 minutes away.</p>

<p>6:45 pm:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrives to a pack of frustrated, frozen, and very thristy hashers.  
Luckily for the hare, he has a full, tapped keg of Trinity IPA in his truck.  He explains why he was late.  Nobody 
listens, nobody cares.  In fact, with a full keg of beer, nobody even wants to run.  Who could blame them?  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could not, indeed!</p>

<p>6:50 pm:  The hare is off, live setting trail.</p>

<p>6:55 pm:  Reluctantly, the pack is off, thus starting a half hour late for the hash that the hare took painstaking 
efforts to ensure everyone else was there early.  If it hadn't been so f*cking cold, it may have been f*cking brilliant.
</p>

<p>Trail went north along Broad St. to the first intersection, then east along Church St.  A check was encountered, but 
trail was soon found by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> heading north along High St.  He ignored the next check, 
which led trail along the cemetary at Mcgirr St.  Then led by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, trail went into a field, 
cross the field, and to a fence.  Everyone slid underneath the gate, but <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had a little 
trouble fitting through (one wonders why!).  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> started to complain of all the pavement.  
He had a valid argument.  Nevertheless, trail finally reached the abandoned tracks along Happy Hallow Pond, which led 
southward.</p>

<p>Uneventfully, trail reached Abbot St. and led northward.  <font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> was the unsuspecting 
FRB!  Soon, trail reached High St. again and the hare led everyone on a giant circle jerk and recycled his own trail.  
Everyone suspected the BC to be back at St. Patrick’s, but this only fooled <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (not much 
of a stretch).  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> waited at the cars where a cruiser came by asking him if he was 
associated with the crazy old man in the skirt running with a St. Bernard.  No one knew the real answer, but the fact that 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> wasn’t cuffed and brought in for further questioning led everyone to suspect the 
validity of his story.  I digress.</p>

<p>The beer check was predictably underneath the bridge at John St. and only <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was 
fooled.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was too busy being interrogated by the Cumberland cop to join the rest.  Beer 
was savored while they grew cold and comiserated that the last time they were at this spot, the trail was orders of 
magnitude better than tonight.  Even <font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> complained!  Dissatisfied with the lack of 
shiggy, only <font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed the hare through some 
shiggy heading north along the riverbank.  The others conceded to the obvious and followed John St. back to the cars and 
an awaiting <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.</p>

<p>Fearing yet another encounter with the police, the hare had everyone meet at The Lodge for the circle.  By this time, 
<font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> had enough and took off, mentioning something about picking up a friend at the 
airport.  Surprised at the originality of his excuse, the others took off to The Lodge where circle was held.  Comments 
included:  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> almost arrested (horray!), <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> almost 
arrested (yippee!), no bimbos (aww!), <font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> (neutral reaction), and the mathematical 
total somehow still equaled a <b>–0.69</b>!  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.  Why?  Who knew (actually 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> didn’t know) but it was just <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> being <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.</p>

<p>At The Lodge, song was sung and patrons started to depart.  But the waitstaff were entertained, nonetheless, and only 
hoping for a good tip for chasing all the good patrons away.  Encouraged by the attention, the hashers belted out more 
songs (but after they got their food).  Yet once the beer dried up, they departed.  At least this time, nobody stole a 
cop’s beer!  Luck, as it seemed, was on the wrong side of the law on this night.</p>
