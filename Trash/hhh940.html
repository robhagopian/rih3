<p><font color="#008000">Run #940,</font> April 19, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Clear, 50’s</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Oak Hill Pub, North Kingston</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom, Dr WHO, Fuwangi Boner, WIPOS, Oozing SD, 
SESYB, Seamus</font>.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The starting point was the Oakhill Tavern in Wickford with its famed $8.99 Monday Steak Fry. Even this couldn’t swell 
the numbers who appeared for this hash. But those who did arrive were well served by the hare. Promptly at 6:30 they were 
off. Trail led north briefly on Rt 1, and turned west on Haverhill Rd. to its end. No surprises. It was straightforward 
until they entered the woods.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>-style checks were out in force. This means that the check often substantially 
backtracked on itself to a previous unmarked trail. But even knowing this was little help for these wankers. At the first 
major check it was <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> caught on first. Leaving the rest behind, he found flour and led 
west to the shore of Bellville Pond. He turned south to a check with swamp to the left, pond to the right and trail ahead 
to the bridge and path leading to Ryan Park.  <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
caught up, but refused to follow after marks ended on the far side of the bridge. <font color="#FF0000">Basket, WHO</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> continued to the softball fields, hearing calls which sounded like “On ON!” 
(Actually, they were shouting “Yer OUT!” But sight, hearing and intelligence are traditionally lacking in the RIH3.) <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> gave up and turned back. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> pressed on.</p>

<p>The crafty hare had indeed continued northwest, and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
SESYB</font> followed true trail. They were finally joined by<font color="#FF0000"> WHO,</font> only to become mutually 
confused yet again by the bizarre checks. But up ahead, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> emerged on trail (against all 
odds). They regrouped and followed the old railroad grade, and eventually turned right to cross Ten Rod Road. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were still nowhere to be seen (or heard).</p>

<p>Trail then skirted an auto dealership on the left with a farm on the right. &nbsp;Several attractive sheep and goats 
beckoned to <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. Luckily for these gentle animals, they were guarded by a large longhorn 
bull and an electric fence. Trail continued north into Coccumcussoc Park. Back in the woods and up a hill, they finally 
came to the BC, and directed by the hare soon found beer and potato chips. When the chips were almost gone, a sheepish 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> straggled in.</p>

<p>After finishing the limited supplies of beer, the on in trail was found. They continued north, entering a swamp filled 
with skunk cabbage, but relatively little moisture. It was getting dark and flashlights came out. But the trail was 
straightforward. They crossed Coccumcussoc Brook, and came to a field and truck, containing a grinning hare and more beer.
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> came in last, looking flushed and sated. (<font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>quit smoking; they might have asked for a cigarette, but were out of luck.)</p>

<p>The circle was joined. Ratings for the run were good: swamp, incomprehensible checks, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> lost for substantial periods, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. 
Total:6.9. Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, or at least that’s your scribe’s story and he is 
sticking to it. After religion, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> jumped into the cab of the truck, leaving the rest 
hanging on for dear life in the truck bed, as they drove back on Stony Lane to Rt 1. On the ride, they sang more songs 
than they have the last two or three hashes put together. And at the subsequent steak fry, food missiles and stupid hash 
tricks made their reappearance for the season. Popcorn, fries, and even a bleu-cheese dressed cherry tomato made it into 
the beers. More songs were trotted out. The management began to look concerned. Spring must be in the air for the RIH3.</p>
