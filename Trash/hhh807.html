<p>What do you do with an abandoned restaurant? Start a hash from it of course!</p>
<p>The late great Ron’s Spaghetti House was the scene of this weeks crime, I
mean Hash. The old time place may have absorbed by the Chapter 11 folks, but its
parking lot remains a central spot to enjoy a hash in the areas around Rt. 116.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill (LAM), Async, Bodhisattva Bondo, PW, Short
Peck, Oozing, WIPOS</font>, and some Navy virgin joined the hare <font color="#FF0000">(Mr.
Short Peck)</font> admiring just how quickly it gets dark in northern RI, when
on out was called. (Sadly, there was no <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font>
this week. Unconfirmed rumor has it that she met a local at Cady’s and, yada
yada yada,, now she can open a beer bottle with her teeth. If she fails to
appear at next weeks hash, it will force <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill </font>to
write a song ).</p>
<p>In his instructions, the hirsute Hare said the beer check would be held,
using vague language such as</p>
<p>&quot;You’ve been there before&quot;. <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill
(LAM) </font>turned over the lightbulb in his head (slowly), exclaimed &quot; I
know this&quot; and ran off with Baxter. The on out also interrupted a lively
discussion on the recent Boston Phoenix article about that citys Hash. &quot;
Piss drinking money grubbing bastards&quot; was heard as the pack lit out down
the road and into the wet woods on Rt 116.</p>
<p>The pack assumed their normal positions with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> out front followed by the pack of dogs
and then the other pack of dogs, on two feet. Through a cold stream, up to power
lines, and then across the road to the paths into the dark. No <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill</font>, no Baxter, no worries.</p>
<p>In keeping with family tradition, the Hare used the absolute minimum amount
of flour to mark trail. Once those two teaspoonfuls were gone, the pack began
drifting down nameless trails seeking out anything that looked white. Finding a
check, the pack spilt with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
into a path each, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and<font color="#FF0000">
PW</font> seeking the straight path. The intrepid duo, and their dogs, bickered
and sought out flour. Finding none they called out, only to hear &quot; On
back&quot; from the hare. Running back through the check, they met the hare a
distance past that and turned left trail to catch up. Despite the weather, they
still openly cursed the hare for setting a true trail that began long before the
check. Poor hare, just look at those genes.</p>
<p>Through the woods, onto a trim Smithfield suburban street (providing the only
excitement that neighborhood has ever seen), under 116 and through an industrial
park. The FRB <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>,
were joined by <font color="#FF0000">Navy Bruce</font> in the hunt for beer. The
stash was found a short time later by the hashers in one of a series of three
abandoned elf houses. After <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> finished
conversing with the resident cookie makers, stout was poured joyfully as the <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill</font> was not there! Despite claims to know the location of the beer
check, he had not arrived before the pack. Much joy was had in Smithfield that
night, as the <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck’s</font> run quickly vaulted to
&quot;Run of the Year&quot; status.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
started a grateful chant, and the birds began to sing.</p>
<p>However, all good things must come to an end, there is a war on you know.
Just as the stout ran dry, a bugle was heard in the distance. As though
choreographed, the Hash doused lights and maintained <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill (LAM)</font> silence. The depth charge of the bugle grew closer, forcing <font color="#FF0000">Async,
PW, Short Peck, Oozing</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Navy Bruce</font> to
seek cover in the elf huts. <font color="#FF0000">Bodhisattva Bondo</font> had a
more ecological idea, hiding his svelte figure behind a nearby sapling. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>,
pressing a button on his survival suit, burrowed deep into the earth, prepared
to hide until spring. <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill</font> wandered about the
elf compound on this dark night, calling out &quot;are you&quot; into the night.
Just one more crazy man lost in the woods of Smithfield.</p>
<p>The clever ruse was betrayed by <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill’s</font>
ability to spot <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> hiding behind a tree.
Incredible, how could he see through the tree with just one eye? In a small
consolation, there was no beer left, so on out was called again to a short trail
leading back out to good old Ron’s.</p>
<p>The circle gathered, down downs given to the hare, the virgin, and to <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill</font>, because he asked for one. The hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Bodhisattva
Bondo</font> who, in a quest to lay this honor off on <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>,
threw and broke the hashit into many pieces in the parking lot of Ron’s. For
that sacrilege, the hashit<u>s</u> returned to Woonsocket, side by each.</p>
<p>On on to Tina’s (or Lisa’s as the hare kept calling it, confusing the
name for the last &quot; bruta&quot; he found in there) a college dump that did
not even have a kitchen, but did have a cigar chomping guy named Jerry taking
numbers at the bar. (Am I in Central Falls?) .</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing, Async, Enema Bill, Short Peck, WIPOS,</font>
and, in a rare appearance <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> gathered for the
feast. With pizzas ordered, <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> set about
reviving a nearby TV, using lots of physical persuasion. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>insisted on watching the game on the wide screen, which he kept calling
&quot;Cricket&quot; and yelled out after 20 minutes without a tea break. <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill (LAM)</font> watched the billiard table, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
watched the door.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">PW </font>had brought copies of the <i>Boston Phoenix</i>
article about the Beantown hash. A lively discussion about the core of that
august group opened up, leading to many charges about mental capacities, money
grubbing, and their affinity for beer the RIH3 would not serve to the Taliban.
An editorial policy was settled upon for the Hash Trash. The policy now stands
that anyone who complains about the contents of the Trash will be banished from
it’s pages until <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> loses 20 pounds, or <font color="#FF0000">Enema
Bill (LAM)</font> does not expose himself to, or write idiotic songs about, any
of the female Hashers.</p>
<p>The check was settled by the generosity of <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>,
who gladly paid<font color="#FF0000"> Enema Bill </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
for the last round using the money clip of someone named Bill O’Brien.<font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> promised a great feast for the next week, part of his quarterly
&quot; Clean out the freezer&quot; program. Bring on the Pepto!</p>
