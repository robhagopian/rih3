<font size="2" face="Arial">The group gathered on the banks of scenic Tarkiln
pond, anxiously awaiting the arrival of the visiting hare <font color="#FF0000">Snot
Tw*t</font> for new introductions and old reminiscences. Unfortunately <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
arrived (with <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> as chauffeur). He informed
the group that due to an unfortunate exacerbation of his &quot;Mad Cow
Disease&quot;, the <font color="#FF0000">Snotter </font>had wandered, in his
delirium, onto a plane bound for the west coast, humming &quot;Californication&quot;
by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The ague had struck, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
explained, during the setting of the trail, explaining why some of the trail to
come might not be up to the usual standard of RIH3 incompetence. The consensus
was that this represented both 'excuses' and 'whining'.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the pack set off with a light heart. It was to be an A to B. Or not
to be. Spring was in the air. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was trapped in
a beer vat in his basement. <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> was taking on
Brookline. What more could anyone ask. The trail began to the west, crossing a
charming field of broken beer bottles, undefined car parts, and cinderblocks;
and coming out onto Tarkiln Rd, where a check sent <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>
back to his car for an aspirin, for the headache inspired by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>'s
choice of blue shamrocks for trail marks. On into the woods, northwest, then
west. The terrain was remarkable for its lack of shiggy, although it was noted
that it was all-uphill. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> periodically stopped
to adjust the hermetic seals on his space-age environmental armor.<font color="#FF0000">
Oozing </font>shepherded the virgin <font color="#FF0000">Just Dave</font>,
ensuring that he too would always take the wrong trail. Up the sides of Den
Hill, then down slightly.<font color="#FF0000"> Async </font>led, where there
was no trail. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, utilizing the retroactive
trail setting techniques so well demonstrated by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
in Lincoln a few weeks ago, set trail following <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>.
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>
followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, taking notes on this new hashing
system for the future.<br>
<br>
The trail led to a ranch house, with terrified owners in evidence only by the
occasional rustle of a curtain. Through their yard, and to Smith Hill Rd. they
ran, encountering another hill and a check. Again uphill, again into an
innocent's back yard, and again the pack was confounded by a lack of flour.
Finally back on track, they descended southwest to come upon a track with a
&quot;BN&quot; mark. Heading right, the trail was blocked by a large fetid pool
of standing water. [It was later proven that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>,
ashamed at the lack of shiggy on the trail, had brought up his inflatable
&quot;Power Rangers&quot; and &quot;Barney the Dinosaur&quot; wading pools,
camouflaged them with leaves and filled them with his garden hose using the
contents of his septic tank. But, I digress.] Ultimately, all ploughed through
the water, the call of the beer too powerful to resist. All that is, except <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>,
who chose to wank his way through the poison ivy along the path. Even <font color="#FF0000">Just
Dave</font> was ashamed.<br>
<br>
Tinker arrived in time for a beer, and a holy water sprinkling from Baxter in
his (large) capacity as substitute religious advisor. Sam Adams IPA was had, and
the virgin had his first exposure to the magnificent RIH3 choir, as well as the
joys of coed public urination. Thank God <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>
wasn't there.<br>
<br>
The remaining trail was back through the same water (make do with what you've
got) and then uphill, to the west. Little can be said about this except to note
that the layers of ancient flour, like the rings in the cross-section of a tree,
bore witness to the popularity of this approach to Snake Hill Rd. Even <font color="#FF0000">Dr.WHO</font>
could not get lost. Chez <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was achieved, and&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">Dog Meat</font> welcomed the crowd. The circle was formed.
More beer was brought from the cellar: Trinity Brandywine, which brought a gasp
from the already pale WIPOS, whose last encounter with this brew had spawned
legends in the East Providence P.D. As the circle proceeded, there was a
particularly heinous and unforgivable event: a delay in the filling of the
glasses, almost resulting in a DRY down-down for the visitor. In her
embarrassment, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> showed us her ring.
This was fine, but it unfortunately inspired <font color="#FF0000">Just Dave</font>
to show us HIS ring at his down-down, which put the pack's appetite off for some
time, and may!<br>
&nbsp;have inspired <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> to write a new chapter
in his four volume epic: &quot;Coloproctology through the Ages.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Hashit was present in two incarnations: the dreaded burnt toilet seat, and a
new, bacteriostatic and conveniently suspended portable bed pan, thoughtfully
provided by <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, [who had been awarded the same
through rank envy and prejudice the week before during his run, which I might
add was an exceptional run in all ways, and if Oozing doesn't get off his butt
and do the write-up for that run, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO </font>will
refer all his chronic pain patients to the aforementioned Oozing, so there!] The
crime of beer rationing assured Basket one of the hashits; the second was
provisionally awarded to Dr. WHO as a stand-in for <font color="#FF0000">Snotty </font>[If
someone can explain that one to me, I would be grateful.] Fortunately,<font color="#FF0000">
Trail Hoover</font> made the mistake of criticizing <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS'</font>s
fashion sense, and hence received the dishonor. She accepted in good grace, and
even ate dinner from the bedpan, ensuring a fine crust of savory spices for the
next recipient. After religion, into the house for an excellent dinner of P!<br>
ea Soup, Bread and a spicy version of American Chop Suey. A fine evening was had
by all.<br>
<br>
P.S. If <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>really wants <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO's</font> shiggy shoes, they may be had for a price (after the inoculations,
of course).<br>
