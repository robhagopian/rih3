AnyWHO, the trail set off south on Water St and onto the pedestrian bridge. Piggy chased the pint of beer with Skeleton hot on their heels! Ah, the Irish family get-togethers! Brings a tear to my aye! The hare called on whiskey check upon the bridge. As we enjoyed a we nip, bringing up the rear was a cute Turtle/Crotchtiger with a soft wee bump barely visible 'neath her exterior hard-shell.
Whisky consumed, the trail went back on Water St, south across Wickendon and past Hot Club to another check. True trail went left towards India Point park, and across the pedestrian bridge to another check, It was here trail was lost and very Wipes-like, either poorly marked, or ran out of flour! Oozing and WHO searched up and down Wickendon, down Ives but nowhere. Apparently, the marks were set "on a wooded trail" that wasn't there, and went up Brook, towards Thayer where students giggled at the motley lot, and then circled towards  Prospect Park where the beer check was.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, Preggers Nun was completely lost, and just as s/he was going into labour, ran into O'boner; and they both made it to Prospect Park to enjoy beer.<br/><br/>
The trail resumed back down towards Benefit St, down to N Main by the fire station, and back to the start.<br/><br/>
Circle was at the river, down-downs to the Hare, the backsliders Just Ian and FF. Best costume went to Turtle/Crotchy; and for some inexplicable reason, hashshit went to Pregnant oozing.
A brief On After was enjoyed at Harrys before they called the cops for the blackface Basket impersonator.<br/>
OnOn!
