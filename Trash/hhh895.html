<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The usual miscreants gathered on a warm and sticky afternoon in Blackstone, Mass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font 
color="#FF0000">Doctors Swallows, Who </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were on hand to continue their secret 
case study of the Rhode Island Hash House Harriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The Good Doctor is studying the growth of 
microbial parasites between the toes of shiggy slogging hashers, the Bad Doctor is studying gastrointestinal distress 
generated by excessive consumption of Bondo homebrew, and the Ugly Doctor is studying the bizarre behavior of xenophobic 
middle aged Caucasian alcoholics).&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">BasketBoomBoom</font> brought that buggering, 
slobbering hound of his....no, not <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, Seamus.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi 
Boner,</font> having been evicted from his digs in Narragansett, moved back into his parent's house in nearby Cumberland, 
and therefore had plenty of time to get to the hash.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Birdbrain</font>, our only active 
military hasher, was commissioned by the Office of Homeland Security&nbsp; to protect the purity of the Blackstone River, 
the drinking water source for northern Woonsocket.&nbsp; And last, but not least, three lovely young hash groupies, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dog Meat</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Big Shit</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Jody</font>, 
attended the hash to ogle the studly old banker from Providence.</p>

<p>At the appointed run start time of 6:30, there was no hare to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone suggested that hare 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> may have drowned in the swollen Blackstone River.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nah, impossible said <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too much buoyancy generated by excessive unreleased flatulence.</p>

<p>With no hare in sight, the pack took off on trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; A short circle jerk thru some nearby streets and shiggy 
led to a crossing of the Blackstone.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Doctor Swallows</font> entertained the pack with 
high-pitched squeals of delight as she waded across the thong-high waters of the river.&nbsp; Up the river bank on the 
opposite side, the trail entered some woodsy shiggy...then out onto a power line and nearby dirt bike trails.</p>

<p>The trail headed generally north, parallel to the river over a branch of the Providence and Worcester RR, and to a beer 
check in a small grove next to the river.&nbsp;&nbsp; Awaiting the pack were the aforementioned&nbsp; hash groupies and a 
pair of canoes.&nbsp;&nbsp; We entertained the ladies with a selection of charming hash ditties, then watched as the 
Boddhavista rounded a bend in the river, paddling upstream in yet another canoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that our hare 
had paddled upstream all the way from the dam at the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dogs swam out to meet the intrepid hare.
</p>

<p>We piled into the canoes for a continuation of the beer check.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pretty strong current made it an easy 
paddle back to the start.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS, Fuwangi Birdbrain </font>and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> took an early lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <font color="#FF0000">Bad Doctor</font> provided ballast for a canoe 
paddled by <font color="#FF0000">Ms Hoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Ms Pride</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third 
canoe, paddled by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Basket </font>and<font color="#FF0000"> Oozing</font> brought up the rear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seamus, Ben and Jake hitched a ride with the ladies back to Bondo's.</p>

<p>The pack enjoyed the usual <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>hospitality back in the Woonsocket home of the Rhode 
Island Hash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bondo chili and Bondo brew.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The usual hash crimes, real and 
imagined, were recognized in the circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was given the hashit for 
expressing envy of the threesome enjoyed by <font color="#FF0000">Dr Who</font> on the river.</p>

<p>All in all, another fine waste of a perfectly good Monday summer evening.</p>
