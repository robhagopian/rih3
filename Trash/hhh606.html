Async, Oozie the Sherpa, Three Bubbles Up, The Doo,</FONT>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> As is becumming common this winter, it was
once again a run without snow.&nbsp; The</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> pack was bigger than usual again this week
following on from last week's Async</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> run where we had to use the overflow parking
lot. The Hare, Little Neck, being</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> the bright one that he is provided us with
pertinent pre-run info to the tune</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> of</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> 1.This is the start and 2. The trail goes that
way and there is only ONE beer</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> stop.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> There were tree returnees this evening, the
best excuse for not turning out</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> for a long time had to be Three Bubbles Up
story about Yellow Stuff cumming</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> from where the sun don't shine. Krisco made
the trip because, as a kid, he</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> knew every inch of the land personally and
he had to see it again as an</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> "adult". The Doo was there because he needed
cold beer.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> The pack were ON at last, Basket was sporting
Robbie Burns attire much to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> amusement of the rats rummaging around the
used condoms and empty swill cans</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> under the bridge. Aye Laddie, he would not
be tricked into following trail</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> tonite. There was a high rood and a low rood
and Basket took the shortcut</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> followed by Async. Then Rusty and Krisco took
a bad trail and the remainder,</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> led by Ooozie took the lowe rood.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> Alas for some, the low road was a trick. "</FONT><B><BLINK><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>FUCK</FONT></FONT></BLINK></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">",
said Oozie "this bluudddy run</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> sucks". That moment in time was the last we
would see of that division of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> pack until we arrived at the beer stop. And
so, we found trail markings on a</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> frozen stream, frozen sand and so on. Suddenly
Basket was seen running trail</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> backwards, he tried to convince the pack that
he was right but following a</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> kick to the nuts he soon changed his mind and
gestured us in the direction</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> from whence he came. We rounded a corner and
thought we had happened upon the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> beer stop, the place was littered with beer
cans. Empty ones and lot's of</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> them, on closer examination it was determined
that this cheap stuff must have</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> been a beer stop for the Boston hash at some
time in the past.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> A short bit up down the road we came across
the hare who had parked his arse</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> atop a rock. He tried in vain to feed us with
bread and fish, he refused our</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> requests to turn the frozen water into cold
beer and sent us on our way. At</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> this stage we began to worry about the three
lost souls, Oozie, Three Bubbles</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> Up and The Doo. However, when Krisco pointed
out that there would be more beer</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> for us at the Beer Stop it was decided not
to worry about them until the end</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> of the run.&nbsp; The Hare would soon join
the pack, Basket hung back when we got</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> to Fleet, blowing his horn for the backmarkers
to no avail. We crossed 116,</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> 146 and 295 and then a muddy field. This field
would be the highlight of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> evening, it was my first introduction to flour
sucking mud. The Hare said</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> there had been a check RIGHT THERE but that
it had been sucked up by the mud !</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> Despite vain attempts we were unable to get
Basket to stand in said mud for</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> more that 10 minutes, he was not sucked in
or else the mud has got good taste.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> Async led us down hill from a check to a frozen
river, the trail went straight</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> across but he has been around too long for
that and saw the stone bridge15</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> feet to his left. Krisco didn't care about
the bridge and ran straight through</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> like one of those Ice Breaking ships, why not
he said I'm travelling in</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> Rusty's car.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> We ran past the fire station, down the hill
to the toe path and eventually</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> found the beer stop. As soon as the bottle
tops went psssst, Oozie was able to</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> pinpoint our location to the accuracy of a
GPS system. He didn't figure the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> 8foot deep river between him and us though.
Coaxing and harassing led the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> three to slither across the trees that straddled
the river. Much discussion</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> took place as to where the xxxx they had been
and how good the beer was</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> wherever they were, we finished up and ran
back to Little Neck's abode for the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> down down's in the back yard.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> DD's went to the hare for another pathetic
run, xxxx poor beer, too many</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> people and too much flour. Red garments in
the circle or Septagon were the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> order of the day, along with standing on the
picnic table. Three Bubbles wore</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> his hat whilst doing a DD and got another for
his troubles. Haxxxx was a toss</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> up for Basket or Oozie and for the record Basket
saw the return of his lab</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> coat AGAIN.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> As soon as ours frozen lips started to stick
to the Necks of the beer bottles</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> we retired indoors for a feast of Chili, Rice,
Bread and more beer. Another</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">> incredible evening of bullxxxx courtesy the
RIH3. I can't wait to do it again</FONT>
