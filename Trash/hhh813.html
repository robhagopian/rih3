<font SIZE="2">
<p><font face="Arial">Following what were unusually clear and accurate 
directions, most of the usual crew gathered in the early moonless darkness at 
the appointed location in Coventry. <font color="#FF0000">Async,</font> greeting 
the first arrivals and whining about not having time to pre-lay (because of his 
extensive responsibilities at the Barrington Ladies Guild Bake Sale and Crafts 
Fair), took off at 6:15 to live-set the trail. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Compusex </font>were alone. For all too brief a 
moment. Then <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and a virgin,
<font color="#FF0000">Just Carole </font>arrived. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, 
after circling through Tarbox and by Lake Mishnock a dozen times, finally found 
the starting point and pulled in, with barely enough time to apply the 
appropriate vacuum to the hermetic seals on his hash armor.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> was at this point in custody, the 
police having been alerted to his presence by the absent but pixie-ish
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing,</font> who had called in a warning about a 
well-known flasher who would be in Coventry this evening. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> was able to talk his way out of it by offering to provide the 
Coventry PD with six free months of the Playboy Channel on Cox Cable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At 6:30 then, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, the
<font color="#FF0000">Slammer Dr WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Surfin 
Compusex, WIPOS </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Just Carole</font> were off, 
heading WSW with GM Jake and Ben across a field of stiff reeds and brambles. The 
first check was at a road, and both north and south were falsies. The true trail 
was straight into some woods, then to a steep incline down some loose footing 
into the famed Coventry Crater. This wonder of man and nature is the site of the 
tragic yeast explosion at the former Narragansett Brewery. [As you will recall, 
although never proven this was generally thought to have been caused by 
well-meaning but ill-advised early experiments in the crafting of an India Pale 
Ale by the youthful <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>.] Behind the group 
came some lights, some squeals and worst of all a bugle call. It was
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> (travelling 
under the name &quot;Eager Beaver&quot;). The leaders ran faster, to no avail. A cliff of 
scree composed of macadam, rocks and rusting auto parts was next, and it slowed 
the pack down until they regrouped with the latecomers on the shores of a toxic 
pond, a miasma of foul odors and refuse. (Much like the back seat of
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> car.) The trail led straight through, 
according to the arrow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">An initial foray into the water by the
<font color="#FF0000">Sleeper Dr. WHO</font> did not reveal flour or footprints. 
He wisely waited for all to soak their feet, watching as a playful group of 
water rats gambolled in the oil slicked mud. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
led the clockwise group up some boulders while Surfin' Compusex tried the 
counter-clockwise route, to no avail. Confused by the concept of Bondo as an 
FRB, the rest milled around for a while until they too finally made the ascent 
to the left. A check was encountered in a stream of partially treated sewage 
that fed the pond. True trail was straight into some woods, emerging into a sand 
covered wasteland, reminiscent of the Afghan lowlands. Wreckage of buildings, 
caves, and mounds of earth abounded. Most of the group headed northwest along 
the trail, then crossing over dirt mounds into the basin. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> however had had enough of following the trail. He headed off with 
Baxter using his years of experience and short-cutting skills to become 
completely lost, only seconds from the time he separated from the group. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">Compusex</font> led, as
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> energy flagged having gone for almost 40 
minutes without a beer. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> chaperoned the virgin, fearing that
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>might return naked. They provided useful 
instructions to the newcomer, ensuring that if she ever returns to hashing, that 
she will always be able to get lost with the best of them. Meanwhile, back at 
the cars <font color="#FF0000">PW </font>and Zoe had arrived. He set out 
immediately hoping to bypass the run and proceed straight to the beer. Finding 
trail was no problem as both <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and the
<font color="#FF0000">Slicer Dr. WHO</font> had had a <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> beer before setting out. The odor they left behind them was almost 
visible. Just to ensure that late arrivals with head-colds could follow,
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> thoughtfully also left a trail of blood from 
a gash on his left leg. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Across the sands they ran, closer to the hare than they 
knew. They came to a cliff and despite lack of flour, climbed straight up. The 
scent of beer was upon them as they approached the giant phallic water tower 
that marked a site for a beer check that no hasher could ever have resisted.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, still separated and lost, saw this 
mushroom-like erection and headed straight for it, hoping to tryst with his hash 
spouse, <font color="#FF0000">Misses Enema Bill</font>. Likewise
<font color="#FF0000">PW (Misses Enema Bill)</font> was inspired to head for the 
monument for similar reasons but as he approached along the southern side of the 
woods at the top of the cliff, he encountered the rest of the hashers at the 
beer check and beer won out over romance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At the beer check, things were going well. Pleasant 
conversations, good beer, a tourniquet around the <font color="#FF0000">Spurter 
Dr. WHO's</font> leg, and general good behavior had <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Carole</font> pretty much convinced that this hashing stuff was allright. But 
like a <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> Beer fart in a crowded elevator,
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived. Inexplicably, he began to sing in a 
bizarre travesty of the German tongue, and had to be subdued by an interminable 
rendition of &quot;The Wild West Show&quot;. This sent the hare off in disgust to set the 
trail back. Beer consumed, they headed out in groups. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">PW,</font> in an effort to make
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> jealous went off alone with
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, heading northeast down the cliff back to the 
wasteland. The rest followed trail, soon losing it in the sand.
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS, EverReady</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Carole</font> fixed their sights on &quot;The Chicken in a Barrel&quot;, while
<font color="#FF0000">Surfin' Compusex</font>, the <font color="#FF0000">
Slitherer Dr WHO</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>spread out and 
eventually found trail with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">PW</font> in the blowing sands. It led to the hare who had 
set up camp in a wrecked two-story concrete house tilted at forty-five degrees 
with no windows or roof (and bearing a striking resemblance to Osama Bin Laden's 
current summer home). They made it back to the cars uneventfully. With a wild 
surmise they realized that <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Just Carole</font> were relying on <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS's</font> navigational skills to get them back. A search and rescue mission 
was briefly considered. By the time it was remembered that <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font> had cab fare, the missing ones had arrived against all odds. Also 
waiting by the cars was Tinker, who claimed to have done th! e run twice, 
backwards and forwards on bad hips, probably missing the hashers while exploring 
the network of caves and tunnels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The circle was joined and nearly disbanded immediately 
when <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> produced copies of his Nazi anthem, and 
proceeded to sing in a garbled German that would have convinced Martin Luther 
himself that God could not exist. Again resorting to force, &quot;The Monks of St. 
Bernard&quot; was begun and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was drowned out. The 
xerox copies of his song were drenched in dark beer to the point of thankful 
illegibility. The hare entered the circle. Ratings as always showed a kind 
forbearance: <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> gave it a &quot;lovely run&quot;, and in 
retaliation, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> gave a 10F.
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> rated it 
the run of the week. <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> pointed out that the 
presence of two bimbos made it worth a 10, <font color="#FF0000">The Swisher Dr. 
WHO</font> said that he saw at least four including <font color="#FF0000">Misses 
Enema Bill</font>, and the many-breasted <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi.</font>
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> sneered at the shiggy, and
<font color="#FF0000">Surfin' Compusex</font> complained about the weather and 
the shortness of the run. Overall: 6.9.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Virgin in the circle: without <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
there was a moment of confusion about who would take over as inquisitor, but
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> stepped in. This resulted in even more 
confusion. <font color="#FF0000">Just Carole</font> was asked the three sacred 
questions: she got her name approximately right, said that she was made to cum 
by the &quot;Slaughter&quot;(?), and thought the square-root of 69 was 7.3! A promising 
start for the new hasher (although the <font color="#FF0000">Simonizer Dr. WHO</font> 
has been more confused than usual since). Her down down was accomplished with a 
speed rarely seen at this sedate and abstemious hash. She started to sing. Her 
first choice: <font color="#FF0000">&quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;</font> provoked 
screams of &quot;Blasphemer!&quot;, &quot;Coaching!&quot;, and &quot;Give me another beer!&quot; Properly 
chastised, she sang &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&quot;, and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>did NOT moon her. The backsliding <font color="#FF0000">Tinker
</font>was then encircled, and briefly made fun of.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Hashit was brought into the circle by
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> in a sad and pathetic attempt to pass it 
onto another. The crowd responded to all other nominations with a hearty: &quot;Was 
ist los? Nein, Nein, NEIN! Das Hashit ist geBasket's uber alles!&quot; The group 
showed the virgin just why &quot;Swing Low&quot; is the hasher's sacred anthem. At the 
conclusion of the ceremony the hare called for the on on on at Mike's (Mark's) 
at exit 6 (not 6A) and they were off into the night for a tour of West Greenwich 
(although everyone did arrive eventually).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At Mark's the group had pitchers of Guinness and Otter 
Creek(?). Downing a beer quickly, and complaining about the smoke in the 
bar,[Imagine that! They allow smoking in a bar where hashers gather!]
<font color="#FF0000">PW</font> was off into the night, not paying again!
<font color="#FF0000">PW</font> for GM! Lisa the waitress was delighted to have 
such a charming and festive group for customers, as was Valerie, a patron who 
was uninterested in Monday night football, but was fascinated by
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and his son <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. 
She joined the group and began chatting with <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font> 
[This was a relief to <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> who had been 
sitting next to <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>as he and
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had been interminably droning on about 
Excite@home, IP routers, and subnet masks, as well as whether Bill Gates had a 
bigger penis than Steve Jobs.]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It seemed as if Valerie wanted to make an evening of it, 
sitting on <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> lap and questioning the crew 
about what they were doing. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> attempted a few 
personal insults, some racist and pro-Nazi remarks and breaking wind. He sang 
&quot;When I was eight days old...&quot; and &quot;When I was a little girl...&quot; Valerie begged 
for more. She moved around the table, advising the hashers to pay close 
attention and respect to the venerable Tinker-Wan Kenobi, and his son,
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. She ruffled T<font color="#FF0000">he Seizer 
Dr. WHO's</font> hair, sending flecks of dried sweat and dandruff into
<font color="#FF0000">Compusex's</font> Tuna melt and <font color="#FF0000">
Async's</font> Grilled California Yuppie plate. Finally, as a last resort, she 
was 'Alouetted', at which she became maudlin and said with a sob: &quot;My father 
used to sing me that song!&quot; It was only her boyfriend telling her to catch a 
@#^%$! cab that made her drift on into the night, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker's</font> 
phone number tucked safely into her ample cleavage. Lisa came over and thanked 
the group, and complimented them on their singing.! <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
drowned his mortification in malt vinegar and the evening was over. What is this 
world coming to? They left without even a &quot;Hi Ho&quot;, broken men and women, unable 
even to get thrown out of a bar in West Greenwich.</font></p>
