<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>
<p>This run was so pathetic, that it hardly warrants words.  So here’s a picture of it (just for historical 
record).  Note the monotonously straight and long trail between the first and second beer checks that was 
confusing enough to get <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> lost.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah, being true to hash trash, here’s the narrative…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> showed up early at the parking lot of the East Ave. Café in scenic 
and historic Pawtucket.  With no fellow wanker in sight, not even the hare (even though his car was there), 
the good doctor gone mad decided to go inside and promptly ordered a Guinness.  Brilliant!  <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> arrived next and joined <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> for a pint 
of Guinness.  Brilliant!  After finishing their beers, the two went outside where <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, and 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> the hare stood waiting and perplexed as they did not have the presence of 
mind for a much needed pre-lube.</p>

<p>They were quickly off, heading east toward the Blackstone River, no, Pawtucket River, no, Seekonk 
River.  And just as quickly <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> headed 
north, ignoring the obvious marks.  Nobody asked or cared what <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> could be 
thinking.  A short two blocks downhill, a check on Taft St. was reached.  Marks were spotted heading north 
along the river bank in what amounted to be 20 feet of shiggy before returning to pavement.  [20 feet of
shiggy = 0.0038 miles, but I digress]  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. 
WHO</font> took the lead until reaching the boat launch for the Dragon Boat Race, where another check was found, 
obviously just to slow the hashers for a moment of reminiscence for an event which nobody could recall 
anything.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> having not attended the Dragon Boat Race wandered aimlessly 
and confused, until true trail was discovered, obviously straight and north under the I-95 bridge.</p>

<p>The pack soon arrived at Slater Mill and park on Roosevelt St, where a brief break for sight seeing became 
necessary (running did not seem to be a priority this evening).  They continued their northward journey passing 
the Pawtucket Police Station.  [Ah, the obvious reason why <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> would have no 
part of this hash, as he would no doubt be detained for questioning and administered a full body and cavity 
search.  Being subjected to a colonoscopy exam a few weeks later, and discovering that he enjoyed being anally 
violated, he missed this golden opportunity.  But I digress, again.]  Upon reaching the small outdoor theatre 
at Veteran’s Memorial Park on the corner of Roosevelt and Exchange streets, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
immediately took to the stage and dove into a well-rehearsed performance of Hamlet.  The others ignored 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and instead focused on the check on the corner.  And for good reason, as 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> immediately skipped to the “Closet Scene” Act 3 Scene 4 (appropriate 
because it was dark out) where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (Hamlet) confronts a ghost who tries to 
prevent <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (Hamlet) from enacting childhood sexual fantasies with his mother 
Gertrude.  Poor <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> did not know which part he would have to play.</p>

<p>Nobody witnessed the outcome of <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> performance, but all were quickly on 
trail heading east on Exchange St. lead by a much terrified <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>.  A 
perplexing “MJ” check was reached, throwing <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> off in the wrong direction, 
while <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> found true trail heading north on Fountain St.  From then on, it 
was decided to let the co-hare <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> take the lead.  Duh!  The true hare caught 
up and started to make half-hearted attempts to keep everyone on trail as the pack weaved it’s way north and 
east through dark, ominous alleys arriving at Middle St. near Central St. where a “B” was discovered in front 
of Peddler’s Inn (est. 1976).  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tied <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> to 
a post outside and all headed in for a much needed beer.</p>

<p>Besides the female bartender and her permanent patron Daisy, the hashers were the only ones there.  Bottles 
of Sam Adams were opened and quickly downed.  It did not take long before everyone, including <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, started hitting on poor Daisy, the prettiest thing that would dare be in the 
presence of hashers.  All was good until <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> arrived.  The bartender, obviously 
ignorant of hashing, allowed <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> into the 
bar.  All savored their beer, the bartender offered <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> some water, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> began his typical Freudian 
slips and referred to Daisy as Gertrude.  When he started to get violently protective of Daisy (Gertrude), 
particularly when <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> tried to pee on her leg (to mark Daisy as his), all decided 
it was a good time to leave.  However, there was some hesitation as the bar offered $3 burgers, enticing some 
to ditch the run and just have the On-on-on here (just a pathetic excuse to spend more time with Daisy).  But 
being true hashers, they were off, as <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> unsuccessfully tried to sneak out 
without paying for the beer.</p>

<p>They reached a quick check at the corner of Middle and Central, with true trail heading east again and 
crossing over I-95.  Much pavement pounding started taking it’s toll as the pack started to thin out with <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> in the lead.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> quickly faded back, and some wondered if he was going to go back to Peddler’s 
Inn and kidnap Gertrude (Daisy).  A check was found on the corner of Central and Cottage streets.  True trail 
was found by <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> heading south on North Bend St.  Marks started to alternate 
from telephone poles to the side walk to telephone poles again, confusing the hashers on what was otherwise 
uneventful and endless pavement.  North Bend turned into South Bend, and the monotonously strait trail made 
some hallucinate, falsely seeing an oasis of beer.  Finally, another check was reached on Division and South 
Bend.  With McCoy Stadium close by, some wished the hare would offer the relief of some shiggy.  Not.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
lumbered south for what seemed for miles and ended on Meadow St heading west (finally!).  Meadow St. petered 
out onto Water St. where another “B” was discovered, to much relief.</p>

<p>The BC was over the birm of the road.  All had to descend a 20 foot near-vertical hill, without breaking 
their necks, into woods littered with trash, broken beer bottles, and used condoms [providing another 30 feet 
of urban shiggy = 0.0057 miles] next to the river with a schizophrenic name problem and an abandoned lot.  All 
were  there, including the hare, except for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (Yippee!).  Some half-hearted 
calls were made for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> finally re-climbed 
the hill to find him.  To the others’ disappointment, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was found and joined 
the beer check.  Apparently, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was looking for <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, who was at the BC, but everyone knew that he really wanted to spend time alone 
with Gertrude (Daisy).  Between bottles of Bass and Newcastle Brown Ales, some singing, the odor of kitty 
litter overcame the hashers.  The nasal stimulation of kitty litter made <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
have to go pee in the woods.  It was decided to circle there, and comments on the run didn’t seem to get much 
better than pathetic.  However, there were two beer checks, loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and 
meeting Daisy (Gertrude).  Total rating: +0.69.  Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for looking for 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for finding <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  Like it matters.</p>

<p>After the circle, they made their way back to East Ave. Café by crossing the river over Division St.  On 
the bridge, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> discovered a relatively clean shirt with some odd yet unique 
words and markings.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> tried to warn <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
not to take the shirt, for sure it was gang attire and probably the shirt worn by a young Hispanic gangster 
being thrown off the bridge by his rivals.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> didn’t heed to <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot’s</font> warning and took the shirt home anyway, probably to remind him of his youthful 
skin head days.  Upon reaching the cars, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> stood waiting.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> admitted that he did run for a bit, after arriving late, but nobody saw any signs 
of sweat underneath all those protective layers of Kevlar and goose down.  Fortunately for <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> he did not experience any of the mis-adventures the rest had to endure.  All went 
into the café where Guinness was poured (Brilliant!) and bags of ice were ordered to relieve the sore knees and 
shin splints from the miles and miles of cold pavement pounding.  Food was ordered, some songs, and another 
complete waste of an evening concluded.</p>
