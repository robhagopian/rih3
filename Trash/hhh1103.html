<p><font color="#008000">Run #1103</font>, May 21, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; West Greenwich, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 60s, sunny</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish Ithead, Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Just John, Basket Boom Boom, Seamus, 
Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>What a glorious hash this was, it contained everything you need for a fun evening:</p>

<p>1. Slim-jimming the hare’s truck  in attempts to score the beer while he’s setting trail – check<br>
2. Wonderful weather and landscape for trail (or bike riding) – check<br>
3. High quality, and high strength, beer – check<br>
4. First ticks of the season - check<br>
5. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> projectile vomiting into the toilet at Mark’s/Rosie’s – check<br></p>

<p>I really feel bad for admitting it, but this hash was a very enjoyable and easy-going time.  Only thing that could make 
it better would be if we had bimbos, which IS something we can blame the hare for as he drove away our only hope in <font 
color="#FF0000">TLC</font>.  It’d also be better if we didn’t have to hear <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> yapping 
about drinking Smuttynose at the top of Waterville Valley.  Over, and over, and over.</p>

<p>Hash started at the main entrance to the Arcadia Management Area off of 165 in West Greenwich, and with a small pack 
there was good promise of plenty of beer.  Unfortunately, there was also <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> but I guess you can’t have all your wishes granted.  Trail lead east out of the lot and into 
the woods with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> leading.  After a little 
bushwhacking a trail was encountered and a check had <font color="#FF0000">Just John</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> leading right and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (on his bike) going left.  After a false trail mark was 
found by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> all turned around and followed towards where <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> had gone.  Apparently his laziness had progressed from no longer running the trail to not even calling others on.  
A new low for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  A check at the bottom of the trail (also known as the back of the 
parking lot from where we started) had the pack traveling on-road north into the park.</p>

<p>After the bridge a check was found with <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> going right and <font color="#FF0000">Just 
John</font> going left.  <font color="#FF0000">John</font> called “on on” and the pack followed him, on the west side of a 
small peaceful river.  After following that for a bit the first watercrossing was made and the pack, still being led by 
<font color="#FF0000">Just John</font>, ended up back on 165 a tad West from where they first started.</p>

<p>A cross over the road had all on the east side of the now larger and deeper version of the previous small peaceful 
river.  A balls-deep cross of this had <font color="#FF0000">Just John</font> leading <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> east to a check where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> turned right, back over 
165 and into the woods.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows where <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was, and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cares.  We still had his stupid dog in tow though, unfortunately the high-speed traffic of 165 
wasn’t able to put him out of his misery of life with his master.</p>

<p>Trail led north with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> blowing his horn to ensure the others followed and eventually 
a check was encountered at a sandy intersection.  With <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> getting tricked into going 
uphill left <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> found true trail right and soon after he, <font color="#FF0000">Just John
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> came upon a “BN” and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, on his bike, at a 
bridge.  Apparently the laziness had progressed from no longer running the hash to not even calling others on to not even 
looking for the beer.  A new lower low for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  A quick trip own a side trail had <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> finding the beer and to all’s surprise tall Smuttenators were inside.  If there is anything 
we’d hear tonight it’s that Smuttenator will mess you up.  Just ask <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, he’ll tell you 
this wonderful story of being on top of Waterville Valley drinking the stuff.  Again, and again.</p>

<p>Strangely, the strong, tasty beer didn’t lead to much singing.  It did lead to discussion of <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo’s</font> feelings now that his wife had left for FL.  He proudly stated that he’s still able to please himself to 
prevent himself “from going without.”  That led into discussion on the fake vagina hashit he’d put together that’s now in 
<font color="#FF0000">Ansyc’s</font> (or more likely in his son’s) possession.  That led into <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> telling his story of drinking Smuttenators on top of Waterville Valley, again.  After completion of most of the 
first round a horn was heard in the distance, with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> already at the beer check it could only mean on thing – <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.  Soon enough he too 
arrived on bike.  Must have had a case of the <font color="#FF0000">Bondos</font>.  Once all beers had been consumed from 
the sack, and all hashers had been lubed up quite well an easy walk back to the cars was started.  I think.  At this point 
the Smuttenator took hold and the night got good.  I think <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> told his story about 
Waterville Valley, again.</p>

<p>Once back to the cars, and another version of <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> Waterville Valley story was told, 
the circle started in the woods on the outskirts of the parking lot.  Everyone agreed that the short trail was a nice 
change.  Everyone agreed that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had told his Waterville Valley story about 10 times too 
many.  Everyone agreed that the Smuttenator makes all bad hashes good.  Everyone agreed the rating should be <b>+.69</b>.  
Whoo.  After the hare did a down-down accusations for the hashit went around with it finally being stuck to <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for his lack of control when it comes to keeping storytelling to a minimum.</p>

<p>All set back up 165 and then 95N to exit 6, not 6A, for beers and grub at Rosie’s.  A table was found away from the bar 
crowd which was probably good for both parties.  I think, but that damn Smuttenator has removed the reasoning on why.  
With only one pitcher of Guinness (good thinking <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>) <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just John</font> watched <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> get woozier and woozier while waiting for the food.  After leaving the pisser, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
was able to watch <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> run in and projectile vomit into the toilet just as the door closed 
behind him.  Embarrassingly, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> had to explain to the people at the bar that <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was a member of our group and was now consuming water and that we’d hang out for a bit to 
let him settle down.  Good job old man!  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows how long we stuck around after, but soon 
enough it was agreed we should hop into the cars and head home.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> assured us that 
Seamus would take the wheel as he relaxed in the passenger’s seat, an email the following morning confirmed he was alive 
so Seamus must have done pretty well.</p>

<p>I’m surprised, I’ve always been the type to agree you can’t polish a turd, but that Smuttenator sure seemed to have 
debunked that myth with this trail!</p>
