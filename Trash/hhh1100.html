<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">The “Getting Bimbos Wet” Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1100</font>, April 30, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Smithfield, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 60s, sunny.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr. WHO, Oozing, Amish Ithead, Eenie Weenie Dick, Justin My Ass, TLC, 
Fuwangi, Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Async, Seamus, Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>This hash was doomed from the start.  The hare was AWOL and making up silly reasons why he couldn’t accomplish his 
duty:</p>

<p><i>“<font color="#FF0000">Dryf00t</font> said: I realize some of you don’t understand what it means to have this 
uncontrollable urge to follow the scent of a woman, especially <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, but since I have made 
the commitment to be here in New York for her, and unable to assume the responsibilities of Hare on Monday….”</i></p>

<p>The standard hare fill-in for the RIH3 (this is about all he’s capable of filling in), <font color="#FF0000">Basket 
Boom Boom</font> attempted to impress the pack:</p>

<p><i>“Okay, I accept the challenge. We will start from Parente’s Restaurant on Rte 7 near Bryant on Monday 4/30 at 
6:30pm.”</i></p>

<p>And that leads us to Parente’s off Rt 7 in Smithfield – you know, home to waitresses in tight pants, skirts and no 
panties which was one of the few good-sounding aspects of this run.  And what else sounded (and looked) good?  <font 
color="#FF0000">TLC</font>, the Newport harriette, <font color="#FF0000">WHOs</font> attended more RIH3 hashes than those 
in Newport.  Too bad she’s dating <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>.  One thing that did not look good was Ben’s ear.  
After having cosmetic surgery (<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> loves Ben soooooooooo much he got him a nose job and ear 
lift) Ben’s ear was taped to the back of his head, inside of the ear out, exposing the open sutured hematoma wound to the 
world.  The damn dog looked like a mummy with a vagina on the back of his head.  You might think that sounds really cool, 
but it’s not.</p>

<p>At 6:30 the pack followed the first mark leading northeast over Rt 7 with Oozing somehow leading the way.  I’d like to 
make a note that it was at this point <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font> was told “those sure are fancy pants for a hash.”  
We’ll see why this is notable later on.  Once over Rt 7 the fist check was encountered and <font color="#FF0000">EWD
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> and others went straight into the woods and popped up next to a small 
reservoir pond.  Another check was encountered and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font> went counter-clockwise with <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> in tow, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">TLC</font> and others heading clockwise.  On the southeast side of the pond another check was encountered 
and quickly passed with trail leading right on Essex St and through the field. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> leaped in the sun and light wind in a Sound of Music type way.  Not that there is 
anything wrong with that.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was close behind in addition to the others.</p>

<p>Another check came up when trail intersected with a road under construction, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> went 
straight into the woods, everyone else went left and after a few marks uphill came to a dead end which lead to a trail.  
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font>, <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">EWD</font> passed through a fence to the left and uphill prior to coming up empty on marks.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> had gone right but turned back after being called on falsely by the other group and then 
doublebacked again after <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> called him on the correct way.  At this point <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> had caught up and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and Ben where nowhere to be found.  
Same thing with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows where he was.</p>

<p>After a bit both groups merged back together and a check was encountered in the shadows of a watertower, with <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> going left (west) and once again just about everyone else sticking straight to trail which 
ended up being the right way to go.  A trip up the powerlines for a bit then jog to the west had us rounding the back of 
a technology park where lots of construction was going on.  Trail expanded into a broad path leading to a cornfield where 
the hare had told us the beer check was near.</p>

<p>Once across the field <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EWD
</font>, and everyone but the hare, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> saw <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, enjoying a frosty beverage in the treeline.  Realizing only a 12 pack was there all went to 
work polishing things off prior to the others arriving.  A few songs were sung but mainly the group kept quiet and once 
out of beer trail was southeast out of the cornfield.  For the brave.  Other, less manly men decided to take Branch Pike.  
I think that was everyone but <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>.  Boo on the others!  This was the best part of the trail.  
Shoe-deep swamp slowly turned into ankle-deep swamp slowly turned into knee-deep swamp.  <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font> 
finally realized why she shouldn’t wear such fancy pants to an RIH3 get together.  Quickly getting upset, <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> was there to console her in every which way he could.  And console her he did!  5 minutes 
later they escaped from the swamp and ended up on Douglas Pike where a quick jog south had us in the parking lot.</p>

<p>Ratings on the run were low with people complaining that the long-lost city <font color="#FF0000">Dryf00t</font> had 
requested <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to find had not been found.  The fact that the scheduled hare couldn’t even 
break away from his newfound life in NY for an evening to hang out with his ‘ol buddies.  To <font color="#FF0000">TLC
</font> bitching and complaining about the swamp.  Pathetic.  On the plus side we did have good beer and we were going to 
end up at Parente’s where we were bound to stare at something in tight clothing (girls <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>, girls!).  Total: <b>-6.9</b>.  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for some reason, I bet is was 
good.</p>

<p>Parente’s ended up being just as good as we hoped it could be with our favorite waitress wearing a short, short, tight, 
tight khaki skirt.  Two young male waiters found our singing entertaining and even tipped us.  And I guess the food was 
pretty good.  So, all in all a decent ending to a decent night.</p>
