Write Up:<br>

There once was a hash in Big River that would make all your 'stach hairs a-quiver the weather was fine we all got in line
to play WHO's mustache was bigger.<br>
<br>


We started off quick and with ease<br>

We thought this run might be a breeze!<br>

but the hares were so cunning<br>

and kept us all running<br>

following flour in search of a B<br>
<br>


The hash finally made it to  the beer<br>

and thought we were all in the clear<br>

but the jig was up<br>

there wasn't even a cup<br>

so we had to share (which was totally queer)<br>
<br>


In the end we had a good day<br>

as the mustaches came out to play<br>

but Crabby's 'stash was the best<br>

because she had it on her chest<br>

And so ended the stash hash, Ole!
