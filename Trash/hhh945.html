<font color="#FF0000">Swallows My Pride</font>.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Burrillville Middle School</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> High 60’s, cloudy with thunder and a downpour at the on on on.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> (Dublin H3), <font color="#FF0000">The

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>It was the second week in a row for hashing in the town of Burrillville (The Place To Be in the 21<sup>st</sup> 
Century!). [Note: The cost of Public Services is rapidly rising in this town and it is expected that the tax rate in 
Glendale will go up at least 9% to cover the recent rash of calls to the police complaining of foul-smelling and rude 
trespassers.] The hare actually stepped up to the plate at the last minute for the absent <font color="#FF0000">Swallows 
My Pride</font> (who has some ill-conceived notions about work, responsibility, life, etc.). So perhaps the lack of 
originality can be excused. <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> from Dublin H3 was first to arrive, and parked in the 
center of the Middle school lot, trying to pick up soccer moms and wayward girls. He was soon joined by the rest, and 
the hare emerged with instructions for the run.</p>

<p>Trail began behind the school, heading northwest into the woods. The marks were frequent, and the checks were obvious 
as the pack curved around through a marshy area west to the banks of the Branch River. But the hare had not chosen to 
repeat one of his multiple stream-crossing extravaganzas, and apart from a brief loop falsie into to river, there was no 
need to get feet wet. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>led, with <font color="#FF0000">WHO, WIPOS</font> and the hare. 
<font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Mr Whipple</font> were guilty of one of hashing’s most 
fundamental errors: they stuck with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.</p>

<p>The eastern banks were followed as the river and the trail curved back southwest. A check on Rt 102 was easily mastered 
and the lead pack crossed just east of Bella’s Restaurant and turned east briefly on Victory Highway. They re-entered the 
woods past a familiar landowner’s house. When <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> emerged however, he scented Snake Hill 
Road, and decided to bypass the BC. He led <font color="#FF0000">Mr Whipple</font> straight to the hare’s home, where they 
began drinking in earnest, and eating chips and salsa in the company of <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font>. He’s not 
as dumb as he looks.</p>

<p>The lead pack meanwhile had crossed through the woods to a dirt road near the powerlines where the beer check was found. 
The mosquitoes were fierce, but were needless to say stymied by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS’</font>s multilayered 
environmental protection.  <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> had caught up, and had declined bug-repellant at the start. 
He lured most of the pests away from <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>.</p>

<p>After enjoying some Trinity IPA, they resumed trail, through the side yard of a foolish homeowner (who had assumed that 
the expensive security gate at the end of his driveway would offer some protection from intruders. Not in Burrillville 
(The Place To Hash in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century!) as long as <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> lives there! ). Leaving 
the hare to deal with this slightly irate but confused man, the pack continued west and emerging on Snake Hill Road, 
turned south to #290, and the SCBs.</p>

<p>The circle was joined, and the run rated. A substitute hare, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>at the beer check, 
and mosquito bites were not enough to outweigh the lack of shiggy, the unfortunately good weather, and the short trail: 
0.69. <font color="#FF0000">Polly </font>was brought in as visitor, and for the first time ever, did NOT sing the wanker 
song. Unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Mr Whipple</font> did. Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for being 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.</p>

<p>Completing the circle, they ate hot dogs and sausages, and drank beer, made all the more tasty because no one had their 
wallet and so did not pay for the evening. Lightning started, along with a torrential monsoon which would have been ideal 
if it had occurred on trail. But this did not stop another attempt at the world record for hash songs. This is two weeks 
in a row where the time singing after the circle exceeded the time spent on trail by at least two-fold. Some serious vocal 
cord damage may have occurred. But this might be a good thing.</p>
