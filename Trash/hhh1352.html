Run# 1352 

On trail Basket encounters several dangerous predators (a Donkey, a Wee Ball, and a She-male). Each of these predators, clearly intending to fuck Basket, invites him back to their home for a pint. The cunning Basket declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each predator that he is the sex slave of Bondo Jovi, a man known to poses every sexually transmitted disease known to man on his monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the Bondo Jovi might pass on his diseases, each predator flees. Knowing the Bondo Jovi to be fictional, the Basket gloats thus:<br><br>

Silly old donkey/Wee Ball/She-male, doesn't he know?<br>

There’s no such thing as a Bondo Jovi!<br><br>

After being quit of the last Predator, the Basket is shocked to encounter a real Bondo Jovi – with all the frightening diseases the Basket thought that he was inventing. The Bondo Jovi threatens to fuck the Basket, but again the Basket is cunning: he tells the Bondo Jovi that he, the Basket, not the Bondo Jovi, is the most infected in the forest. Laughing, the Bondo Jovi agrees to follow the Basket as he demonstrates how sexually infected he is. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the predators that had earlier menaced the Basket. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off – and each time the Bondo Jovi becomes more disgusted with the Baskets apparent collection of diseases. Exploiting this, the Basket threatens to fuck the Bondo Jovi, which flees.<br>
