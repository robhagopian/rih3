It could have been great virgin territory. It could have been an epic SkiHash. It could have been a contender...but alas, Run of the Year is still a covid cure away. OOzing found this little gem by remembering a trail Donkey and PH did some time ago. I was unable to find the Hash Trash for it, but that's not unusual, because we have a bunch of lazy bastards WHO don't do the write-up. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, in my research for any information on this phantom Hash, I found there are many years of missing information from the Donkey Map. I will attempt to recover the great knowledge, but I fear it may have something to do with Google Maps changing data or not holding on to the great RIH3 History prior to 2016. Sad!. Time will tell.<br/><br/>
As I was 20 minutes late to the start, I was alone in the parking lot with no marks to point the way. I suppose one could blame the weather, it was raining pretty hard, or Hym Wrng Gye for parking his truck over the marks OOzing left for me. In any event, Dr WHO, WIPOS, Rusty, Just Pat, Cracker (the Wolfman) Jackoff and Crotch Tiger were already out on trail and as I climbed the bank beyond the parking area, I spied too many footprints in the snow for it to be anything other than the Hash. Their trail led around a dumpster, an appropriate start to this trail, down an embankment, through some mucky woodland and over a not entirely frozen stream. My luck ran out when their footprints joined a well packed out trail to an unmarked check. It was in RED flour, thank you Woozie for your color choice, and I found no marks on trees or snow going to the right. I decided to turn around and look to the left of the circle, with similar success. Trudging on by myself, I searched in vain for any signs of the Hash. It wasn't too long before I spied a light off in the distance. It was a solitary light, so it wasn't the pack. It could have been a local out in the woods, in the rain, enjoying a stroll with his dog or a hobo looking to steal the pockets of anyone stupid to be out tonight in the rain soaked snow. I decided to turn my light off and retrace my tracks in the opposite direction, which should take me closer to the lone hiker than going straight. <br/><br/>
I soon found a trail leading left in the direction of the light and after a few turns came upon OOzing and Crotch Tiger at the Beer Stop. SUCCESS!
Grabbing a Captain's Daughter, I waited for Rusty leading the small band of Wankers in. <br/><br/>
There was a bridge just past the BS and as Just Pat made his way, he decided that was too easy. He waded across and soon after WIPOS followed in his footsteps. We were soon all enjoying a beer and snacks and singing. OOzing pointed out how this was the perfect location, by pointing into the open tree canopy.  
The complaining about a large circle jerk began almost immediately, with Rusty saying he'd crossed that bridge twice already. As I did not enjoy the whiskey, I could only sympathize with him to a very small degree. Beers done we started out. Directions were to go through the X and follow the main trail. at which WHO immediately took a right and I followed him, sheepishly, but we turned around after a short distance and followed the pack. A set of frozen stairs was found by the FRB;s and they show us the folly of using them. We took the snowy path to the left and waited at the Circle 4 Beer to arrive. <br/><br/>
The complaining continue during remarks, as we look up into the open canopy as the Hare found the perfect spot for the Circle.  A negative 69 for weather, but turned to a positive with the choice of beers. It was so good that WHO pulled out a Captain's but replaced it for something better. I got a Tilted Barn and it was yummy. Hym Wrng Gye got a DD from backsliding and then the discussion for Hashit commenced. It was long and laborious, so I won't bore you with the ins and outs, but Hym Wrng Gye got it in the end. Comments were short and we started home satisfied that despite the Hare's shortcumings, the weather gods blessed us again tonight.<br/>
