<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Weetamoo Woods, Tiverton</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> mid 40's, Clear.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present: </font> <font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD, SESYB, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS, Fuwangi Boner, 
Seamus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>After recovering from the X-Country Ski Hash, the true stalwarts trekked out to Tiverton to see if <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> could successfully be lost again. Of course, the hare had set a brilliant run. Beginning 
from the Town Farm Playground, trail led east past a particularly odorous field, freshly manured for the hashers pleasure. 
A falsie allowed <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>to sample some of this. But trail went on into Pardon Gray preserve. 
A check sent the group in every direction: to a Wooden Headstone marked &quot;R.I.P. Ben Dover&quot; in the landfill, to a 
overgrown swamp road, to a maze of dirt bike trails on steep hillocks. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> was first to 
recover and continued east into the Weetamoo Woods. Trail south was found by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> (his 
first and only correct choice of the evening).</p>

<p>The group went over a steep boulder, and came downhill to a check on the bank of the Borden Brook. True trail was found 
after some regrouping to bushwhack and follow the banks of the brook south. The trail became mostly toilet paper, attached 
to thorns. The ground became swampier with thawing remnants of the winter's ice offering a fifty-fifty shot at getting feet 
wet. There was much wailing and moaning from <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and surprisingly little commentary from 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. A trail was crossed, the check sending <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> left  
(wrong!) and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> right (wrong!) as <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> continued to bushwhack straight into the proper cedar swamp.</p>

<p>A most satisfactory and soggy swamp crossing led to High Rock, where a falsie led up to the top. Most climbed up, 
remembering that this was where <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> had been lost (on the last hash before 9/11). But true 
trail led southeast, and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>rapidly passed FRBBBBBBB SESYB into the lead. A gas pipeline 
was reached. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>checked right (right!).  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> checked left 
(wrong!). But <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> was so insecure at this point that he backtracked all the way back to 
the hare (who wasn't giving any hints this time).</p>

<p>Finally heading southwest, they turned west at an 
arrow into some fields.<font color="#FF0000"> Fuwangi</font> led. He followed a true trail arrow painfully through some 
thorns while the rest walked 10 yards further on and took the path. The trail turned northwest across a field to a stream 
that was crossed to the BC. Only <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>went 30 yds downstream to cross on some rocks. The rest 
followed the hare and forded the knee-high water. Beer was Magic Hat &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or a Pennsylvania 
microbrewery &quot;Seven Hops Infusion Ale&quot;.</p>

<p>After beer, a brief bushwhack west and the group turned north. A few checks later and they turned through a thorny path 
into the landfill, where the marks were obscured by the thousands of white plastic bags strewn around. Along the rim of 
the landfill, trail led through some particularly foul and festering standing water before turning west up and out on the 
access road. As always, a semi-functional bicycle was found and ridden by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>back to the 
cars.</p>

<p>The circle was formed and nothing but praise could be heard. If it had not been for the unfortunate fact that <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> did not in fact get lost, it would have been a perfect 10, but the hare had to settle for a 
0.69. Hashit: to Basket, of course.</p>

<p>The On On On was at A-1 Pizza in Fall River, in the middle of a darts tournament. Actually it could have been a 
&quot;Guess the Weight&quot; contest or a chain-smoking event equally. But none of the hashers wanted to return to Li'l 
Bear, so they got what they deserved.</p>
