color=#000000>It was the actual birthday of Robert Burns (b. Jan 25, 1759), so 
most followed the hare’s guidance and wore a kilt. Even the forewarned virgin, 
the two-timer Just Rich had created kilt. (Not authentically worn, unfortunately 
for those on trail behind <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Jocelyn</FONT>.) Even <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Rich’s</FONT> dog was sportin’ a plaidie. Those that didn’t 
felt ashamed. Except <FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT>, who seemed oblivious to 
it all. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, probably stopped for transporting 
hazardous materials (the Haggis), was late, and the now cheerful pack was off 
promptly at 6:30.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The rain stopped just as the group started, but its effect were 
felt along the trail. A check was encountered at the entrance to the bike path, 
and sent half the pack east towards the harbor before they realized that there 
were no marks that way. Back on the bike path heading northeast, they soon found 
that the bike path might better be called the bike pond, as the rains had left 
6-9 inches of water in the long low spots. Marks could be seen underwater, if 
you knew where to look.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The lead pack found an arrow turning left. Through a hole in the 
fence they went, and were well into some fine briars and mud, when they noticed 
the hare’s flashlight following them on the bike path. They could have just kept 
on, but they wimped out and turned back. After a while, another arrow sent them 
right. A brief bushwhack, and then the kilties got wet in earnest, as they 
forged across a swollen stream east. Trail led out to a path along the shore, 
and after a few checks, to the main path out to the 
point.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> stuck to the 
hare like leeches, and were able to skip this part. Too bad for them. The trail 
looped around the point, crossed a pond that hadn’t been there at 6 AM that day, 
and followed a deer path through the phragmites. This path was notable for 
having 4 inches of water over 1 inch of ice over 6 inches of ice-water. Lucky 
bastards! </FONT></SPAN><SPAN

color=#000000>The hare led <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> back a short distance on the main trail and then 
north to the only point of high ground in the area. Obviously the beer stop. 
They settled down to wait for the rest. With a beer, of course. Gradually, they 
all straggled in, and picked their way through the briars up the hill. There was 
plentiful beer, and savory snacks and everyone was in fine voice. And <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> wasn’t there. Oh, happiest of 
hashes!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>The way back was through a sweetly scented pine-grove, with just 
enough briars to make it enjoyable by all. Trail led back to the main path, and 
then to the bike path where a surprising number showed their disorientation by 
going the wrong way. Realizing their error, they turned back and all followed 
the bike path southwest to the cars. Unfortunately they found <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> waiting for them. Not a kilt had he either, just a 
particularly unfortunate pair of plaid trousers. But the discerning among them 
could detect the fine smell of the Haggis coming from his car. Or was it dogshit 
on his shoes? We may never know, for sure.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

to the cars. The run was rated. Plentiful shiggy, river crossing, 
water-ice-water, and no <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Hash of the year! 
Total: +69! Backsliders, two-timers and virgins were brought into the circle. No 
rings, a few lame jokes and maybe a song. Hashit went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Shemale Man</FONT> for running the hash shirtless in a plaid 
miniskirt to the disgust of all present. And he somehow lost his BVD’s during 
his punishment, and ran around the circle showing off his shortcomings to 
everyone’s dismay.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>After the closing hymn, they headed for the Oakhill Tavern. 
Initially, there<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>was some concern 
about the Haggis. But the hare managed to sweet talk the waitress and owner into 
allowing a wee snack, seeing as the array of kilts was so enticing to the other 
patrons. The steaks were cooked inside by the establishment, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> piped the Haggis in with style. No Kilt-costume 
malfunctions occurred (although the hare got a few strange looks in the men’s 
room as he lifted and let fly), and they may even let us come back some 
time.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
