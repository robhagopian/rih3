<p><font color="#008000">Run #964</font>, Sept 27, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dr W.H.O.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Tiverton High School</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 60’s, Clear.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, Oozing SD, Tinker, Fuwangi Boner, 
Just Drew, Just Josh, Evil B*tch RIPTA, Ms. Gay RI, WIPOS, Seamus, Ben. <font color="#0000FF">Visitor:</font> 
Flounder (Waukesha H3).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hash began in the parking lot of Tiverton High School, a site perhaps ill-advised considering the fact that two 
of the hare’s daughters were still playing field hockey on the back fields. But the hare is nothing if not cautious, 
and had not used any white powder within a ½ mile radius of the school. The group gathered and as usual were off 
promptly at 6:30, heading north on North Brayton Rd.</p>

<p>The first mark was a true trail arrow, turning right into the woods. Without a check, the group spread out at first 
as they ran on a grassy water pipeline northeast. But the first check sent most off on a prolonged falsie west, and by 
the time they returned, they were together again. A second check had <font color="#FF0000">Just Josh</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Drew</font> heading for the power plant, but the rest deciphered it and came out to the gas 
pipeline, heading northwest. The next check sent <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> ahead with <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font>, on a dirt road below the power plant, and then into the woods northwards.</p>

<p>The first swamp was encountered by the FRBs on a falsie just before Rt 24 was reached. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi, 
Async, Just Josh, Just Drew, WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>were suckered. This allowed <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EB RIPTA </font>to take the lead on true trail towards the 
powerlines. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> tried the powerlines south, but the hare has temporarily foresworn 
powerlines due to concerns about the effects of EMR on all the artificial parts of the aging hashers. Thus <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>again grabbed the FRB spot and turned northeast on an abandoned logging road which led to 
a familiar swamp.</p>

<p>The going was slow through this muck, and the pack was together through this and the next obstacle, a mucky stream 
bed. Finally back on dry land, trail emerged again on the gas pipeline and turned through yet another swamp onto a dead 
end road which led to a check on Eagleville Rd. This was rapidly mastered and the pack turned into a path south into 
the woods, and up to a rock with a “B”. But finding the beer required the hare (even though <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing </font>had been hiding in the bushes 2 feet away from the beer, waiting to say: “Boo!” to someone. What a wag 
he is!).</p>

<p>The beer was opened, and spiced peanuts offered. The rhubarb refused to rise again. But no one was lost, and the 
hare took off with a five minute head-start to set the remaining trail. He had planned to circle outside the environs 
of the High School, and needed time to set up. He obviously didn’t need the full five minutes, because he sat at the 
circle site for over a half hour before anyone appeared.</p>

<p>The trail led back out to the gas pipelines and south east, past the power plant. A check sent <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> into the woods west. He gave up after three marks, and returned to the gas pipeline trail where <font 
color="#FF0000">Flounder </font>the visitor offered direction. Apparently, the reason he was in&nbsp; town was to 
provide an insurance assessment for the Tiverton Schools, and he knew that the gas line ended at the Tiverton Middle 
School. So off went <font color="#FF0000">Async, Bondo, Oozing, Just Josh, Just Drew </font>and <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font> to visit another Tiverton school (the hare only has one daughter in this school).</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket, Fuwangi, EB RIPTA, Ms Gay RI,</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> found 
the well-marked trail back to the water line, and saw a ghostly orange flag in the distance: a backlit Chinese flag 
from the dragon boat races that marked the circle. They waited briefly and in fact, <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Josh</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Drew</font> figured it out, and backtracked to the circle. Enough time 
wasted, the circle was joined. Ratings for the run: too short, poor weather, reused trails and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> at the circle could not outweigh the prolonged falsies, the four swamps, extensive loss of hashers, and 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> missing the circle. Total: 6.9! Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo! </font>Why 
not!</p>

<p>They returned to the cars at a walk to find that <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had skulked off in disgust,
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had nearly been arrested by the Tiverton PD and things were going perfectly for 
the hare. Run of the Year! On On On was at A-1 Pizza in Fall River, another spot transformed by the anti-smoking laws 
in Massachusetts. It just doesn’t get any better than this.</p>
