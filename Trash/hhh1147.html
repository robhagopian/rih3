 </p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">This will be a 
short one. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> could remember anything about this hash, anyways? 
The most memorable part was the poor choice of parking places for the start, at 
the side of the road at the junction of Ten Rod Rd and Sunderland Road, in 
Exeter. But the hare had few other choices, and was so desperate for virgin 
territory that he had to make do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The few arrivals 
started off per directions, northwest up the road to a clearing. Turning in to 
the right, a check was encountered. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> chose 
wrong, and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> led southeast on true trail, through 
an overgrown path through the dense briars back to the cars. Well, the cars 
could be seen, but not approached, ensuring that those easily tempted would not 
get off that easily. Trail curved east.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">At this point, 
the trail curved north and some confusion allowed <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
to get lost, <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> to catch up with FRB <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, and all to fall for an annoying counterclockwise 
circle jerk. A branch of the Queen’s River was easily crossed, and soon 
thereafter crossed again. As has lately been the case, feet remained dry. 
Pathetic! It seemed as though the marks were crossing themselves, and the hare 
soon declared himself mightily confused. “This is where I got lost setting the 
trail!” he claimed. Great! But just as it seemed that nothing could make this 
worse, the pack came around a turn to encounter: …<FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! FRB! Shite!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Finally a series 
of zig-zag checks leading north allowed <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> to resume 
the lead. He came to a cell-tower. A”B” was found. Quickly he backtracked, 
calling “False Trail!” <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>for once believed him, 
and would have ranged up into North Kingston had not <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> shown mercy and called him back. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>A few songs were sung, even without 
newbies to show off to, and beer was consumed.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">On back trail 
was straight south, on an overgrown dirt road parallel to Sunderland Rd. Trail 
was uneventful, and emerged at the clearing, where the hare went off to get his 
beer and car so they could circle up. Ratings: Virgin territory, good briars, 
but dry feet, no one lost and no bimbos: -0.69<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Hashit went to 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, of course, for the heinous crime of calling 
Basket back. Having finished in good time, off they went to the On On On at the 
Oak Hill Tavern, where the steaks were grilled and the small group was 
well-behaved. Pathetic.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
