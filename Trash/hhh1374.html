Hash Shit: Basket or was it AssQUACK<br><br>

As is customary for a WIPOS trail, there was no hare at the start of the run but there was an arrow that pointed directly to the middle of two roads. This was going to be a Bike Hash or BASH, so a little extra trail wasn’t a big deal because it didn’t involve any running. Extra bikes were on hand courtesy of the Bondo truck, covered in an advertising wrap about some beer that will “clean you out”.<br><br>

So, promptly after we finished some Bondo brew the pack of 10 put the bikes into turd gear and commenced on a journey throughout this scenic and expensive part of RI. We wandered down Matunuck Beach Rd, passing the soon to be visited Tara’s Tavern which was located right beside the infamous Ocean Mist. What were we following? How would the late cummers know what to do? Basket and She Mail had figured it out; it’s a pink postage stamp trail with post it notes affixed to utility poles, WHO would have thought of such an idea. Out of due consideration Rusty packed a stick of chalk, just in case Donkey showed up, pack arrows were marked on the street at checks (three pink squares on a utility pole) and on we went meeting an intersection at Cards Pond Rd where the smart ones took a left. Another check at Moonstone Rd had the entire pack heading to the beach in search of the elusive BN, alas a Bad Trail ensued, and Bondo was heard to say (at least 10 times) but there is a mark over there.<br><br>

Basket led the pack like some Loon looking for an Olympic medal, the rest of us just dropped into his slipstream and continued to watch him work way too hard, a sighting of WIPOS was rumored and he was heading in the opposite direction in his car. We continued to Green Hill Beach Rd for a beer stop, this was the 5 mile marker (per Map My Run) and the turnaround point. It took a while to find the beer but Assquack and SheMail sniffed it out, Basket was somewhere in the corn fields, Bondo had some brew in his water bottle holder, Pussy Galore and Crotchy were waiting for the good beer to come to the top of the beer bag and soon they were awarded for their patience. WHO stood around like WHO’s do. The hare made an appearance and almost walked on by had it not been for Bondo blowing his new horn.<br><br>

We were about to head back, the pack split and most went to Moonstone Beach for pre-mixed Margarita’s and some hard licker. The circle finally formed back at the Deep Hole and Just Keri and Wee Balls were seen for the first time, they didn’t see the pink stuff and went for a ride instead.<br><br>

It was still bright but darkness was almost upon us, this must have confused Oozie as he watched the trunk of his car close with the car keys laughing at him as it shut. Panic ensued, and after breaking into his own vehicle he found that the smart German technology had locked everything down as tight as a camel’s arse in a sandstorm. Our friends at AAA were called and towed his car the 60 miles back to Providence.<br><br>

The run got a rating in the positive, nominations for Hash Shit included Bondo, for failing to show up for his own run last week, Basket for wearing Black Speedo Spandex Cycling Shorts over his black underwear, and SheMail for stealing Rusty’s bike at the beer stop and Assquack for something that slips the mind.. Basket was presented with the award, for just cause.<br><br>

The on after was at Tara’s Tipperary Tavern and we were served by an Irish guy with the real name of Paddy hailing from Donegal, he pronounces 3 by saying “Goan Jimmy, you want me to say tree” Why?  Next thing you know, Fuwangi walks in, first of the day Jimmy, and it was dark!!<br><br>
