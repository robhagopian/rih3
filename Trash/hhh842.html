<p><br><font color="#0000ff">The Run</font>:</p>
<p>As any frequent hare knows, sometimes the best planned and laid trails can get totally FUBAR.&nbsp; Other times, you 
can wing a trail and get a 10 on the Bondo scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, you can be like WIPOS.&nbsp; WIPOS laid a bike 
hash across the border in the Nutmeg State in beautiful virgin territory.&nbsp; WIPOS laid the trail across the border 
into the Ocean State up to the summit of Jerimoth Hill.&nbsp; His trail then entered the shiggy for some great downhill 
double track.&nbsp; The only trouble was nobody followed trail.&nbsp; At least not the way the hare had intended.</p>

<p>You see, the Armored Plated One was too busy wanking out on trail on a gorgeous Monday evening to bother returning to 
the start in time for the pack to be off.&nbsp; So Async, Oozing, Bondo and Basket struck off at 6:31 PM for parts 
unknown.&nbsp; Oozing and Basket headed east for some quality time alone together.&nbsp; Bondo and Async headed west, 
soon found flour and rode across the west dam of Killingly Pond and onto a dirt road.</p>

<p>The Boddhavista and the Webmaster continued to follow flour down wooded roads, down occasional falsies to the left and 
right, eventually to the RI/CT border and back into Patrick Kennedy's congressional district.&nbsp; A large &quot;B&quot; 
and an arrow was soon encountered, and the trail led past an abandoned house in the woods and out onto a rocky peninsula 
on Killingly Pond.&nbsp; For once, WIPOS' beer stash was easily found, and Async and Bondo settled in for, by far and 
way, the most scenic beer check of the year.&nbsp; The temp was about 70, the sun was still above the green hills.&nbsp; 
The hare had thoughtfully laid out some beach chairs.&nbsp; A kayaker in the distance paddled across the pond.&nbsp; No 
Basket, no dogs and no angry homeowners in sight or sound.&nbsp; Awesome.&nbsp; We just needed a couple of bimbos.&nbsp; 
Much to our dismay, the only bimbo that arrived on the scene was Oozing.&nbsp; He had ditched Basket and Baxter and 
followed Async and Bondo clockwise around the pond.</p>

<p>After watching the sun go down behind the hills, we reluctantly got back on our bikes and continued following trail.
&nbsp; After riding through a couple of large murky puddles, we came across another &quot;B&quot; near a large beaver dam 
across one of the outlet brooks from the Pond.&nbsp; Yahoo!&nbsp; We searched high and low for the hidden stash.&nbsp; We 
looked under the road, under the dam, in the bushes, up in the trees.&nbsp; No beer!&nbsp; After some grumbling and 
whining, we got back on our bikes to resume trail.&nbsp; At that moment, the hare appeared from the shadows from the 
opposite direction!</p>

<p>WIPOS said we were off trail.&nbsp; &quot;But we followed trail the whole way here!!&quot;, we protested.&nbsp; It 
seems that we had been following trail backwards.&nbsp; The Man of Many Arctic Survival Suits had laid trail 
counter-clockwise around the pond.&nbsp; But since we're predominantly right handed and the hare wanks with his left, we 
got our signals crossed.&nbsp; At the hare's direction, we re-traced our route back to the cars.&nbsp; As we arrived back 
at the cars, Baxter appeared in the distance.&nbsp; The St Bernard was towing his old man back to the start.&nbsp; 
How embarrassing.</font></p>

<p>We circled up down the road on the small causeway thru the small ponds below Killingly Pond.&nbsp; After the usual 
hash religion was administered, the sacred Hashit was awarded to Oozing for unspecified crimes against the Hash.</p>

<p>The On-on was at held at a pizza joint about ten miles east on Route 101.&nbsp; When we arrived, we hauled the 
remainder of WIPOS' beer over to an adjacent closed ice cream store, and directed the hare to retrieve pizza for us.
&nbsp; The usual erudite conversation and sophisticated intellectual discourse ensued.&nbsp; Ooozing tried to start 
another political discussion, but for the most part, we ignored his usual whimpering liberal ramblings.&nbsp; We 
Americans prefer to remain blissfully ignorant of world affairs.&nbsp; What can possibly be more important than the 
affairs of the Hash?</p>

<p>On On!<br>
