<p><font color="#008000">Run #1039</font>, February 27, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing SD</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Easton, MA</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low teens, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; SESYB, Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Amish It Head, WIPOS, Seamus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>On cold, blustery evening with the snow almost gone, those who are the most desperate and pathetic members of the RIH3 
gathered half-way to the north pole. The hare had set trail across the frozen tundra of Massachusetts’ far north (in Rhode 
Island terms). The site was a park that had been considered in the past, but ruled out as being TOO FAR away. But with all 
the recent virgin runs, this hare was desperate to compete. Or perhaps just to get away with small quantities of inferior 
beer.</p>

<p>At any rate, slightly late (in the hope that they could get arrested before setting off into the wind) they started. To 
find that the trail marks were near-invisible lightly tinted patches of reddish-orange flour on the sparse snow. They let 
the color-blind <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> lead. This was a brilliant choice. The marks, such as they were, had 
to be individually pointed out by the hare who pretended outrage that no one could see them. Trail led west on Bay Road 
Lane.</p>

<p>They ran on this straight and flat road for a mile and a half. The frozen ground made it as hard as pavement, so the 
hare was already losing the few points he had gained by making the marks invisible. Some checks led to meaningless trips 
into the adjoining fields. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> pressed on, blind and dim-witted, yet determined. Finally, 
after passing the farmhouse, and the last parking gate, a check led to trail on the edge of the lower Leach Pond. Now 
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led, turning slightly north of west.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> arrived late. He arrived lost. He parked at the visitor’s center on 
Massapoag Ave, (the opposite side of the park) and headed in, looking for marks, and listening for horns. Unfortunately 
for him, there were no visible marks. Even when he stumbled onto the trail.  And with no visible marks, there’s no reason 
to be blowing a horn, is there? It was one of the quietest hashes of all time. But well-shielded with <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>-Armor, he comfortably jogged deeper into the woods.</p>

<p>The main group remained together. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, sick of not finding any marks, sent the hare 
ahead to reset his trail. This was helpful. Especially because the hare had chosen to wear super-reflective tape on his 
running clothes. All his efforts to hide and mislead the group were foiled. A light anywhere NEAR the hare lit him up like 
a Christmas tree! They crossed the Poquanticut Brook on a bridge. A check turned them northeast on the Pond Walk.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led, and they soon came to a check. <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> tried left, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went straight. <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> studied one of the convenient trail maps present at ALL intersections in 
this well-mannered wilderness. Even <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> couldn’t have become lost here! The choice was 
follow <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> into the woods northwest (with the hare) or to continue northeast to the trail 
between the Upper and Lower Ponds (and an obvious beer check). The second option meant following Basket! They turned 
northwest with a sigh. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> reversed course and followed. The sigh became a groan.</p>

<p>They followed the Westside Trail uphill, and over rocky terrain. A quick review of the map at the next intersection 
sent them together right on the French Trail. Each check was easily mastered, usually with the help of the map, so it was 
without difficulty that they completed the loop back to Tisdale Road via the Split Rock Trail and the Lower Loop. The hare 
was missing at this point. Unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was able to hear the noise they made. He 
joined up with the group on the Pond trail, his flashlight temporarily causing some confusion, as it was misidentified as 
belonging to the hare.</p>

<p>But after consulting a map for one final time, they turned back and correctly chose the Pond Walk as it ran between the 
ponds (to the obvious beer check). This was found with the hare, at the bridge over the outflow for the appropriately 
named “Pud’s Pond”. Beer choices were described by the hare as “black” or “not-so-black”. Avoiding questions about what 
brand of beer is a sure sign of a lapse in quality. And so it was!</p>

<p>The cold basically aborted any prolongation of the BC or the singing. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> was first to 
start shivering, so she left alone, with directions for two alternatives from the hare. “Bob’s Trail is shorter” he 
declared. Off she went into the woods. The rest filled their cups and started walking south on the Pond Walk. They came to 
the farmhouse, and turned left for the leisurely mile back to the cars. Arriving, they expected to find <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> warm in her car. She was missing! Now this is a true dilemma! <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> missing? No problem! Run away as quickly as possible. But one of our only 
remaining bimbos? Someone must go to the rescue!</p>

<p>The hare was busy making excuses as to why he shouldn’t go, when a light was seen coming south on Bay Road. <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> had lost track of Bob’s Trail and had made it back to the road by following some lights. With 
relief, the circle was formed (on Bob’s Trail). Ratings for the run: no shiggy, no one lost, weak beer, and pavement-like 
dirt roads outweighed the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. Total: 
<b>-6.9</b>. Hashit: left with an undeserving <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, for the crime of actually bringing it 
back into the circle, and because everyone was getting too cold to argue any more.</p>

<p>Circle ended, the hare was forced to drive <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> to the other side of the park to collect 
his car. The rest followed <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> as he led them on Rt 123 towards Rt 24 and a decent “Irish” 
pub called “Owen O’Leary’s”. (The fajitas were the most “Irish” thing on the menu, but they had some pretty good Natick 
microbrew stout and IPA in pitchers.) No singing, no food-in-beer, and no shenanigans with the waitress. This hash is 
getting old and decrepit. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> can’t think of any valid reason to keep coming back each week, 
but somehow, it keeps happening.</p>
