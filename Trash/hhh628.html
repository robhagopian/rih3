<BR>Subject: Re: shiggy with Bondo??? an underview
<BR>Date: Tuesday, June 16, 1998 9:56AM

<P>Necker rarely shows his bulging gut anymore, now that he's got a steady
<BR>lay.&nbsp; She did ask him why he wasn't going to Tittsburgh, and that
it would be
<BR>all&nbsp; right with her.&nbsp; I think the magic is rubbing off on
her part, and it
<BR>will be only a short time before she kick's him out on Monday nights...if
just
<BR>for the quiet.

<P>Bondo's hash lived up to its billing.&nbsp; After 8 inches of rain in
2 days,
<BR>every trail was a river and every stream was a live threatening adventure.
<BR>The air was relatively warm, but after an hour and a half on trail
the body temp
<BR>was down to air (about 70).&nbsp; All penis's were but specks on the
body, and
<BR>only Shine On's nipples showed any increase in size.
<BR>Yes, Shine On was there, as was Tinker, and having just arrived from
<BR>Thailand, he used his friendship with the hare to find a walkers trail
to the
<BR>beer. Ooozing, Shine On, and Basket did the required circle jerk around
the
<BR>pond at Joe's Rock, but not realizing what it was, looked for further
trail in
<BR>the woods.&nbsp; We crossed many thorn encrusted shiggy pits, apple
orchards
<BR>awash with flood, and finally bushwhacked a mile or more to finally
return to the
<BR>start, where an arrow pointed across the street to the start of the
true trail.
<BR>I had lost Shine On and Ooozing in the wood, left a sign that I had
<BR>returned, ran back up the hill to call them in, and finally started
out on trail 1
<BR>1/2 hours after the start.&nbsp; Moments later as I was blowing horn,
the
<BR>familiar return of Bondo's horn gave me hope that beer was not far.
<BR>Disappointment came quickly as I found the wankers walking in, 2 beer
left out of the 8
<BR>home- brews brought in, and 2 fairly happy wet hashers barely willing
to share
<BR>their last beer with me.

<P>We arrived back at cars and found no Shine On or Ooozing, so a search
<BR>party ensued.&nbsp; I ran back up that fucking hill for the third time
tonight,
<BR>while Bondo drove the street like a whore in heat.&nbsp; The wankers
finally
<BR>arrived, having made the entire trail and found no beer at the beer
stop.&nbsp; We
<BR>started changing into dry clothes and as I stood watching Shine On
rubbing
<BR>Poison Ivy lotion over her perky breasts, my thought ran back to Pittsburgh.
<BR>Somehow in the rain, cold night air, those perky breasts with nipples
out an inch
<BR>seemed almost inviting in that Bondo beer haze.&nbsp; Then thoughts
of Worm having
<BR>his mouth around them, even so very long ago, and disgust ran though
my
<BR>body.&nbsp; I vomited, and returned to normalcy.&nbsp; Thank God I
still have my self
<BR>respect.

<P>Love Basket
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My dear Basket,

<P>You pathetic d*ckhead. My glorious nipples were never in the mouth of
<BR>the Worm. You need another excuse for your uncontrollable gag reflex,
<BR>and it is not I. The infamous encounter to which you refer did not
<BR>involve such tawdry misdeeds such as nipple sucking, thanks only to
my
<BR>virtuous will power and a certain intuitive aversion to involving myself
<BR>with a drunken lecher.

<P>In defense of the slight indulgence I did allow myself, I did not know
<BR>at the time that Mr. Worm was married, otherwise even the face-sucking
<BR>never would have happened. Oh well, we learn hard lessons in life
<BR>sometimes; our heroes are tarnished, we are misled and we go on
<BR>searching. My nipples remain unsucked by the likes of Rhode Island
and
<BR>Rumson, and shall remain so&nbsp; - forever.

<P>OnON! to the 2nd Annual New England Red Dress Run,
<BR>Shine On "white as the driven snow" Harvard Moon&nbsp;&nbsp; ('!')
<BR>&nbsp;
