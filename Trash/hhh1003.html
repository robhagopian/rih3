<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>The Tour:</b></font></p>
<p>Pre-lube:  The Tour de Woonsocket has often been compared to the grueling 2,500 mile, one-month race Le Tour de France.  
The six-time Tour de France winner <font color="#FF0000">Lance Jovi Armstrong</font>, now retired from professional 
cycling, was selected as this year’s course setter.  Boldly, <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> warned that the 
Tour de Woonsocket will be even more difficult and treacherous than the Tour de France ever was, testing extreme limits 
of the body, mind, and soul.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1003/lance-bondo.jpg"><br><br>A victorious Jovi Armstrong in the Tour 
de France.<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>With such frightening rhetoric of such a grueling race, the big German <font color="#FF0000">Jan Boom Boom 
Ullrich</font>, the long-time rival of <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> both on and off the bicycle, promised 
a victorious performance.  And <font color="#FF0000">Marco Worm Infested Pantani</font>, who died a the age of 34 from 
mysterious causes, just as mysteriously came out of his grave to compete once again (too bad the team doctors couldn’t 
get all the worms out of his corpse).  But the young performers did not to give in too easily to the veterans, namely 
the up-cuming American star <font color="#FF0000">Tyler Boner Hamilton</font> and top Asian cyclist <font 
color="#FF0000">Kam-Po Fairy Wong</font>.  And in a bold and controversial move, race organizers allowed top female 
cyclist <font color="#FF0000">Dede Just Plain Stupid Berry</font> to compete with the men.  Being the daughter of the 
cycling legends <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Magen Big Shit Long</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry</font> certainly had the natural talent to compete with the boys.  And the 
women’s movement has apparently made historic strides over the years, as nobody could ever have guessed that the 
macho-man sport of cycling would ever let men and women compete together.</p>

<p>The cycling veteran <font color="#FF0000">Big Shit Long</font>, decided to sit this one out, suggesting she didn’t 
want to embarrass her husband <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font>, as she beats him quite often [Little does she 
know, he likes it!  But I digress.].  Another cycling legend <font color="#FF0000">Eddie Belle Merckx</font>, usually 
game for any challenge on two wheels with women involved, chose to stay in retirement.  But mysteriously absent were the 
Spaniard superstar (and often confused as being Pakistani) <font color="#FF0000">Miguel Syphilitic Dictaphone Indurain
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Greg The Nerd LeMond</font> (still in a tiff with <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong
</font> over the doping scandal), and the French female cyclist legend <font color="#FF0000">Jeannie Hoover Longo</font>.  
The absence of <font color="#FF0000">Hoover Longo</font> was a serious disappointment for the Tour, but the race must 
go on.  And after the scandalous 2003 Tour de France, where allegations and arrests over illegal doping dominated the 
headlines, the U.S. Postal team doctor <font color="#FF0000">Dr. Prentice Steffen (WHO?)</font>, remained in exile 
somewhere in the Carolinas.  Unfortunately, he failed to realize that the real dopes were those who decided to compete 
in the Tour de Woonsocket.</p>

<p>Before the race even started, confusion ensued:</p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><i>Another fine Bondoism – his posted directions, if anyone could find it in the RIH3 Message 
Board.</i><br><br>
<font face="courier">hey you fucken asso<br>

<i>And then he tried to improve upon it, by posting on the Guestbook.  But why try to improve upon perfection?</i><br><br>

in...... unless you are really stupid and wish for your dog to have a heart attack from running about 15 mi.....<br>
</font></blockquote>

<p>Yet the race, amazingly, if not unfortunately, got underway…<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Stage 1:  Bondo’s to St. Paul’s Cemetary</b></p>

<p>With the race scheduled to begin at 6:30, the organizers delayed the start to see if any late-cumers might arrive.  
Then the strong German <font color="#FF0000">Boom Boom Ullrich</font> pulled in, and the peleton (pack of cyclists) 
smartly took off.  Disappointingly, the race organizers failed to block off traffic, so the riders had to navigate the 
annoying and sometimes treacherous cars.  But the real tragedy at the start of the race was the lack of marks on the 
course.  The younger riders <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry
</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> managed to lead the peleton onto true trail, heading northeast.  A 
check at St. Paul’s Cemetary confused <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font>, who led <font color="#FF0000">Worm 
Infested Pantani</font> into the cemetery.  It was <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> who found true trail 
ending at a gravel lot, and won the first stage and took the overall race lead.  Like the coveted Yellow Jersey in the 
Tour de France, the overall leader in the Tour de Woonsocket wears the Bondo-beer soaked jersey.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry</font> provided a strong performance coming in second.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> was the sweeper cyclist, basking in the glow of setting a brilliant stage 
(obviously delusional over too much success).  The usually powerful German <font color="#FF0000">Boom Boom Ullrich</font> 
was nowhere to be seen and at risk of dropping out of the Tour on the very first stage.  It was rumored that his 
lavish off-season lifestyle, fervent with drugs, alcohol, and late-night parties, have deteriorated the German’s 
fitness.</p>

American super-star Boner Hamilton<br>dominated the early stages.<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p><b>Stage 2:  Undulating Railroad Grade Stage</b></p>

<p>The infamous Paris-Roubaix race was nicknamed “Northern Hell” by the riders who endured the 167-mile race through 
narrow cobble-stone streets of the Roman empire era, concluding with many cyclists visiting the emergency room.  However, 
the Undulating Railroad Grade Stage of this Tour made the cobble-stones of Paris-Roubaix seem like fresh, smooth 
pavement.  This stage tested the physical endurance and mental strain of every rider to their very limits.</p>

<p>Building on his early success, <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> quickly broke away from the peleton 
heading south on old railroad grade.  The chase lead by <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry</font> tried mightily to catch <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font>.  But 
the relentless undulations of the railroad grade, large stones, sporadic mud and puddles had impeded any chance of 
catching the speedy <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font>.  Even <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> helped 
break wind for the peleton.  Unfortunately, this appeared to hinder the riders’ efforts more than it helped them.  The 
once mighty <font color="#FF0000">Worm Infested Pantani</font> lagged at the back of the pack.  It seemed the years of 
decaying in his grave took a toll on his physical condition.  Exiting from the miles and miles of unrelenting railroad 
grade, <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> won the stage and retained the Bondo-beer soaked jersey.  But his 
victory was by only a small margin, as the talented <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> nearly caught him, yet the 
effort drained his energy.  An at this point, it appeared <font color="#FF0000">Boom Boom Ullrich</font> had abandoned 
the excruciating race.</p>

successful Worm Infested Pantani,<br>now struggles in the Tour (notice the nice earrings!).<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p><b>Stage 3:  The Suburban Mountain Stage</b></p>

<p>After the grueling and long undulating railroad stage, the riders could have used a break.  But course-setter <font 
color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> wanted to crush the spirits of his once-rivals.  It appeared his ruthlessness had 
no limits as the next stage was a horrific suburban mountain stage.  The vertical elevation gain must have been at least 
100 (one hundred) feet!  The French Alps were mere ant-hills in comparison to this behemoth in Woonsocket.  Heading north 
on a quiet suburban street, the peleton spread out, with <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> again in the lead.  
<font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> reached deep into his soul to find the strength to catch him.  Nearing the top 
of the mountain, his legs abandoned him, as the impressive <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry</font> caught 
and passed <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font>.  And riding her momentum up that mountain, she caught <font 
color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> who again led the entire stage.  But in a sprint finish, <font color="#FF0000">Boner 
Hamilton</font> again won the stage, and remained the overall leader.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1003/berry.jpg"><br><br>The beautiful yet Just Plain Stupid Berry 
is a rising star at the Tour,<br>and a surprising favorite for the win!<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p><b>Stage 4:  Hills by the Lakeside</b></p>

<p>The next stage started off with confusion as a check led <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> in the wrong directions.  Led by <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font>, it was 
<font color="#FF0000">Worm Infested Pantani</font> who took the stage lead, with <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid 
Berry</font> drafting closely behind.  <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> found himself in the unusual position 
of having to catch the leaders.  Working closely with <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font>, the two young riders made 
progress catching the others.  And then out of nowhere, the powerful and much-feared German super-star showed up out of 
nowhere!  Yes, <font color="#FF0000">Boom Boom Ullrich</font> decided to join the race.  Since he failed to complete 
the Undulating Railroad Grade and Suburban Mountain stages, he was already disqualified.  But <font color="#FF0000">Jovi 
Armstrong</font> allowed him to participate just in good sport.  The riders found themselves along the banks of 
Harris Pond, and the peleton, all together now, struggled mightily over the relentless hills, comparable to those found 
in the rugged Pyrenees Mountains in Europe.  All complained of sore arses, as the stage seemed to never end.</font>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1003/basket-jan3.jpg" width="439" height="657"><br><br>The bulging 
muscles of the Big German<br><i>Ich muß sie zerquetschen! (I must crush them!)<br>Jovi Armstrong ist mein Weibchen! 
(Jovi Armstrong is my bitch!)</i><br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>The pack found themselves heading northwest along Elm Street, where <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> managed 
to break away from the peleton to take the lead.  However, <font color="#FF0000">Boom Boom Ullrich</font> 
surreptitiously made <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> make a wrong turn and end up DFL.  Yet <font 
color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> found the strength and tenacity to pass everyone and catch <font color="#FF0000">Boom 
Boom Ullrich</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry</font> 
noticed the brewing rivalry and kept the two within reach.  <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Worm Infested Pantani</font> didn’t’ seem to care, as they casually rode in the peleton and reminisced 
about the old days of racing.  Finally, it was the big German who won the stage, ending at a “B” at a popular nature 
park.  Nevertheless, since <font color="#FF0000">Boom Boom Ullrich</font> was already disqualified, <font 
color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> retained the coveted Bondo-beer soaked jersey.</p>

<p>At the end of this stage, all were treated to Bondo-brew and many blood-thirsty mosquitoes.  Replenishing themselves 
with fluids, alcohol, and calories, the riders were eager to resume the Tour as they were quickly losing precious blood.  
<font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> decided at this point to drive the race support vehicle the last stage.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Stage 5:  Farm Street, Farm Street, Farm Street</b></p>

<p>Being second to <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry</font> saw 
this last stage as her final opportunity to win the race.  She quickly broke away from the peleton and took a lengthy 
lead.  This forced <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> to launch a chase group, with <font color="#FF0000">Fairy 
Wong</font> closely following.  The stage was relatively straight forward – Blackstone St. to Farm St. to <font 
color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong’s</font> house.  The previous stage win by the big German took its toll on him, as he 
and <font color="#FF0000">Worm Infested Pantani</font> not only lagged behind, but managed to get lost on this very 
straight and simple stage.  Along Farm Road, <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font> once again tested his 
“relationship” with the authorities as he laid on his horn passing each one of the riders (obvious jealousy that he is 
no longer in their league of supreme physical condition).  A police cruiser slowed down and contemplated apprehending 
the menacing <font color="#FF0000">Jovi Armstrong</font>, but against better judgment the cruiser continued on.</p>

<center><p class="blue">&nbsp;<br><img src="Images/1003/fairy-wong.jpg"><br><br>Fairy Wong's love for young nubile 
elephants<br>distracted his otherwise brilliant efforts in the Tour.<br>&nbsp;</p></center>

<p>Nearing the end of the stage, by St. Charles Cemetary, <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> caught the leader 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry</font>, and he took the lead.  <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> also 
caught <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid</font> but they decided to work together to reign in <font 
color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font>.  Within sight of the finish on Winter St., the race leader <font 
color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font>, made a bone-head move (why do you think they call him <font color="#FF0000">Boner 
Hamilton</font>?) and turned south on Prospect St., just a block away from the finish.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain 
Stupid Berry</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font> watched <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font> head 
in the wrong direction, as they took the race lead.  It was a sprint finish onto Woodland Rd. and turning onto Meadow Rd 
to the finish.  And to everyone’s surprise, <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid Berry</font> won by the slimmest of 
margins over <font color="#FF0000">Fairy Wong</font>!  And for the first time in history, a woman earned the Bondo-brew 
soaked jersey as the winner of the Tour de Woonsocket.  Fortunately for <font color="#FF0000">Boner Hamilton</font>, the 
loss of <font color="#FF0000">Boom Boom Ullrich</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Worm Infested Pantani</font> had 
lifted his spirits.  The beer helped as well.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p>On-on-on was at <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> abode, where circle was held as <font color="#FF0000">Boom Boom 
Ullrich</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Worm Infested Pantani</font> unfortunately found their way and finished.  
Comments on the Tour were the usual, but added points were given for a rare bike hash and the back-sliding bimbo 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Kristen</font>.  Total:  <b>+6.9!</b>  No doubt supported by <font color="#FF0000">Tinker’s
</font> +104.2 (who didn’t even participate in the Tour).  Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, for 
no worthy reason at all.  Hashers were joined by <font color="#FF0000">Just Kristen’s</font> three young children who 
seemed to be fascinated with the hashers as they sang incomprehensible, yet amusing songs.  Then all enjoyed <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> dynamites with <font color="#FF0000">Just Big Shit</font> assisting with the food and 
covering the innocents’ little ears.  There was also an impromptu naming, as <font color="#FF0000">Just Kristen</font> 
became <font color="#FF0000">Just Plain Stupid (JPS)</font>, as she didn’t have the wherewithal to deny her genetic 
links to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>.</p>

<p>All in all, the Tour de Woonsocket was deemed a great success, but in reality it was just another pathetic waste 
of a Monday evening.</p>
