<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run: </font></p>

<p>Only the few and foolish braved their way to the RT and CT border west of Coventry. Was the hare paying homage to our 
dear and departed Ct hasher now transplanted to the bowels of the Bahstan hash i.e..<font color="#FF0000"> Raging</font>? 
Or was he enticing the hash with the promise of young scouts from the nearby camp? Was this where <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> was lost? Nevertheless, the hash barely waited for the hare to return before setting off westwards into the 
constitution state. The first half mile was dirt road before encountering the first check. The pack was sent northwards 
into the woods to a crossing over the stream. The trail then skirted the same stream thru more checks crossing the stream 
again over the rocky banks to the massive dam. The run took the pack over the stream to the other side of the dam and back 
over it again and around Yawgoog pond to another check that took the pack southwards first on a rocky trail then thru woods 
back over another stream and bushwhacking and back into the state of RI. The pack was lured to the beer check by sounds of 
exotic birds, wolves and cows i.e.. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and SESYB on top of a hill. Beer and singing ensued. 
The trail led back out to the cars. Down down to the hares, the visitor, and the hashit <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. 
OnIn at Marks Grille where we enjoyed the Red Sox beat Oakland in the playoffs. All agreed this not only was the run of the 
millennium sofar but the blueprint of what a great RI Hash run should be like.</p>
