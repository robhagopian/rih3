<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, Dryfoot Fairy, Amish Ithead,

<p>What a letdown.  There was all this talk about it being the “end of the world hash” and no one died.  No lightning 
bolts flashed from the sky to strike down us sinners.  No flames lapped at our feet from weird looking holes in the 
ground.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> didn’t even trip over a wire fence and slice his nose open.  Pathetic!  I 
must take partial blame though; as I pulled onto Arcadia Rd I saw <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> heading the wrong way 
and inexcusably turned him around.  One less hasher on trail is at least two more beers available for us.  Or six, 
something like that.</p>

<p>A small crowd including <font color="#FF0000">Mr. Rogers</font>, a visitor from Boston, and a matching shirted <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (how cute, did they call each other before leaving?) 
gathered prior to 6:30 in the parking lot outside of Browning Mill Pond.  Starting off, the group headed east to Arcadia 
Rd and encountered the first of a few checks.  It looked like a boob.  Unfortunately, it was not a boob.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, not caring about the boob-like check, darted across the road and into the woods continuing 
east along true-trail.  A slight left was taken as we approached a bridge stretching over a small pond, much to the 
unknown happiness of a woman fishing.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could imagine the ruckus that might ensue if we 
interrupted her after-work peace?  Somehow <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was able to maintain his position as FRB 
and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> followed.
  <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> and the visitor were nowhere to be found.  Coincidence?  I think not!</p>

<p>Trail continued in a clock-wise motion around the pond, which at this point had become more of a marsh, and the first 
water crossing was encountered.  Luckily enough for the hash, the hare had been out slaving all day to place rocks in 
juuuust the right position to allow passage without getting wet.  Brilliant!  The second water crossing was a little 
trickier, not due to the hare, but due to mother nature and two of her loveliest creatures of all, the beaver!  The dam 
trail had been covered with dam water as the beavers created their dam home.  This caused all hashers to get their dam 
feet wet because there was no way to find a dam shortcut.  This reminds me of one of those chain-letter like emails I 
received last year, which I will subject all of you to.  Read it through you wankers – no short cutting to the end of this 
writeup!</p>

<p><i>SUBJECT: DEQ File No.97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec. 20; Montcalm County<br><br>

Dear Mr. DeVries:<br><br>

It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity 
on the above referenced parcel of property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the 
following unauthorized activity:<br><br>

Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond.<br><br>

A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A review of the department's files shows that no 
permits have been issued.  Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301, Inland 
Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being 
sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, annotated.<br><br>

The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially failed during a recent rain event, causing debris 
and flooding at downstream locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted.  
The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a 
free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the stream channel.  All restoration work shall 
be completed no later than January 31, 2005.<br><br>

Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by 
our staff.  Failure to comply with this request or any further unauthorized activity on the site may result in this case 
being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.
<br><br>

Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
David L. Price, District Representative<br>
Land and Water Management Division<br><br>

Re: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec. 20; Montcalm County.<br><br>

Dear Mr. Price,<br><br>

Your certified letter dated 12/17/02 has been handed to me to respond to.  I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor 
at 2088 Dagget, Pierson, Michigan.  A couple of beavers are in the process of constructing and maintaining two wood 
"debris" dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond.<br><br>

While I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call 
their skillful use of natures building materials "debris."  I would like to challenge your department to attempt to 
emulate their dam project any time and/or any place you choose.<br><br>

I believe I can safely state there is no way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam 
ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.<br><br>

As to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first fill out a dam permit prior to the start of 
this type of dam activity.<br><br>

My first dam question to you is: (1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers, or (2) do you require 
all beavers throughout this state to conform to said dam request?  If you are not discriminating against these particular 
beavers, through the Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam 
permits that have been issued.  Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and 
Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 
324.30101to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, annotated.<br><br>

I have several concerns.  My first concern is; aren't the beavers entitled to legal representation?  The Spring Pond 
Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said representation -- so the State will have to provide them 
with a dam lawyer.  The Department's dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event, 
causing flooding, is proof that this is a natural occurrence, which the Department is required to protect.  In other 
words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling their dam names.<br><br>

If you want the stream "restored" to a dam free-flow condition please contact the beavers -- but if you are going to 
arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter, they being unable to read English.<br><br>

In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, 
the grass is green and water flows downstream.  They have more dam rights than I do to live and enjoy Spring Pond. If the 
Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection lives up to its name, it should protect the natural 
resources (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers' Dams).<br><br>

So, as far as the beavers and I are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more elevated enforcement action right 
now.  Why wait until 1/31/2005?  The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then and there will be no way for you or 
your dam staff to contact/harass them then.<br><br>

In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention to a real environmental quality (health) problem in the area.  It 
is the bears!  Bears are actually defecating in our woods.  I definitely believe you should be persecuting the defecating 
bears and leave the beavers alone.  If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step! (The bears are not 
careful where they dump!)<br><br>

Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending 
this response to your dam office.<br><br>

THANK YOU.<br>
RYAN DEVRIES & THE DAM BEAVERS</i></p>

<p>Haha – get it?  That was a good story.  Anyway, back to the trail.  After hopping back on dry land the group (minus 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> – where did <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> go?) continued in a southward direction.
  Another boob check was encountered, with Basket making a right and shortly after tooting his horn to let others know he 
was on trail.  But <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> listens to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>?  Actually, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> does not – so he and Amish continued straight for a bit until hitting a false trail mark.  A 
quick u-turn had them going back in the right direction where they met up with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and 
followed the sounds of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  Once again, <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> and the 
visitor were nowhere to be found.  Coincidence?  I think not!</p>

<p>Trail weaved to and fro as it made a slightly uphill turn to a third, and most important boob check.  The pack chose to 
go right.  Not too much farther and a BN was spotted (but not by FRB <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, who must have 
thought this hash was a race and continued to run in the #1 position for a long time*, as he managed to overlook this 
important mark) and everyone spread out looking for our reward for running this crappy trail.  Viola, a cooler.  Songs 
were once again scarce, but conversation on the Interhash was not.  We were exposed to <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder
</font> stating she wants to see Bangkok for the shopping.  And <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> mentioning he wants to 
see Bangkok for the “entertainment.”  And <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> reminiscing about a “slippery slidy.”  For the 
love of Lucifer may the Interhash be over with so we can go back to a normal beer check.  As the first beers were opened a 
grey flash came out of the woods – <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, who’d run the trail backwards and who was almost 
unrecognizable without his yellow coat.  And then we turned to witness a mad race to the beer between <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, who even on a bike was not able beat the over-dressed 
one.  Pathetic! Apparently being the only one to find the hare’s long falsie (hmm, that almost has a double meaning) wore 
the old man out.</p>

<p>Once everyone had been bored crazy with Interhash talk and a handful of song versus were sung, the hare admitted that 
the remainder of the trail was a straight gravel road back to the parking lot.  Booo!  In what felt like 30sec the pack 
was back at the cars and getting ready to circle up.  Except that <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> and the visitor 
were nowhere to be found.  Coincidence?  I think not!  The circle started as we hung out near the water drinking beers and 
having a good ‘ol time only to be interrupted by an “on-on” from the far side of the muddy, stinky, dirty inlet we were 
standing by.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> else, but <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font>.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> attempted to get her to swim across 
but a momentary flash of intelligence swept upon her (after going hip deep in water, though) and she decided to run around 
instead and stay dry.</p>

<p>The circle included various bits of nonsense.  Two toilet-seat hashits.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> yapping 
his mouth that England was going to win the World Cup.  <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> ogling the bare-chested 
hare.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> showing up just minutes before the circle. When the comments finally came out 
they included “good use of shiggy” to “no <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font>,” to “<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
running the long falsie” to “why can’t we just get out of here.”  Total score: <b>+7.0</b>.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> knows how we ended up with a rating not made up of “6s” and “9s,” it must be a first.  Just as with the dual 
hashits that went to <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for looking alternative by 
wearing the same shirt.  Aren’t we all queers together though?</p>

<p>A spin up Rt 3 brought us to the Big River Inn, which was surprisingly packed.  Once again the waitress was easy on the 
eyes, although not “biceps” from an earlier visit.  That’s good though, the chances of any of us being able to stand up to 
her would be slim-to-none.  After much confusion on <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> ordered what (how dare the waitress 
say that we must remember what we ordered ourselves!) everyone had their food and things quieted down.  Will tomorrow be 
the end of the world?  That’s for the devil to know and the us to find out….</p>

<p>*we really consider you “number two” material, Basket</p>
