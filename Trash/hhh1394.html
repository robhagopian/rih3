This was to be the event of the year. Christ, it had homeybrew, two beer stops, Xmass lights, virgin trail, with promises of sugarplums dancing in our heads.<br><br>

The start was from, the now famous Fuwangii start, Bliss Brothers. It generously skipped the now infamous OOzing lap behind the Old Folks home and stayed straight on the pavement to the LaSalette Shrine. There was little of the complaining you might normally find with having to trod on hard pavement for so long, but the thought of thrashing through the briers and marsh of the swamp was nothing any of us was interested in.<br><br>

The pack followed the Hare as he ran in front of us tossing flour, since he had laid trail in the swamp and tried to make sure nobody got lost, not even Basket. We arrived at theLaSalette parking lot and each went in their own direction, trying to find what flour was left on the rain soaked ground. Dog Meat thought she'd find some in the restroom at the gift-shop  but Flow and WHO picked up trail around the pond and into the woods<br><br>

The trail went just a short while, over a small bridge, until it came to rest at an old well. Home brew was sampled, and a cautionary note was offered by Donkey. His brew got hit with some bad yeast, don't you hate that, but despite his warning, most of us sampled the beer. Shemale offered his brew and a number of micros for sampling with the bottles passing around like a hot potato.<br><br>

With the beer gone, we made our way along the winding trails behind the shrine, with at least one good check sending the pack in many directions. Flo and Weebals found flour going out to the field and crossing the brook, to the second beer stop.<br><br>

IPA was enjoyed along with some orange food, and there was much singing and gratefulness of having real beers. When the beer was gone, we found ourselves back on the trail behind the Old Folks home and back in, on the street, to the start.<br><br>

A circle was formed on the hill overlooking the dairy. Donkey brought out his St Nick outfit and offered us his anal Xmas shot of Baileys. DD's were administered and more singing and drinking was enjoyed by all, before making our way to Wetherlaines for food and drink.<br><br>
Stories on Wednesday of exploding shite and painful stomach distress for two days after was blamed on Donkey's bad beer by most WHO partook, but they can't say they weren't warned.
