style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Another holiday, 
another school parking lot, another powerline, another hash. Ho Hum. But it was 
sunny, it was early and there were bimbos, visitors and virgins. The hash 
started from Cranston West High School near the tennis courts on Phenix Ave. The 
hare directed the pack to cross west to the powerlines, and they were off.

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Following the 
basic <FONT color=#ff0000>Dry Foot</FONT> trail (Run #1058), the falsies were 
easily mastered, although <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Fuwangi </FONT>tried the path closest to 295 where <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Dry Foot</FONT> had set his first beer check. This allowed <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> to lead the visitor and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT> on true trail up the powerlines and over to 295 beyond the hill. 
Trail went close to the road, emerging out on the shoulder at one point. A check 
on the dirt road under 295 caused some confusion. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
guessed correctly and crossed to the west side of the 
road.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail now looped 
south on some dirt paths. A nearly dry stream was crossed. No shiggy whatsoever. 
It looked as though the hare was headed for the quarries; a lovely spot for a 
Beer Check. But <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO </FONT>defied all the laws of 
probability and again guessed correctly, curving back northeast. He and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>2 Fuck Canuck</FONT> arrived back at the underpass. It now 
displayed a large “B”. And a large bag o’ B was found. Naturally, the two 
carried it a short distance away into the woods.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The rest of the 
pack straggled in with the hare. The hare was most vocal about the loss of his 
beer, having been through this more than once. Only <FONT color=#ff0000>Shine 
On</FONT> was enterprising enough to find <FONT color=#ff0000>Dr WHO</FONT> and 
the visitor, giggling like schoolgirls 20 yards into the woods. She became a 
willing co-conspirator. Waiting can be hard, though. Once <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>headed off on the trail in, they came out and shared 
the beer. Oh boy, was it funny, though!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">After the 
rhubarb rose, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Friar </FONT>returned, the group made short work of the remaining 
beer. Trail back was trail in, reversed. How imaginative. The group decided to 
circle back at the hare’s house, where a BBQ was planned. The run was rated. No 
virgin territory, no one lost, no shiggy, and missing beer were balanced against 
bimbos, minimal pavement, and missing beer tricks. Total: +0.69. The virgin was 
queried, the visitors lambasted, and the backsliders punished. Hashit went to 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Eenie Weenie Dick</FONT>, for reasons lost in the mists of 
time. Way too much food was served, and the afternoon ended when <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Dr WHO</FONT> had sold his last commemorative crap 
T-shirt.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
