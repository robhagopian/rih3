<p><font color="#008000">Run #1047</font>, April 24, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Scituate</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 50’s, Cloudy with sprinkles of rain</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Tinker, Async, Cum Under, Seamus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hare set a trail at “No Doctors Lane” in Scituate. Wishful thinking! Hash attendance may be at an all-time low. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> do you not want to come? And, hare creativity seems to be approaching an all-time high. 
This is not a good thing. [Hare creativity = a trail that is exceptional in qualities that annoy and irritate everyone in 
the pack. This hash was a prime example of this.] The hare conceived a trail that could be described as redundant, 
repetitive, ridiculous, or repugnant. (And several other words beginning with the letter “R”, as well! Like rat-vomit!) 
There was no bushwhacking. There was no shiggy. There was trespassing on reservoir property. And the trail could best be 
described as an A to A to B to A to A to B to C. If you get my drift. But let the following narrative speak for itself!</p>

<p>Trail began from No(rth) Doctor’s Lane in Scituate. The “No Doctors” demand by the hare worked only partially. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> didn’t show up. And <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> was late. <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> went first to So(uth) Doctor’s Lane, just to show the hare. It was a small group then, that set out on trail 
west from the parking area. It was a nice path. Smooth, and well-used. The kind of path you’d like to spend some time on. 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> led and at the first check, turned north on a powerline. <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> continued straight followed by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> called on, 
and they turned back joining <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> turning uphill on the powerlines. The hare lagged behind, 
and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> briefly considered turning back to shadow 
him. Stupidly they continued north.</p>

<p>A second check was missed by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> who continued straight to some holding ponds for the 
water purification plant. A good place to get arrested, by the way. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turned right again, 
east on true trail. He came out on North Road (116) and guessed right, right again. But another check sent him east into a 
small neighborhood, while <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> turned right, right 
again on to a second powerline heading southwest. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
followed. Trail led to a path. It was a nice path. Smooth and well-used. The kind of path you’d like to spend some time 
on.</p>

<p>Following this strangely familiar path, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> came to a strangely familiar check. This 
time he went straight and came up through the woods to find the hare. And some beer. Not too shabby. Eight tenths of a 
mile, and a Beer Check! The rest straggled in, and they quickly hid the Guinness from the DFL, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>. Ah, the simple pleasures of life! The hare mentioned that there would be a second beer check, so they 
almost forgave him the reuse of trail (not to mention the totally contrived and unnecessary clockwise loop). Finishing up, 
they continued just north of west.</p>

<p>They came to a check on the banks of the Pawtuxet River, and immediately found true trail southeast along the river. 
Trail led back to No Doctor’s Lane, then followed the west side of some playing fields. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
led and followed true trail south. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> saw a furtive figure ahead, so he bushwhacked towards 
an overgrown dirt mound, and turned east to come upon true trail. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> saw <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, and saved himself quite a bit of running by diagonally turning to cut off <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> ran around in circles. Trail turned back north. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> caught up with the furtive figure. He had assumed it was the hare. But no! It was <font 
color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>. They came out of the woods together, at the east side of the playing fields. Another 
contrived and unnecessary loop, but this time it was counter-clockwise.</p>

<p>Trail led back to the cars. A new arrow had appeared. Pointing to a path. It was a nice path. Smooth and well-used. The 
kind of path you’d like to spend some time on. And the path led to a check. A strangely familiar check. This had been 
changed though. The hare had made it into a smiley face. Cute. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, well ahead of the 
others by now, continued straight. The rest, unable to believe this repetition, turned left, and found the only shiggy of 
the evening. But it was not part of the trail. Eventually, they turned back, continued in <font color="#FF0000">Async’s
</font> path, and came upon <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and the hare at a strangely familiar Beer Check. But at 
least there was beer.</p>

<p>It was with considerable misgivings that the group set off for the third time. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> 
wisely decided to return to his car. He was getting pretty damned tired of this path. Even if it WAS a nice path! But the 
hare shooed the rest along. They returned to the banks of the Pawtuxet. This time they turned north, on a bushwhack. But 
there was no shiggy to speak of. Keeping together, they came out to a dirt path that led to a road circling the holding 
ponds. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> turned left (right). <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> turned left (wrong, but 
he would have been right if he had just continued another 50 yards). (The wank!) They came to the sluice-way feeding the 
pond, and crossed. Their feet got slightly moistened. But this was obviously a blatant attempt by the hare to distract the 
hashers and make them forget what a pathetic trail this had been. Either that or a misguided attempt to poison 
Providence’s water supply with mud from the previous weeks.</p>

<p>At any rate, they circle back, now on the east side of the holding pond. They passed the road that <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> WOULD HAVE COME OUT ON, SAVING AT LEAST ¼ MILE OF WORTHLESS RUNNING AND A PATHETIC STREAM 
CROSSING, IF HE HAD JUST PERSEVERED AND CALLED THE REST ON WHEN HE HAD SEEN THE OBVIOUS MARK NEAR THE ROAD! Or whatever! A 
check was ignored, and they climbed up onto the powerlines heading south. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> led. [It 
seemed like he had to be somewhere, or was training for a r*ce, or something. He sure was in a hurry. What an athlete! But 
I digress.]  He encountered the hare at the peak of the ridge. The hare had beer. They decided to stop and have the 
circle. The group gathered and: surprise! Another furtive figure was sighted coming north up the hill. It was <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>. Intuition? Trailcraft? Brilliant reasoning? Or inside info from the hare! You be the 
judge.</p>

<p>They circled. The run was rated high for creativity (a bad thing!) low for shiggy-content (another bad thing!) and low 
for lack of lost hashers. And two doctors were present! But, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, no <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> has to count 
for something. Total: <b>-0.69</b>. Hashit: somehow, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> avoided the award, and it was 
given to <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, for accepting bribes, inside information, and missing out on the third 
contrived and unnecessary loop. Finishing up, they turned south down the powerlines. They came to a strangely familiar 
check. They turned left on a path. It was a nice path. Smooth and well-used. The kind of path you’d like to spend some 
time on. Back at the cars, the hare directed them to Bill’s in Phenix, where they had a subdued and quiet finish to the 
evening, each of them going over the run in their minds, trying to figure out why they had come, and what had gone so 
terribly, terribly wrong! This figure may provide some insight for those who did not attend:
