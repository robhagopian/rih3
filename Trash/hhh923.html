<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>‘Twas the hash before Christmas<br>
And up in Glendale<br>
Hare Basket and Santa Jovi were<br>
Sucking down Ale.</p>

<p>Basket in his lab coat,<br>
And Bondo in his cap<br>
Had just settled down to<br>
A boozy pre-hash nap.</p>

<p>The hash was to start<br>
In North Smithfield at four.<br>
But the hare broke the clock;<br>
Santa started to snore.</p>

<p>When out of the phone<br>
There arose such a clatter:<br>
At the start Async and WHO<br>
Were crying: &quot;What is the Matter?&quot;</p>

<p>The hare made excuses <br>
And ran for his truck.<br>
SESYB and Oozing arrived<br>
and said: &quot;What the f*ck!&quot;</p>

<p>The B*tch dressed for the holiday,<br>
And twinkled like a prism.<br>
Oozing put stuff in his beard<br>
(it looked strangely like jism!)</p>

<p>Oozing and SESYB said:<br>
&quot;Such is our luck.<br>
We've got to wait for<br>
Muffalotta and Friar F*ck&quot;.</p>

<p>So when the hare finally came<br>
with Ben and Seamus in tow,<br>
Only WHO and Async<br>
A-hashing did go.</p>

<p>With the hare right behind them<br>
Southwest they all sped,<br>
While visions of shigginess<br>
Danced in their heads.</p>

<p>Crossing through Pacheco Park<br>
At Route 5, a check<br>
Led across the Branch River.<br>
But, shiggy? Not a speck!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back up in Slatersville<br>
Drawn by the noise<br>
Came ‘Lotta and B*tch<br>
With the rest of the boys.</p>

<p>From warehouse to warehouse<br>
Through chemical waste<br>
The FRB’s hope for<br>
Virgin trail was misplaced.</p>

<p>Back on Route 5<br>
Trail led up a slope<br>
Async found&nbsp; a “B”<br>
But was there beer? Nope!</p>

<p>The hare had hung back<br>
To help the rest find the way<br>
(Was it just being helpful,<br>
Or just ‘cause he’s GAY?!)</p>

<p>He made for the BC,<br>
B*tch and Oozing in tow.<br>
But Friar and Muffalotta<br>
Had no clue where to go.</p>

<p>But finally at the Beer Check<br>
They gathered, seven strong,<br>
And drank from the jugs that<br>
The hare brought along.</p>

<p>The hare next directed them <br>
On with a whistle<br>
And to the Homestead they flew <br>
Like the down of a thistle.</p>

<p>The Homestead was crowded<br>
With folks of good cheer,<br>
Midst the lights and the carols,<br>
Things were about to turn queer.</p>

<p>On Async, On Friar<br>
On Oozing, On WHO, <br>
On SESYB, On Muffalotta,<br>
And the hare and hounds too!</p>

<p>They burst through the children<br>
With confusion and clamor<br>
With horn, shouts and whistles<br>
And Ho-Ho-Ho’s with a stammer.</p>

<p>Trail soon led them east<br>
To the back of the park.<br>
Async and Friar left trail<br>
Towards CVS in the dark.</p>

<p>The rest crossed some swamp land<br>
With ice and a stream.<br>
Some shiggy at last?<br>
Not a chance, just a dream!</p>

<p>WHO led up to a highway<br>
North on Route 146!<br>
Against traffic they ran:<br>
More Stupid Hare Tricks!</p>

<p>After crossing the river<br>
They were in Forestdale.<br>
A mark on the riverbank<br>
Led west on true trail.</p>

<p>A brief run through the woods<br>
And then back on the street<br>
To the cars they went quickly<br>
With asphalt-bruised feet.</p>

<p>Muff and Friar were missing<br>
“They can’t be too far!”<br>
said WHO, (as he drove off<br>
To get some Muff in his car!)</p>

<p>At last all were assembled<br>
At the Snake Hill Road house<br>
With EverReady, KNO, Jody<br>
And the hare’s long-suffering spouse.</p>

<p>And Santa Jovi snored on<br>
Too full of good cheer.<br>
A cattle-prod woke him,<br>
He called for more beer!</p>

<p>The circle was joined<br>
The run was assessed<br>
6.9 was the total,<br>
the poor sod did his best!</p>

<p>Hashit was WHO’s<br>
Yet again, one more time.<br>
For rescuing hashers<br>
A definite crime.</p>

<p>A fine meal was had<br>
And the beer kept on pouring<br>
And Santa had to be nudged<br>
Just to keep him from snoring.</p>

<p>The presents were brought out:<br>
Each hasher would come<br>
And sit upon Santa<br>
(Who tried to fondle their bum!</p>

<p>Cookies, books, dildos,<br>
“Adult” connect-the-dots<br>
(Where connecting 68 to 69<br>
always seemed to show tw*ts!)</p>

<p>The fine night was over<br>
We left $5 in cash<br>
A merry Xmas for all,<br>
And for all, a good hash!</p>
