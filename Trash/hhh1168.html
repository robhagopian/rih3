<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Starting from 
the first parking lot as you enter Beavertail State Park on Jamestown, the group 
arrived with low expectations. There is only so much that can be done on a 
relatively narrow peninsula with four or five north-south paths, two roads and a 
lot of impenetrable underbrush between. But it was lovely weather. A cooling 
salt-breeze spiced the air. And a lovely bimbo was present, induced to give 
hashing a try by <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Colin</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Spencer.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = 
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail started at 
6:30 promptly. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> was not there, so they were in 
more of a hurry than usual. Marks led east across the fields, and took a path 
that led to the exit road. A check led the pack south to the point. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> led the 
other <FONT color=#ff0000>Just boys</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Sam</FONT>(antha) on true trail. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> were suspicious and tried the paths that led into 
shiggy (soon proven to be, in fact, impenetrable underbrush) heading back west. 
Right idea, wrong timing.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Just before 
reaching the lighthouse, trail turned west and entered the shoreline path on the 
west side of the park. A few checks were present, but no one was fooled for 
long. The leaders continued north with occasional trips down to the rocks of the 
shore. This slowed them enough that <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was able to 
sneak past with the hare to the final destination and the Beer 
check.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Meanwhile, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> had arrived, and was busy searching the eastern 
shore for any marks. It’s too bad you can’t really get lost on a relatively 
narrow peninsula with four or five north-south paths, two roads and a lot of 
impenetrable underbrush between. The beer was found, and brought down to the 
water. A lovely sunset was beginning. A long medley of songs was begun, to try 
and ensure that the visiting young lady would never return. It’s worked, so 
far.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Returning from 
the Beer check, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> set out first, ignoring the 
hare’s instructions to look for a mark on the left. He followed the shore until 
he came to the path that led straight to the cars. Unfortunately, it also led 
straight to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket.</FONT> <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Just Matt</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> 
had the same idea. But <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> led the rest on true 
trail. He lost the trail. Too bad you can’t really get too lost on a relatively 
narrow peninsula with four or five north-south paths, two roads and a lot of 
impenetrable underbrush between.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The missing 
group finally decided to ignore <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, and found 
their way back to the cars. The circle was held down the path a bit, just out of 
sight of the parking lot. Ratings for the run mentioned lack of shiggy, too much 
pavement, and no virgin territory. But the bimbo, the beer check, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT> befuddlement clinched the deal. Total: +6.9! The 
virgin was interrogated and despite considerable (and perhaps unseemly) urging, 
told a joke rather than showing a body part. Hashit went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Dr WHO</FONT>, for being the one to first run into <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Finishing up, they moved on to the Narragansett 
Tavern, minus <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> (no loss) and the virgin and her 
escorts (at least one loss.)<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
