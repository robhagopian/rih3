<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The fabled Hanton City, the “Lost City” of Smithfield, RI was the site for the first daylight hash of 2004. The ruins 
of this difficult-to-find town are reputedly haunted. It was transiently populated by runaway slaves in the early 1800’s, 
and few now know of its existence. But the uneasy spirits of these vengeful slaves still walk the lands. Their favorite 
activity is apparently to misdirect the unwary. It is said that some who find the Lost City are never seen again. A 
perfect spot for a hash, and a perfect hare for the job. No one could doubt that this would be a memorable screw-up.</p>

<p>The hash started from a leveled lot (the former Tina’s?) opposite the Comfort Inn on Rt 7 in Smithfield. The small 
group initially consisted of the hare, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, WHO, Fuwangi, and SESYB.</font> They were soon 
cheered by the return of <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, coinciding no doubt with the first hash not requiring 
flashlights. After some <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew or a sip of Trinity Stout from the hare, they turned into 
the woods.</p>

<p>Directed by the hare, no marks were seen for some time as they bushwhacked northeast past a collapsed shack to a dark 
and swampy area where trail was finally picked up. But the hare soon managed to lose it again along with the rest. There 
were deer tracks and a few poor paths though, and they made their way finally out to a gas pipeline. The hare directed the 
group west and sent <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>east. No marks were seen yet.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led to a five-way intersection with the pipeline, the Hanton City Trail, and another 
path. He continued straight towards the powerlines. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>turned northwest. <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> tried south. But <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> discovered a few marks which actually led 
west through a fence. The group came back together on a dirt road with another check. Little did they know, they were in 
the middle of the Lost City!</p>

<p>To the south, a water tower could be seen, raising hopes for a beer check. But the true trail was northwest on the Rand 
Aldrich Trail. Marks soon turned north, and they found themselves bushwhacking again. And the marks were lost again. But 
as trail curved around to the east, they were all together apart from <font color="#FF0000">Tinker.</font> Mysteriously, 
someone was behind them signaling with shouts and whistles.</p>

<p>Continuing the curve, they turned south and hit the gas pipeline, where at the top of a hill, they found the “B”. But 
no<font color="#FF0000"> Tinker</font>. The hare was perplexed as he admitted to giving the semi-prosthetic hasher inside 
information regarding the BC. But after a few minutes, a bedraggled Tinker emerged from the trail behind them. Apparently, 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>had halted his search of the pipelines a few yards shy of the “B”, and had become lost 
trying to follow some distant and haunting sounds of Negro spiritual songs through the woods. Luckily, before he was too 
far lost, he picked up the scent of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo.</font> He turned onto the trail, made easy to follow now 
with the damaged underbrush caused by the passage of <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>.</p>

<p>On in trail returned west on the pipeline.  <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
lead, trying with little success to avoid the large pools of mud and water in the dips along the trail. It was getting 
dark but there was still really no need for flashlights. There were no marks to be seen, anyways. They returned to the 
five-way intersection, where the hare had instructed them to turn left. They were back on the Hanton City trail, and 
clearly headed south to Rt 7.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> were fortunate 
to be leading, because they turned towards the sounds of cars and came out to Rt 7 on Lydia Ann Rd. The hare led the rest 
off into some woods by Rt 116, lost again.</p>

<p>When they all gathered again at the cars, it was noticed that a new car was present: the <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font>-mobile. A prolonged discussion about responsibilities, dangers, opportunities and cab-fare ensued. But just 
as the hare was preparing to make his way back to the Lost City, a sheepish <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> emerged 
from the ruins of the shack, claiming to have tried valiantly to find the trail. It seemed more likely that he had just 
stepped into the shack for a little nap.</p>

<p>They circled and rated the run. No <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, lost 
trail, shiggy, it looked good for the hare at first. But the return of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> resulted in 
substantial downgrading, and he received a 0.69. Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, because she had it 
already. The circle ended with Swing Low, just as the Smithfield Police swung into the parking area to investigate the 
gathering. They had received several calls about paranormal activity in the area. They were quickly reassured and 
convinced when <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>explained that they were 
athletes in a running club. The on on on was of course at Parente’s. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> got lost driving 
there.</p>
