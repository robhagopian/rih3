<font face="Arial" size="2">Hashers began to gather early at the parking lot at
the trail head southeast of Joe's Rock [a famous local outcropping of note Joe's
Rock was the first 'Pet' rock domesticated and trained in the late 1950's, since
tragically abandoned by Joe when Marilyn left him for John]. <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> arrived early, in a haze of steroid psychosis caused by her attempt to
cure herself of poison ivy which she encountered while recruiting for the RIH3
in Boston. She soon began to recruit at this hash also. <font color="#FF0000">Just
Rob</font>, out to test his 100%-guaranteed-mosquito-proof tattoos, was
strangely interested, and left briefly to get his bicycle. <font color="#FF0000">Sync</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font>, both with professional gear, began
speaking alternately in Italian and French, telling tales of their last 'Tour de
Woonsocket'. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> demonstrated his masculine
self-assurance by riding his wife's 'girlie' bike in circles in the parking lot,
crashing into cars. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was practically naked, in
shorts and a kevlar T-shirt. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Trail
Hoover</font> arrived surreptitiously, with the echoes of Pakistani curses in
their ears. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> surveyed the crowd, and muttered
something about beer-stops, but provided those interested with some Canadian Ale
in paper medicine cups usually reserved for antacids or laxatives. All awaited <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Baxter,</font> whose imminent arrival was
guaranteed by <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font>. He finally arrived,
suffering from a fulminant toxemia caused by the blood poisoning in his system
from the previous week's hash. No one could tell the difference.<br>
<br>
<br>
The trail began heading across West road, south on dirt paths. A field filled
with opium poppies was entered, marked by a large flour-covered turd specially
provided by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> during the setting of the hash.
The narcosis induced by the field would come in handy later on. Continuing
south, avoiding the Emerald City, the woods were entered and some mild mud was
encountered as the crew worked their way south and East. Async, after a head
start, maintained the lead until he became fatigued. Strategically, he began to
draft on the Clydesdalean posterior of <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>. He
soon realized his mistake when <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>'s front
wheel, seeing a sizable down slope ahead, declined to go further. Unfortunately,
his rear wheel was quite gung-ho at this time. It was only the catlike reflexes
and low-slung bar of the 'girlie' bike which preserved The Dr's ability to sing
'Old Man River' in the shower. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Trail
Hoover</font> in the meantime, led the way into the first real shiggy in the
form of deep and viscous mud completely covering the low lying areas of the
trail. <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover </font>would lead through with a
minimum fuss. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>would get a mighty start, get
completely mired, and would then topple over sideways into the muck. It must
have been intentional. <font color="#FF0000">Just Rob</font>, a late starter,
reportedly made it to the first real shiggy. He was worried that mud might spoil
his pirate costume, so he turned back to join the crew at the down down. <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, keen-eyed and thirsty,
discovered a B in the trail. And another, and another. And another. And another.
But not a hop or a malt to be seen. This tragedy constituted 'humor' in the sick
and twisted mind of<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo Jovi</font>.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>spent 30 minutes riding a search pattern around each B, exhausting the
beer-deprived <font color="#FF0000">Baxter</font>, and ultimately resulting in
the necessity for a search and rescue mission at the end of the ride.<br>
<br>
The trail, moistened by tears at each of the 'B' marks, grew rougher and wetter.
Some dirt 'half-pipes' were run, prompting <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> to stage an impromptu 'X Games' in&nbsp;
the woods. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> walked his girlie bike.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">
Shine On</font>, doing a two-and-a-half twist double-axel, injured her elbow
(but being on high-dose prednisone, she did not notice the injury until her arm
fell off into a vat of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> Venezuelan Beaver
Ale at the on-on-on, and had to be surgically replanted by <font color="#FF0000">Dr
WHO</font>). <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Trail
Hoover </font>were briefly missing, and when they finally caught back up with
the pack, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover </font>had some suspicious
hickey-like scratches on both buttocks, which she showed frequently and proudly
to all who would look (i.e. everyone). Branches of the Burnt Swamp River were
crossed, the legendary 'Graveyard of the Recreational Vehicle&quot; was passed,
Woonsocket was entered using the secret route the French-Canadians used in order
to escape the border guards at the turn of the century.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just when it
seemed that this was going to be a memorable trail, the marks led out on Sumner
Brown road, turned north on Burnt Swamp Road, west on West Road in Sheldonville,
and back to the cars. All pavement, and substantial use of SIDEWALKS! I'm
surprised <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> didn't lay out training wheels at
the beginning of the hash! [Actually<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo,</font> that's
not a bad idea, for your scribe, at least. Think about it for next time.]<br>
<br>
After the dramatic and heroic rescue of 'The One-Eyed Boom Boom' and Baxter, the
down down was joined in the woods next to a scale model of Joe's Rock. The hare
received marks which defied prediction, considering the heinous nature of the
'Case of the Missing B's'. True, blood was spilled, shoes were wet and
malodorous, and<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> got lost. But positive
scores? I ask the hashing world, after reading this true and notarized account
of the events as they unfolded, to send in their opinions of a suitable
punishment for a hare to <a href="mailto:rih3@bondosadope.com">rih3@bondosadope.com</a>.
A down down was given to the hare using his &quot;My Little Pony&quot; dixie
cups, and he performed a creditable two cup waterfall. Next, the virgin <font color="#FF0000">Just
Rob</font> entered the circle, where he knew his name, was made to cum by
someone named Debbie from Dallas, and thought the square-root of 69 was 3! Where
do we get this talent, on an almost weekly basis lately? He was told the charge
for the run would be a gold tooth, and having plenty to spare, he went off to
get his pliers, but unfortunately became so fascinated by Joe's Rock that he was
not heard from again. All present were nominated for the hashit, requiring the
use of the RIH3 applauseometer. The needle was broken at Short Peck, whose crime
of rescuing <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>narrowly defeated <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font>
beer crimes, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO's</font> girlie bike, the sight of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS's</font>
naked legs, and <font color="#FF0000">Shine On's </font>recidivism.<br>
<br>
The on-on-on at <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> was attended by the hard
core, who at last got some beer, as well as some excellent <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
chili and macaroni salad with limited singing, and reproachful glares from Ben
and Jake, who in their capacity as management of the RIH3, decided to fine all
members of the hash $25 for not being allowed to come (the aforementioned sum to
be paid at the next hash to<font color="#FF0000"> Dr WHO</font> as acting
treasurer, since Bondo is obviously untrustworthy). As always, a time was had by
all.<br>
