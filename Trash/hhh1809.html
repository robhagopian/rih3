RUN: The dark descended very quickly as hashers congregated. The Hare was waiting and offered liquid nutrition prior to the run as she knew she had prepared a devilishly long run. She stirred feverishly her cauldron into which she threw Bondo brew, roadkill, flour, orange food and tissue from Baskets discarded lyme-infested aorta. She planned to serve this at the BC.<br/><br/>
A neighborhood coyote ran over to eat some of the hashers, but Cock/Basket put a spell on it and it was soon on its back pining for a tummy rub. Tommy Ramone/WHO did the same hoping to get a belly rub from the harriers, but was kicked in the nuts.
With a wave of her wand, she directed the hashers into the woods.<br/><br/>
The trail weaved through the evil dark forest. At the various checks, there were spells. Just celebrating getting old-er, and wiser, Piggy/Rusty sussed the spells out and was able to short-cut, as was the Cockman/Basket. Having lived in woods in his native Kazhakstan/Pakistan, Borat/Oozing, he didn’t fear the forest, and followed. The tree wise-men ran into the hare pulling the beer out of the woods.<br/><br/>
The rest of the pack followed Ace/JTP who foolishly ran in circles.<br/><br/>
Tirty minutes later, they joined the tree stooges at the BC.<br/>
Brew was consumed, snacks devoured.<br/><br/>
A short walk back to the circle and more witches brew and dastardly evil treats to consume<br/><br/>
Down downs for the hare, and two timers, and Rusty the birthday boy!<br/><br/>
Best costume to Crotchy-though Borat lost by only a few million popular votes and there may be a recount.
Worst-dressed to JtP-Ace Ventura.<br/><br/>
Hashit inexplicably went to Oozing for leaving the circle to get the hashit. You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don’t! Oozing was damned at birth.<br/><br/>
OnIN had at Fieldstones-large attendance, well spread out.<br/>
And we had a fine Oban 14-year old to celebrate Rusty's 60th!!<br/><br/>
