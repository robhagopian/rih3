<p>What a great night for a hash!  Anticipation had been building for days, weeks, months even (ok, how about not at all) 
as it would be the birthday celebration of one of the most acclaimed, big, distinguished, eminent, famed, glorious, great, 
high powered, illustrious, immortal, important, large, laureate, lionized, notable, number one, numero uno, outstanding, 
popular, pre-eminent, prominent, renowned, revered, storied, and well-known Scottish poets, Robbie Burns.  The morning 
broke with promises of up to 8 inches (same thing <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> tells the ladies) of snow in 
northwest RI, but sadly the front moved through quickly leaving a disappointing 3 inches at best (again, like <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>).  Pathetic!</p>

<p>So excited to celebrate Robbie’s birthday were <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> who arrived far too early, but apparently managed to occupy themselves until the pack arrived (strange, at the 
beer check they discussed seeing “Brokeback Mountain” together – could this be the start of an alternative 
relationship?).  And what a sight the pack was!  Kilts and beanies as far as the eye could see.  Except for <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>, who apparently thought they were above the rest of 
us coming dressed in standard garb.  Pathetic!  While waiting to be given the direction for the on-in, <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> reached towards his man purse/crotch and offered<font color="#FF0000"> Cum Under</font> a 
“wee nip.”  All gave a sign of relief when up came a flask, as the alternative would surely make most sick.</p>

<p>After a few rounds of whiskey and a little <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew the pack departed eastward into the 
park.  The hare had decided to use staple yellow post-its to the trees to mark trail (which <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> pondered using for his trail next week -pathetic!), which was sneaky as plenty of light-color lichen was 
around to lead the pack astray.  By the way, did you clear the use of those post-its from work <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font>?!  The first check led us to a trail where the FRBs went right and left.  Not hearing an on-on for some time, 
the hare recommended heading straight into the woods.  The hare, giving hints?!  Pathetic!  After true trail was found we 
bushwhacked to a check where the pack headed north (at least left, not sure if left was north but let’s go with it).  
After bounding down the snow packed trail we arrived at a place I’m sure most hashers would feel at home, a trailer park.  
Or maybe a camper park, but let’s go with trailer park.  Downhill we went from the reflector’d up mobile homes up to a 
river’s edge.  Water?  Snow?  Cold?  Great.  Was <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> trying to get people wet in 
retaliation for falling into water in <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> hash a few weeks ago?  Only <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> knows, but the few, the brave, the manly (despite the kilts) decided it best to hop, skip and 
jump across the raging shiggy along true trail.  The ladies (<font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>) followed trail a bit farther downstream to cross a bridge.  Pathetic!  Somewhere around here we managed to 
find the beer check which was located at “Shepard’s Hut.”  How fitting.  The first hashers to arrive dashed into the 
stone-walled hut to hide from the others, but of course this didn’t work.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> attempted 
to ad-lib a song by replacing words with those of a Scottish theme, most laughed.  Not at the song, but at <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  The oddity continued - the beer check was rather quiet and “click” like.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> talked about concealed weapons.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> talked about 
this year’s Dragon Boat theme.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> pissed uphill of the pack, like ususal.  And <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> went into a tale of them seeing Brokeback Mountain.  
No singing?  Pathetic!  After consuming some adult beverages the group carried on, managing to circle jerk through more 
campers until the main road was hit leading back to the cars.  Pathetic!</p>

<p>The circle made up for some of the lack of singing as the hashit (<font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> for wearing tights) 
fired up a pathetic(!) rendition of the Engineer’s Dream which everyone took as a reason to sing whatever song they 
wanted.  It gave most of the hashers aural (unfortunately not oral) pleasure to hear so many songs at once, and made it 
that much faster we could get to the on-on-on.  Just before the group left, <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font> stated she 
would not be able to hare the hash next week (pathetic!), which most took as a sign of it being that “special” time of the 
month.  Tampon song ensued, yadda yadda yadda.  No <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font>, lack of real snow, warm beer at 
the check, circle jerk trail, non biodegradable post-it notes. Total: <b>+69</b>.</p>

<p>The group proceeded to Chester’s where they were told that haggis would not be allowed into the establishment and that 
consumption would have to occur in the parking lot.  Pathetic!  Makes sense – does anyone really want the smell of haggis 
floating around?  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had managed to keep the delicacy warm inside his cooler (how odd 
that a “cooler” could also keep things warm!) and after dumping on a jar of gravy the hash was licking their lips in 
anticipation of the wonderful treat.  Wow, a few big words were in those last sentences.  Sorry about that.  Anyway – the 
few, the proud, those undisgusted by ground up beef innards and other various animals enjoyed the <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>-made meat product.  As the hash slowly departed I’m sure that most wondered if Robbie Burns would have 
approved, and I’m sure some wondered – who is Robbie Burns again?!  Pathetic!</p>
