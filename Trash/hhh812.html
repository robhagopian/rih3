<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF"><i>The Run:</i></font></p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p><font face="Arial">Under the bright city lights of the East Providence 
equivalent of Sunset Strip, the group gathered with the usual lack of insight 
and intelligence. Once again, the d'erections given by the hare were in secret 
code according to the RIH3 standard of &quot;do-the-opposite-of-whatever-the hare 
says.&quot; Take 195 W (i.e. E) to 44 w (i.e. E), etc. In spite of these efforts at 
misdirection, <font color="#FF0000">Ever(the Eager Beaver)Ready</font> arrived 
early followed by <font color="#FF0000">Async, Dr. W.H.O.</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi.</font> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Each had a story about someone who 'might' make the run 
this night to liven the monotony of running with the usual crowd of half-wits.
<font color="#FF0000">Deep Throat </font>was going to try to make it from 
Boston. <font color="#FF0000">Compusex</font> was sure to come, being that he 
had appeared on the Hareline. <font color="#FF0000">Dr W.H.O.</font> promised 
that half the Department of Family Medicine from Memorial Hospital had sworn 
that they wouldn't miss it for the world. As 6:30 approached however, it 
appeared that the only new or return players this night would be the Police 
Squad.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The persistent patrolman who had been foiled last week by
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. W.H.O.'s</font> amazing trail-setting abilities in his 
efforts to stop hash-terrorism along the Route 44 corridor was seen driving 
East(West) on 44. He returned, making passes down the road both East(West) and 
West(East)with increasing frequency. He slowed more with each circuit past the 
&quot;Park and Drive&quot; where the group of aging men carrying flashlights, a single 
woman and two over-sexed male Labrador Retrievers stood attempting to look 
innocent. Fortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>had not arrived, so 
the group was able to convince the officer that they were the travelling company 
of the East Providence Chorale waiting for the minivan that was to take them to 
a performance at the First Baptist Church. Jake's ability to harmonize on &quot;There 
was a little bird...&quot; was especially convincing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">They started promptly at 6:30, heading North(South) into 
the woods. The woods soon were seen to consist of equal parts of fallen 
branches, briars and discarded auto parts. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
took the lead until he became almost irretrievably entangled in a large vine 
choked briar bush. This allowed <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> to take 
point, until he tripped and fell into a discarded rusting barrel of fuel oil.
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and EverReady took over, following the 
hyperactive Ben into several blind trails until, like a bear-sized mucus-powered 
locomotive, the ever-viscous Baxter charged through the pack onto the true 
trail. A feeble bugle was heard in the distance. Moments later, a disheveled
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived, with a pathetic story about falling 
at the first hill on the trail in a puddle of Baxter's spoog [Note: the proper 
medical terms will be used, wherever practical.] and nearly losing 
consciousness. Lying alone in the woods on the brink of a coma, he realized that 
this was actually his normal state, so he continued.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The trail led through more thorns into more thorns, this 
time immersed in mud. No actual human paths were encountered. All the flour 
marks were on animal trails; some deer trails perhaps but mostly rodent warrens, 
based on the height of the thorn arches under which the hapless bunch had to 
crawl. Uphill slightly, they ran. The thorns began to clear slightly and they 
came to the southeast(northwest) side of some playing fields and a playground. 
In the distance, wearing white clothing, a lone figure was seen on the fields. 
It was performing some kind of strange ceremony in the dark, running a short 
distance, right arm windmilling, then throwing a ball at three sticks in the 
ground. Fearing Satanic rituals the group moved on rapidly, Basket sounding 
retreat on the bugle. The figure responded with a note from his slide whistle. 
It was <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>! The group ran away faster. 
Northeast(Southwest).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally, the East(West) bank of the Ten Mile River was 
reached. A check by the banks of the river was followed across only by
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. The rest, noting the dryness of the hare's 
pneumatic body armor, held back and were rewarded as the hare indicated true 
trail along the bank. It appeared that the hare, as a present to
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> for 
their birthdays, was willing to lead to the true trail at checks. It turned out 
that this didn't help much because the hare himself couldn't remember which way 
to go most of the time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Another check past a right(left) turn in the river and the 
trail led briefly south(north)across a log at the deepest and most noisome part 
of the raging flood. The hare had greased the far end of the log with leftover 
turkey fat from Thanksgiving. In spite of this, the hashers all made it across 
safe and dry. Only however, to be soaked by the dogs shaking themselves off in 
proximity to each runner as he or she was trapped by the next gorse bush.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">They ran briefly east(west) and finally came upon an old 
road at a check. Heading northwest(southeast), <font color="#FF0000">Async, 
Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> began to pick up speed. 
Soon they encountered a chain strung at ankle height in the road. This had 
obviously been placed with the specific purpose of catching people running full 
steam in the dark with their flashlights off to conserve battery power. It 
worked. Dr. WHO fell, seriously fracturing and denting the underlying asphalt.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket, EverReady</font> and the hare missed this fun, 
curving east(west) back towards the river, exiting the woods at the dam by the 
East Providence Water Works and the 'John Hunt' House. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Crossing 114A, the group regrouped in confusion, and while 
searching for true trail encountered a lone jogger, <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Emily</font>. She had planned to join the group for her first hash this evening 
but at the advice of <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, she had read the Hash 
Trash. Seeing a picture of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and comparing it 
to Osama Bin Laden, she grew afraid and decided she'd better scout it out first.
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO, EverReady</font> and the hare greeted her warmly, 
and invited her to join in. She ran briefly with the group but soon noticed the 
trail of blood left by the thorn-scourged legs of the hashers, and decided 
against it for some reason. [As an aside, it is always difficult to recruit 
medical professionals to the hash, given that most are reasonably intelligent 
and trained to avoid injury in all situations. Fortunately for the RIH3, both
<font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing SD</font> 
got into medical school through Title XII, little known legislation that demands 
equal opportunities in medical education for the simple-minded and confused.! ]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">True trail led north(south) along the banks of the James 
V. Turner Reservoir, where there was no flour because the hare had seen a woman 
walking her Pekinese while he was out, and he was afraid that the dog might 
become enraged at the sight of white powder. But it was a wide open path, 
groomed and free of obstacles all the way to Newman Ave. <font color="#FF0000">
Dr. WHO </font>only fell twice. Crossing Newman, the trail at this point 
consisted of the sounds of Oozing's slide whistle at the beer check, 300 yards 
ahead on the shore of Central Pond, at the beer check. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> had taken the hare's directions seriously and by reversing 
everything, running backwards holding a mirror, he had successfully found the 
beer check without seeing a thorn. For the first time all had gathered together 
successfully. It was very depressing. But it didn't last long for the hare had 
economized on beer, and after a short break with no singing(!) it was on 
west(east) to Redland Ave. where they turned south(north). The runners! spread 
out with <font color="#FF0000">Async, Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Dr. WHO</font> leading, until <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> stopped at the 
fields to pick up his wickets and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> fell into 
a holly bush on Pawtucket Avenue. After a jaunt of two-tree miles, a left(right) 
turn onto a grass road led to the starting point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At the circle (before it was called to disorder)
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, obviously deranged by the consumption of 
the hare's &quot;Saranac Caramel Double Mocha Malt Stout&quot; began to sing: &quot;On the 
first day of Ramadan...&quot; He was only shut up (on the fifth day of Ramadan) by 
the combined vocal stylings of the rest of the hashers singing: &quot;The Monks of 
St. Bernard.&quot; Hare in the circle. He received excellent ratings: 12F from Bondo, 
whines about pavement from <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, &quot;Most blood-loss&quot; 
from <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, &quot;Good shiggy&quot; from
<font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>, &quot;Best trail-run-in-reverse of the year&quot; 
from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and complaints about the beer from
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Total: 6.9! He sang a song about the 
dangers of promiscuity and onto the hashit. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, 
hashit in absentia from the preceding week, nominated the hare,
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. By 
universal acclaim, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> again was proclaimed 
hashit and felt the sinking feeling of shame and remorse that accompanies this 
dread award, and which silenced him in embarrassment for close to 0.69 seconds. 
A song about a virgin in ole West(East) Virginny, Hash religion and the circle 
was over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The hare was understandably torn about the choices for the 
on on on. Last week at Tort's the group had had reasonably priced pitchers of 
Guinness, acceptable food, and pretty waitresses and barmaids, as well as 
Britney Spears. On the other hand, the Red Bridge Tavern offered pints of 
Guinness, FREE food, no waitresses, and seven or eight fat hairy guys in smelly 
sweatshirts with their butt cracks hanging out in front of the bigscreen 
swearing at the top of their lungs at their favorite football players. In the 
end it was no contest. We hope Britney didn't miss us, but a buck, after all, is 
a buck. And that was the gift of the hash to the two birthday boys: $500 in Hash 
Cash from the GM's printing press. We need an AGM soon.</font></p>
