<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> High 70’s, Clear and Dry</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Dr W.H.O., Oozing S.D., SESYB, Bondo Jovi, Fuwangi Boner,

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hare began on an auspicious note when his d’erections for the start led to a gated lot at the girls softball 
field on Reservoir Rd in Johnston. There is nothing like the feeling you get after running a hash and returning to find 
your car trapped behind a locked gate in a field in the middle of nowhere. At any rate, he redirected the arrivals to a 
small dirt lot at the side of Reservoir Rd. overlooking the ball fields.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, Fuwangi</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> began playing soccer in the traffic. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> locked 
himself out of his truck. Then he dented <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> car door while breaking into his own 
vehicle. <font color="#FF0000">General Sperm Gurgler,</font> a ex-military visitor from Heidelberg, watched in 
amazement. Promptly at 6:30 they were off (running as quickly as possible because they hoped to be gone before <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>a rrived).</p>

<p>Trail set off behind the softball fields. The hare left a giant flour arrow by the cars to indicate this, thus ensuring 
that when <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>did arrive, he would head in the opposite direction. This is in fact what 
happened (although to be fair, he might have had more fun than the rest as he headed west into the Johnston Land Fill). 
But the pack entered the woods going east and then turning north.</p>

<p>The trail was mostly bushwhacking, with a few areas of briars and poison ivy to make things interesting. But there was 
no unavoidable water. There was no water at all. There were the usual number of falsies, although none were as prolonged 
as one could usually expect from this hare. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>and the visitor traded the lead mostly, 
with <font color="#FF0000">WHO </font>on their tails, and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>on <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB’</font>s tail. (He’s not as dumb as he looks.) <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was suffering 
from an acute overdose of World Cup soccer watching, and kept kicking at the patches of flour, hallucinating soccer balls 
as he ran along. As they ran further north, they kept having tantalizing glimpses of the Jillson (Almy) reservoir. They 
were sure that a swim would come. But it was not to be. The hare had planned for many a dry mile, and there would be no 
relief for the dry and dusty hashers this night.</p>

<p>The group crossed a small (dry) stream and began to make their way northeast. There were some paths, some deer trail 
and some frank bushwhacking. But no water. They came to a gas pipeline which turned slightly south of east. There was some 
standing cracked traces of mud in the middle, but you’d have had to be pretty inventive to even moisten your shoes on this 
trail.</p>

<p>They ran the pipeline for what seemed to be an eternity and then made their way into a neighborhood on Woodlake Drive. 
They re-entered the woods quickly however, and turned back north to the powerlines by the Rt 6-295 cloverleaf. South 
again, this time on a prolonged trek through the dry dust of dirtbike trails and powerline access roads parallel to Rt 295. 
Several high (although dry) points promised to be likely beer checks, but not yet. The long straight trail made the group 
spread out widely, with the fit (<font color="#FF0000">GSG</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi)</font> leading <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> past a bloated and festering carcass of a large deer (obviously the victim of dehydration), 
while <font color="#FF0000">Tinker, Oozing, SESYB</font> and the hare followed more leisurely.</p>

<p>Just before Central Pike, they crossed the Dry Brook. Aptly named, too! A “BN” was seen. They crossed the road and 
climbed the powerlines to the top of a rise. They saw a “B” and began to search for the beer. It was a lovely spot. There 
was a dry breeze. In the distance, shimmering in the dry heat, rose the majestic Johnston Landfill. [There was a small 
moving cloud of dust seen at the Landfill, perhaps marking <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> trail at that moment. 
But I digress.] As they found and sipped their first beers, they began to count the ticks on their persons. Everyone had 
at least six or seven, and some had even tried to penetrate the hare’s armor. The ticks weren’t looking for blood, they 
just wanted to drink some sweat, it was that dry!</p>

<p>A few songs were sung, and the beers finished off. The group was directed back to Central Pike for the long and dry run 
west back to the cars. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was sitting in his car, sleeping. He was awakened and began his 
usual stories, fabrications and excuses. He was dismissed to go back to rescue the dry and fading dogs with <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. They were finally all present, and circled up across the road in some (dry) bushes.</p>

<p>Ratings for the run were terrible: too dry, poor weather, dryness, no losses on trail, missed reservoir opportunities, 
too long, etc., etc. But giving back points for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> missing the run, and 1 point for each 
tick on the hashers: total: 0.69. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for again attempting to kill the 
Grandmaster. The visitor could provide no excuses. Religion was held and they moved on to the Bishop Hill Tavern on Rt 6, 
where they ate well, and amused a pair of aging Italian Wise Guys and their teenaged hookers with some classic songs 
(once the food was served). They even heigh-ho-ed out of the restaurant. But throughout the meal, no one had to use the 
rest room because they were too damn dry!</p>
