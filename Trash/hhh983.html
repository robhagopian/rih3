<p><font color="#008000">Run #983</font>, Feb 7, 2005.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> The Slasher Dr W.H.O.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; North Cumberland Middle School</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 30’s, Clear, Still plenty of snow.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy, Async, Basket Boom Boom, Oozing SD, Seamus.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Not Present (week 5):</font>&nbsp; Just Ariana.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>An incredible virgin run, as expected, beginning at the North Cumberland Middle School, as the hare set a 
clockwise circle of about 4 miles for the pleasure of the hash. Starting eastward on Nate Whipple Highway, the 
trail quickly led onto an abandoned road and then turned south uphill through a vacant lot. Marks were footprints in 
the 6-8” of snow, flour on trees, and black chalk on the snow. BRILLIANT!</p>

<p>At the top of the hill, a check sent <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> north into the Beagle Club firing 
range. Unfortunately, it was closed for night shooting because of the snow. Not every plan works out perfectly. 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> took the lead into the woods where a maze of trails was encountered. 
Check after check was messed up by whomsoever was leading at the time, as they continued south and west through 
rolling hardwoods, on trails and deer paths. The pack was forced to stay together by the clever and intricate 
markings of the hare. FANTASTIC!</p>

<p>Crossing some streams they turned slightly north of west at a house whose owners quickly dowsed their lights when 
they heard the commotion. The trail led along a ridge, past a tire dumping ground and to an abandoned apple orchard 
where <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> followed their instincts. Obviously, 
they turned west off-trail, back to the Beagle Club. They drew the <font color="#FF0000">Fairy</font> with them 
briefly. Fortune favors the blind, so <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>somehow found trail continuing west across 
a stream, and turning northwest over more rolling hills. He passed a “BN”.  He passed a “BVN”. He passed a “BVVN”. He 
would have passed the “B”, except Seamus saw it and held him back. But he had no luck finding the beer.  <font 
color="#FF0000">The Fairy</font>, next to arrive, walked straight to the beer, “hidden” in the crack of a large 
boulder. Stout and IPA in great quantities, UNBELIEVABLE!</p>

<p>After the beer was broached and enjoyed, they turned north and ran a straightforward half-mile through the woods 
to the Nate Whipple Highway, and turned east on the road back to the Middle School and the cars.  They circled up 
behind the Middle School in the woods on the Cross-Country trails. Ratings for the run: virgin territory, 
disorientation of <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, no <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, snow-shiggy, and fine beers versus no bimbos, a small amount of pavement, and no 
lost hashers. Total: 6.9! Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, for not bringing the <font color="#FF0000">
B*tch</font>. After religion, they convoyed back to Tucks, for beer, free soup and bread (provided fresh by the 
adoring waitress!) and another fine ending to a Monday night. MAGNIFICENT!</p>
