</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, in typical RIH3 fashion, we started
promptly at 630pm, not waiting for anyone. <font color="#FF0000">Shortshorts(SS)</font>
pointed the pack out down Elam St and the trail was marked with enough flour to
feed the guatemalan village being given refuge by the <font color="#FF0000">Worm's
</font>girlfriend! Across 102 and south towards Narragansett and a right up a
road and soon into the woods after a check easily navigated by the pack led by <font color="#FF0000">Async.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Into the woods and across a wooden bridge to
another check and here a classic<font color="#FF0000"> Tinker-</font>check
baffled the pack for a few minutes before the pack headed back on the trail and
to another trail that led out of the woods, past a teepee (damn Indians
everywhere!), across 102 and towards the library, into the woods, out to Wilson
Park and into the trail that winded around a bit but no one got lost with SS in
the rear, out to the road and towards the water with <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>
waiting with a boat. <i>[Editors note:&nbsp; Yes, that was a single sentence.]</i>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now the water was cold and so all took to the
boat and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> took them across, but <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
braved the cold water and&nbsp; swam across like a fish! &nbsp; What a brave
lad!&nbsp; Across and onto Cornelius Island and trail continued by the shore and
to the BC. The pack enjoyed beer and the sight of wet, naked latino beauties
bathing in the water nearby AND they loved our singing! On the trail back, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and trail elected to take the boat with <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>and
the rest took the short way back to <font color="#FF0000">Tinker's</font>.
Across the bay we sailed and towards the town and under the road and to the pond
behind Tinker's. The circle was behind the house as the unanimous vote was
despite absence of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo/Basket</font> the run was crap! <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
was annointed the hashit (his staff) for his sins.&nbsp; Down downs to the
hares. No &quot;see food&quot; this time as Jah prepared delicious Thai food
which was devoured by all and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> took care of
the rice. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker's</font> neighbour visited with her
dogs-so well behaved it was difficult to believe with the K9s that grace our
runs! A good time had by all...ONON.<br>
