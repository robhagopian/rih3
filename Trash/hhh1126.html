<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Eenie Weenie Dick</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Co-Hare:</font>&nbsp; Justin My Ass</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Providence, the CAPITAL CITY</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 50’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Concrete Feet, Basket Boom Boom, Amish It Head, Just Rebecca, Just 
Zeke, Microhard, Fuwangi Boner, Scatwoman.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>OK. So the d’erections were not specific. In fact, they SUCKED! And no mention was made of a costume requirement. But 
you’d think, it being the Halloween Hash, people might have guessed. Then again, THEY’RE ALL HASHERS! No virgins this 
week, breaking the six week streak. The start was the same as last year’s Halloween Hash; from a parking lot opposite the 
Foundry near the mall.</p>

<p>The costumes? Well, everyone except <font color="#FF0000">Just Rebecca</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet
</font> made an effort (although <font color="#FF0000">Microhard’s</font> effort consisted of carrying around a “Scream” 
mask with a blood pump. Pretty feeble, unless you actually wear the thing during the run. BUT I DIGRESS!). <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> went with a plaid skirt, a button down white shirt and a pink pig-tailed wig, claiming to be 
Britney, but constantly mistaken for a “Wendy’s” spokesperson. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> opted for a diaper and 
a Harpo Marx wig. Not sure what exactly that was supposed to be, but at least it was PRETTY EMBARRASSING! That’s the 
point, isn’t it? And when speaking of embarrassment, late arrival <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> is always sure to 
be a front runner. He wore the too-tight Superman PJs that he tried to push for the Dragonboats. <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> put together a shorts/suspenders/knee-socks thing with a feathered green plastic fedora trying for the 
Irish-German-lederhosen motif. <font color="#FF0000">Just Zeke</font>, even, came up with a Dixie-cup-and-jumper sailor 
outfit. The co-hare? Indiana Jones. The hare? Dick-in-a-box. THEY SUCK! LAME! But then again, so was the entire hash.</p>

<p>They were off promptly at six thirty. Trail was in faint chalk, and more than once during the run, they would need help 
from the hare or co-hare to find the ALMOST INVISIBLE MARKS. They went down Holden to a check, and without hesitating, 
turned left to run under the mall. They entered Waterplace. They came out the tunnel near the Capitol Grille. They crossed 
into Kennedy plaza. Sound familiar? Sound a bit like run <a href="hhh1074.html" target="new">#1074</a>? Well, it wasn’t ‘a 
bit’ like, IT WAS IDENTICAL! They entered Downcity pretty much in a group, pursued by catcalls and propositions. They 
crisscrossed between Washington and Westminster, and at every corner you could see either the hare or co-hare giving 
hints. This was pathetic. The trail clearly SUCKED AS MUCH AS THE D’ERECTIONS! IT SUCKED EVEN MORE THAN LAST YEARS TRAIL 
EVEN THOUGH THE TWO TRAILS WERE EXACTLY THE SAME! IT SUCKED EVEN MORE THAN LOOPY (the girl I adore)! BUT I DIGRESS AGAIN. 
(Too bad for <font color="#FF0000">Scatwoman</font> who had showed up late. By the time she made it to Kennedy plaza, 
dressed as a candy bar (she claimed it was a ‘Three Musketeers’; we prefer ‘Mounds’.), she eventually gave up in disgust, 
turned back to the cars, left a note for <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font>, and let some air out of the hare’s tires.)
</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> were leading. So they were first to get lost. 
As <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> had been hare last year, HE JUST KNEW that the trail would cross to the east side. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> agreed, so they made their way to the Point St bridge in a vain search for marks. By the 
time they turned back, the pack had crossed on the Crawford St bridge and were trying to find marks on Benefit St. The 
DFL’s finally crossed at the appropriate spot, and promptly GOT LOST AGAIN in the WWI Memorial. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font>, mainly by staying with the hare, managed to find their way to 
Wickenden and led <font color="#FF0000">Just Zeke</font> to the BC at the Wickenden Pub. (FRB’s SUCK!)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Rebecca
</font> were determined to find actual marks, the lack of which has never deterred Basket. So when <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> finally caught up, only <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> could be 
convinced to skip the marks and just head for the pub, where SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, there had been a BC the year before! So 
off went <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Rebecca</font>. Where? <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> knows! But what happens at the hash, stays in the hash. And thus it was back to normal: an all-male beer check 
in a bar which very nearly threw the bunch out. WHO WOULD BLAME THEM? After being told for the fourth time (THAT SUCKED!) 
that the group could not go out into the street and blow a bugle to attract the one female member of the hash away from 
<font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font>, they packed up and left.</p>

<p>There was a difficult choice to be made. Go straight back to the cars? Or follow the hare’s trail back? They finally 
decided to humor the hare, knowing that at least this would mean a trip down Thayer Street. In the absence of <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Scatwoman</font> at least, everyone was in costume. So they 
followed trail over to College Hill and ran the Thayer Street gauntlet. Of course, being that close to RISD, NO ONE REALLY 
NOTICED. COLLEGE STUDENTS SUCK! Trail led up Bowen and down past Prospect Park on the 25 yd dirt path that was the ONLY 
RESPITE FROM THE ENDLESS ASPHALT for the entire run!</p>

<p>At this point, trail was abandoned by most, and they ran across Roger Williams Memorial Park, up Smith Street and back 
down Holden to the cars, where a breathless <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Rebecca
</font> awaited. Once all were present they circled up in the back corner of the parking lot, HOPING TO GET ARRESTED! 
Ratings for the run: a complete rehash, pavement, loss of bimbo, and pathetic marks were only slightly counterbalanced by 
the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Total <b>-6.9</b>! Hashit went obviously to <font color="#FF0000">
Concrete Feet</font> for abducting and monopolizing the only femininity (apart from <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>) on 
the hash. HE SUCKS!</p>

<p>Finishing the circle without misdemeanor charges, they moved over to Patrick’s Pub on Smith St. The kitchen was closed. 
THAT SUCKED! But they were allowed to order pizza, and after a seemingly ENDLESS WAIT, they were fed, and had some beer, 
and went off on their separate ways, each wondering how the evening could have gone so wrong. And yet they all still keep 
showing up, week after week. MORONS!</p>
