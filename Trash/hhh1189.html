<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">It is a measure 
of the addictive nature of hashing that anyone ever shows up for a <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> run. Maybe one in ten is acceptable. Once a year, 
maybe, a good trail will be set. (What am I saying?!!) But usually, one leaves 
after a <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> trail with only immediate indigestion 
and diarrhea the next morning to show for it. And this would be no exception to 
the usual rule. But with fresh snow, a new starting point, an invitation to ski, 
even… well, the usual idiots showed up yet again, hoping against 
hope.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">From a parking 
lot on Davison (at the entrance to a new park along the Blackstone) in the 
little hamlet of Hamlet in Woonsocket, the group left promptly. The hare’s 
instructions were ignored. He did warn them that there would be no marks apart 
from ski tracks. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> were on skis. 
The rest had decided to run. A wise choice.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The tracks led 
into some playing fields. Often, the tracks were obscured by ATV tracks, but 
there really was no way to go, except south. They came out to the bike path. The 
lead runners tried as hard as they could to mess up the ski tracks so that the 
skiers would be slowed by ruts and divots. After a mile or so, however, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> put on a burst of speed and moved into FRB position. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> followed, and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> 
lagged back. <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> were nowhere to be seen.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They passed some 
storage tanks. They crossed under Rt. 99. Boy, was this fun. Finally, after 
about 2.5 miles, they came upon the hare, chortling in the middle of the bike 
path. It was the beer stop. The usual <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>-brew was 
broken out, and they waited for stragglers. And, waited. And, waited. Finally, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> showed up, a clear signal to end the beer 
check. The hare told the pack to reverse course and go back the way they came. 
The skiers complied, carrying a few extra beers for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> (and, as it turned out, the latecummer, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT>). The runners stuck with the hare, and walked an 
additional mile or so to the hares truck which was in a parking area just south 
of Manville Hill Rd.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They drove back 
on Railroad St., within sight of the bike path. Someone suggested that they call 
out to the skiers to let them know what losers they really were. This soon 
became a perversion of the children’s’ game “Marco Polo”. “Marco!” they yelled. 
“Homo!” they replied. Ah, too be so easily amused. They arrived back to find no 
one yet in the lot, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi’s</FONT> car parked with the 
rest. There was plenty of time for a change of clothes, a smoke or two and 
bladder relief on <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT> car. Finally, they showed 
up, with tales of a second beer check, new territory, yada yada 
yada.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They drove back 
to the hare’s house to circle up in the unfinished first floor. Ratings for the 
run: snow. There were no other positives. Total: -69! <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> was given Hashit for failing to reach the beer check. 
Having had enough of this, they finished and moved upstairs for some salt-free 
meat pies, and some more beer. And that is more than enough waste of computer 
memory for this one.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
