</font><font SIZE="2"><font face="Arial">On this day in 1919, the US Congress 
established the Grand Canyon National Park. As for the Arcadia, well they left 
that alone to whatever lowlives chose to grace it with whatever activity...And 
so in that vein, the Rhody Hash sans bimbos descended upon the park at the beach 
parking lot.&nbsp; The hare sent the pack across the road and northwards into 
the dark...finding trail, the pack ascended a hill and around the house and soon 
back onto the trail which circled back and across 165 and southwards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">By this time, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was long 
gone. The pack forged forward and thru a few more checks, now circling the pond 
and into neighbouring CT. The trail was well marked for a newbee like
<font color="#FF0000">Surf </font>and soon he veered us off trail and into 
bushwhacking territory. The hash forged forward like the green ooze out of
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> rear orifice, like the greasy drool from 
Baxter's gob, like the syphilitic ooze from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font> 
penis, like...oh I digress!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The pack soon, well... not that soon, arrived at the BC.&nbsp; 
Beer found, the pack enjoyed SamAdams lager under near full moon. Partially full 
that is, for the only one to moon the brave wanks of the RIH3 was Surfin for the 
lager the pack eagerly consumed was none other than the queen of beers, aye 
Budweiser!! The wank!! Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> horn was 
heard in the distance, getting closer, then further and further. Or was it the 
intoxicating feeling of being duped by the relative newcummer!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Beer consumed, the pack set out and followed the one-eyed 
one's trail i.e., <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.&nbsp; How cum you query? 
Well, the left over toilet paper was hanging from tree to tree. And by the 
haphazard nature and left veering tendency, it was quite obvious... The trail 
ventured westward, then north again and soon back toward 165 again.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> horn was heard back at the cars by now. 
The pack arrived back and circled up and drank proper Sam Adams this time! But 
in the distance, across the pond was seen the meandering head light of an errant 
hasher, it appeared it was Surfin's mate. The pack waited and waited but the 
light disappeared. He made it to a neighbour's house and thank Allah it was not 
a Wickford resident, for he drove him back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The ON IN was at some godforsaken place that didn't serve 
grub, but the hare came to the rescue by going out for some frozen pizza. 
Hmmm... will the two bods and a cod do any better than this. But then again, 
they're not charging $7 either...</font></p>
