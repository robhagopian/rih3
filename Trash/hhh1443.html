Run # 1443<br/>
Tucked away in Big River<br/>
November 25th 2013<br/>
Hares: Pubic and Donkey<br/>
 
Pack: Basket, WHO, HMD, Bondo, Oozie, SheMailMan, WIPOS, & Rusty (for a while)<br/>
 
Hashshit in abstentia: Rusty<br/><br/>
 
It was the usual Monday routine, check the website for directions, print them and then do my own Google map directions because the hare and Basket never get it right, then I charged up my GPS packed my warm woolies and looked forward to another Pubic & Donkey run. The trip over the bridges lacked excitement, although looking at the clock I was getting anxious about arriving too early. It was 5:30pm, perhaps I had time to stop & do some pre-Black Friday shopping en route.<br/>
 
I continued and made it to Rte 102, I continued further to Rte 3 and missed my turnoff  because it was soooo f’ing dark. I backtracked to Rte 4 and headed north for Exit 7, trusting directions from the hare, alas Rte 4 North only has an Exit 7A that leads to Quonsett and the time was now nearing 6:15 so a twinge of panic was setting in. Quonsett looked nice and so did my General Lee 180 degree turn that brought me back towards Rte 4 South. I found exit 7 and continued to the New London Turnpike (NLT), it’s a long road reminiscent of the ones that farmers walk cows on in Ireland. I didn’t see any gun club, and I didn’t make a right turn as described by the hare. I back tracked again, it was 6:50pm and all hope was lost.<br/>
 
Out of the darkness I saw a sign, it was the right sign and it led me to the secret part of the NLT. I continued to the end and found the cars, there was one body twitching in a car and it was WIPOS, had he finally succumbed to the cold or was he just trying to warm himself. He told me that he thought I was the cops, so he was trying to hide his beer.<br/>
 
It was now 7pm, we scoured the area for a clue and found something that resembled an arrow but it didn’t make much sense. WIPOS opted to follow it, this to me meant that I should definitely not go that way so I headed down a path that brought me to Bondo. He had Buddy and was heading back to his chariot, as it was only a mere tree days since he had his appendix removed. He gave me the insider info, Pubic told him there was no chance of a shortcut later on, the run was going to be long, and the temp was dropping. Great, I said to myself as I headed further down the long roadway expecting to hear some noise to my right. Nothing, not even the glimpse of a distant light!!<br/>
 
I finally decided to turn around and make my way back to the start, getting there at 8pm I sent a text to Oozie to which he replied at 9:45pm. I left a note, dreamt of a cold beer and a shooting star & then hopped back in my car and went home. Saved myself a dollar hash cash but I paid $1.66 to go over the bridges.<br/>
