June 11: 1184 BC - Greeks sack Troy; 1770 - Capt Cook runs aground on Great
Barrier Reef; 1957 - 12 die in Train crash in Vroman, Colorado; 1960 - House
collapses on wedding party, killing 30 in Pakistan; 1979 - John Wayne dies of
cancer; 2001 - Timothy McVeigh is executed. Coincidence? I think not!<br>
<br>
At 6:15, in the parking lot at Box Seats, a moment of silence was held. This was
mainly because no one except <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> was there. But
soon <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> arrived, and a confused young
runner took time out from some Swedish contortion exercises to introduce
himself. Just Tom had discovered the RIH3 website, and, being so impressed by
the quality of the write-ups by<font color="#FF0000"> Dr. WHO</font>, had
decided to give the thing a try. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> announced
that he had decided to usurp the hare, and was planning a bicycle hash. He had
therefore left the GM and his partner at home, a crime if ever your scribe has
seen one. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> arrived, and like two elderly
matrons fighting over the last size 40 corset at K-Mart, the two senior
statesmen of the hash snipped at each other, giving the virgin a surprisingly
accurate view of what he could expect from the RIH3. The low numbers were
attributed to the rumor that<font color="#FF0000"> Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>,
thinking this was still <font color="#FF0000">Shine On's</font> run, had headed
to &quot;Pickle Park&quot;, the rest stop on 146 south of Rt 16 in Uxbridge.
There they had met some aging fairies from Holliston. We may never see them
again.<br>
<br>
The trail began across the Farnum Pike, heading northeast, away from Stillwater
Reservoir (Stump Pond). Soon into the woods fresh from the recent downpours, the
mostly washed away blue and white flour shamrocks were seen only occasionally.
The Hare clearly needs to get a new theme. A series of dirt/trail bike paths and
old dirt roads were encountered. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> charitably
chose the wrong trail at every check, allowing the virgin to feel that he was
some kind of hot-shot hasher. Despite instructions that &quot;On-on&quot; should
be shouted when on trail, <font color="#FF0000">Just Tom</font> decided that he
liked to yell &quot;Mark&quot; at each sign of flour, undoubtedly because he was
silently reciting the second Gospel as he ran. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo,</font>
riding/carrying his bike, was harassed by Baxter, and mired in mud so much that
when he encountered a road, short-cut the trail entirely. He did however make it
to the beer stop, second week in a row! The hare had his hands full shepherding
the two runners, who would not have been at all out of place in the Special
Olympics.<br>
<br>
Curving East, uphill, a &quot;Confidence course&quot; was encountered.<font color="#FF0000">
DR. WHO </font>attempted to break the swinging log, <font color="#FF0000">Just
Tom</font> got all tangled in the &quot;Spider's Web&quot; and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
is still trying to figure out what the three wires that start on trees, come
together in the middle, and are attached to trees at the other end, was for. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
came by after the rest had gone on, and tried to ride his bicycle on the
tightrope. He fell, suffering a groin injury which immeasurably improved his
singing voice for the night. Moderate areas of shiggy were encountered, mostly
churned up mud on the bike trails. Not a briar was seen though. Turning south,
the beer check was found under the Rt 116 bridge across the Woonasquatucket
River.<br>
<br>
The hare marked an arrow indicating the need to cross the river, so <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO</font> pointed out that tradition demands that the virgin try all river
crossings first, and that baptism is an important part of hashing. With Presbyterian
skepticism, <font color="#FF0000">Just Tom</font> refused to bite, so the hare
gave up and produced the beer. Bondo arrived, and under the bridge with
gothic-like arches and cathedral-like acoustics, several hymns were sung
including &quot;The Church's One Foundation&quot; (although Basket changed the
words to something about a religious meeting of the Doggies). The virgin drank
Shine On's soda, and resumed his Swedish exercises, marveling at the quality of
the singers, as well as the refined nature of the lyrics.<br>
<br>
On back to the northwest, the trail had more mud. At one point, a small stream
crossed the trail. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, thinking to clean some
of the mud off his shoes, went right in, only to find quicksand. Sinking to his
knees, it looked as if it was all over for the handsome young hasher. <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
evil laughter at the Dr's predicament quickly turned to awe as he extricated
himself with almost miraculous grace. Soon the virgin performed an exact repeat
of the Dr's mud treatment, and the howls of derision could be heard in the
distance again and again. The noise provided sufficient guidance for Bondo to
rejoin the group for the down-down ceremony in a parking lot just south of Box
Seats.<br>
<br>
In the circle, the run received marks reflecting the religious tone of the
evening, with unusual charity and humility.<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo r</font>epeatedly
turned the other cheek. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> would have given
the run a perfect 10 if no one had shown up at all. The virgin declared it the
best and the worst run of all. The hare attempted to claim run of the year, but
was graciously allowed the best run of the evening of June 11, by the trio of
sufferers: with a score of +0.69. Next, virgin in the circle: He got his own
name wrong, liked heifers, and thought that the square root of 69 was 9! We have
not seen such a promising hasher in years. He then performed a creditable rap
version of this write-up, from which your scribe has freely stolen. Hashit was
given to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, primarily because he was not there
to defend himself, and because of his misbehaviour with the legendary
&quot;Thong of Tiverton&quot; the week before.<br>
<br>
Back at the cars, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was found practicing
tantric Yoga with his walking stick. He had arrived late: obviously a good idea
in general with this group. The on-on-on could have been at Box Seats, but the
hare, sensing an opportunity to profit, moved the group to Mowry Park, up the
road a bit, where he served left over Dorito chips, prepackaged potato salad,
and a dead seagull, disguised to appear as roast turkey. The thunder and
lightning served to accentuate the oddity of the meal, and to top it all off,
the hare was hawking some inappropriate T-shirts commemorating the death by
lethal injection of Timothy McVeigh. A strange, but ultimately good time was had
by all, and the wankers who missed it should be green with envy.<br>
