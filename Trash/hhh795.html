Basket, WIPOS, PW, Trail Hoover, Shine-On, Bondo, Tinker,</font> and<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF">The Run:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, the run was to begin at the most bustling
joint in Cumberland, the Gardener's pub on 114. However, as soon as the
management found out exactly who comprised this bunch of old men who run around
on Monday nights, they closed the joint up and declared a curfew in the area. If
only the RIH3 knew beforehand what a shitty run this was going to be we would
have announced our own curfew...<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> arrived, and
in the spirit of making friends, promptly threw water balloons on the hash, who
welcomed it as reprieve from the heat. Talking about heat, the male dogs chased
the female around as if she was in perpetual heat!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At 630pm sharp, the pack was sent behind the
carpark and into the woods to the first check. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>,
shaking off any signs of aging soon was way in front and <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font>
quite unlike himself, took off to find his own trail leading the pack first then
soon off bushwhacking and gone! The rest of the pack dutifully followed trail,
past the nine mens misery and deeper into the monastery. <font color="#FF0000">Async,</font>
sick of the dryness of it all, soon found shiggy and was soon running up and
down in it. The pack managed thru some more checks and soon hit the beer check
at an old familiar construction site, quite possibly the highest beer check this
year! Beer was consumed and the pack was joined by<font color="#FF0000"> Tinker</font>,
but still no <font color="#FF0000">Basket! </font>The hash didn't seem to mind
with the exception of <font color="#FF0000">Shine-On</font> who kept whining
about the missing octagenarian, although me thinks she wanted a shag from a
certain aging K9 atop the mountain!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Beers consumed, the pack ran out and towards the
monastery and some bewildered joggers including an Indian couple who, by the
scare in their eye, thought <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was going to do
them in! Back at the start, Basket was found enjoying a nice siesta. The circle
was in a bunch of poison ivy. Down downs to the hare with a 6.9 rate overall,
never seen before at the RIH3! The hashit&nbsp; passed many hands and paws to<font color="#FF0000">
PW</font>...with <font color="#FF0000">Trail </font>getting it for whining about
the lack of attention /recognition for co-haring last week's run! I believe it
ended with<font color="#FF0000"> PW</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>keeping
one of the seats for replacement in his house. The ONON was at Tuck's, in
Cumberland with greasy food, gentle clientele, flabbergasted waitress and Guinness
enjoyed by all.<br>
