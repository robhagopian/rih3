<p class="MsoNormal">A story of a heroic adventure with the Rhode Island Hash 
House Harriers, as told by the only one person on earth able to recount the true 
and exciting facts of the ‘Night at Black Hut’.&nbsp; You will surely hear other 
versions of the event told by, you know, <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font>, but 
only one person was there with <font color="#ff0000">Ben</font>, alone, in the dark night. 
(<EM>Ed. Note: Five commas in one sentence. Not Bad! WHO else would do 
that!)</EM>    
  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We start our story with a short background of the area. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Black Hut covers a total land area of 
2049 acres. The area is composed of primarily forest land (deciduous 1815 acres, 
evergreen 3.2 acres), wetlands (201 acres), and agricultural lands (14.6 acres). 
The DFW maintains a wildlife marsh (approximately 30.7 acres) which serves to 
attract waterfowl, furbearers such as muskrat, and other wetland dependent 
birds. There are a number of trails that traverse the reserve, and all are 
cautioned to mark their way well, as they are mostly used for hunting and wind 
endlessly throughout with no signposts or directional help.(<EM>Ed. Note: Talk 
about winding endlessly...)</EM>            
           
           
           
           
               
             
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This area has been used by the Rhode Island Hash for its 
Monday night forays on a number of occasions in the past. Most recently,
<font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> on Run 1099 on Aril 23, 2007, with
<font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> out of town, a rare day when he misses a 
hash, but nothing much happened on this date. Even more memorable, a hash by
<font color="#ff0000">Eenie Weenie Dick</font> on January 15, 2007 on a snow 
covered trail that resulted in the entire pack being lost and only by sheer luck 
and <font color="#ff0000">WHO's</font> compass did they make their way out 
unscathed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> was alone in the 
parking lot, at the end of Spring Lake Rd, as I arrived at 6:20. He said he 
would set off to drop off the beer. Moments later we were joined by
<font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Tinker</font>, and 
discussions of a small pack ensued. <font color="#ff0000">Tinker</font> joined
<font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> said he needed help 
carrying the beer and <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and I waited for another 20 minutes, as we were joined 
by <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Just</font> <font color="#ff0000">Margaret</font>,
<font color="#ff0000">Eenie Weenie,</font> <font color="#ff0000">Wee Balls</font>, 
returnee <font color="#ff0000">Matt</font> (<EM>Ed. Note: That would be, i believe, Just 
Max.)</EM> and virgin <font color="#ff0000">
Patty</font>. 
(<EM>Ed. Note: I don't care to speculate as to Just Patty's virginity (although 
I am&nbsp;more than willing to investigate), but she is in fact, a 
visitor.)</EM>&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">Patty</font> had seen our marks the previous 
hash in Uxbridge, and found our website for directions. <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> 
showed up just as we started out. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Trail led north then westerly along the main trail that 
would eventually make its way to the other end of Spring Lake Rd, venturing near the Mass 
line. A few checks put the pack off in a few directions, but I continued along 
the main trail, and called the pack on. The next check would send me southerly, 
along a smaller trail that wound briskly between trees and puddles left over 
from the storm that dropped 4 inches of water. Many of the older marks were 
washed out, so I continued straight hoping to find a sign that I could call the pack 
on. Soon I heard <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font>’s whistle and a few OnOn’s along the main trail. 
I pursued my direction, knowing that we would either make our way to Spring 
Lake, the directions I was generally heading, or somewhere in the woods off to 
my right. (<EM>Ed. Note: The above paragraph would seem to the uninformed to 
imply that Basket actually had a clue as to what he was doing. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. Reading between the lines, it is clear that he was 
blundering along, starting at shadows and following little bits of quartz, 
thinking they were flour. Too bad that whistle is so damn loud!)</EM>      
              
              
      </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;It’s been a while since I rode 
horses with my daughter and friend in this area. Jody rode on a quarter horse 
she raised from a foal, Chip was on Lady, and I rode a appaloosa named Oreo. He 
was a gelding of 15 ½ hands and a real challenge when Lady was in heat. The 
trails back then were less engraved, and mostly small deer trails. The area was 
once a source of granite, with a number of quarries mined in the early settling 
of the area, supplying the construction of the town hall, bank and many of the 
richer families’ farm houses. Some of these quarries were now filled in with 
water, and resembled more a green algae bloom of stagnate water then the 
industrious activities presented back then. The old blocks, that were not hauled 
away, were left strewn in piles throughout the area. Some at the top of long 
drops into the pond, and others just left to be covered by the forest. (<EM>Ed. 
Note: No. This one is just too damn easy!)</EM>            
                
                  
               
              
               
             
              
            
               
               
       </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I could hear <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>’s horn off 
in the distance, and bushwhacked towards the pack. As I got closer, I could see 
the lake through the trees and new at once that the beer stop would be at the 
old Girl Scout Camp along the shore. <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> was off 
to my left as we both converged upon an arrow pointing towards the noisy pack, 
now cooling itself in the water.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The beer was held in small 12oz 
plastic bottles, formally used for Poland Spring water, and floated just off 
shore about 6 feet from the edge. Not wanting to soil the water with my dirty 
shirt and shorts, I place them upon a nearby rock and dove in for some 
refreshment. (<EM>Ed. Note: Read "...I place them upon a nearby rock so I can be 
naked in front of some girls. Whoopee!")</EM>          
               
                
         </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A number of songs were begun, as we watched
<font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Patty</font>’s dog enjoy the respite from the 
run. There used to be a rope swing here, but only a stump remained. The tree was 
taken down by the previous property owner, to insure against drinking hooligans 
getting themselves hurt. The water was fairly shallow here and strewn with large 
boulders just inches under the surface.&nbsp; If one did not swing out deep 
enough, it would not end happily with the opportunity to break bones or worse. 
(<EM>Ed. Note: As if there was any chance that Basket could distinguish one part 
of the pond from another!)</EM>  
                 
              
            
              
 
              
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The beer finished, we continued on trail 
on a northerly heading until trail ended at one of those quarries. I went over 
the top and could hear the pack just behind me. There were no marks, but I knew 
there would be a road to my right if I went to the north end of the lake, or I 
could make my way to one of the trails to the north/west that led back to the 
parking lot. (<EM>Ed. Note: If he really "knew" all this, do you think he would 
have felt the need to do this interminable write-up?)</EM>          
               
                
                     
               </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> brought the pack through 
the brush on the left, and I could hear his horn sounding as he went to find 
another trail. As I attempted to follow, <font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> came 
around the hill from the south and followed me. It wasn’t long before his heavy 
breathing gave me cause for alarm. It was just a short time agao that 
<font color="#ff0000">Seamus</font> sounded just 
the same way, and he died of heat stroke. We were in high grass and thorny 
briars, and <font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> was constantly getting caught on 
them. I’d have to go back and pull him through, cutting my legs in the process, 
but with little concern for my own well being. <EM>(Ed. Note: What a lover of 
dogs! Does that suggest anything to the reader? Perhaps romance was in the woods 
that night!)</EM>      
                
        </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The sun set early, as the clouds and deep foliage quickly 
filtered what light remained. Without a light and having to go back for Ben a 
number of times, I found myself turned around and lost. I knew if I continued in 
one direction, I would eventually hit a road or trail that would lead us out, so 
I trained my sights on one tree, off in the distance against the night sky. 
<font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> would get caught 
again, and by the time I got back to him, the tree I had focused on was 
undistinguishable from the rest. Total darkness fell quickly.<EM> (Ed. Note: And 
it doesn't help if you're half blind to begin with.)</EM> 
                 
          </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We came upon a small quarry, where 
<font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> could go in to cool 
off. As he swam, I pondered the thought of being out here all night. Even though he was 
panting heavily, he would not rest and continued running around in circles. 
I decided that rather than have him lost again, I would continue moving and hope 
to find a trail in the darkness. I reached down for his collar to keep him in tow, but 
I was 
constantly hit in the head with branches and tree trunks in the dark, as I bent 
over holding him tightly. There were a number of those granite blocks in this 
area, and not a few fallen trees that needed to be scrambled over. Each time, I 
had to relocate <font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> and continue on. I took one step that found my shoe in thin 
air and I tumbled head over heals into a small pit lined with granite. Luckily I 
braced my fall with my hands and saved myself some serious injury. My foot made 
a popping sound, as I twisted forward and landed on my right knee. As I stood 
up, I knew something was wrong with my left foot in serious and blood was running down 
from my knee, but I had to find <font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> again before moving on. <EM>(Ed. 
Note: Could be a title for the movie version of this write-up: "My Left Foot in 
serious.")</EM>   
  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I called him a few times and could hear him whining off in the 
distance. It was a little while before I found him stuck again in briars, but I 
remembered I had a red ribbon tied to my horn from the Christmas Hash. I used 
this as a leash to keep <font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> near and we continued looking for a trail. 
<EM>(Ed. Note: Most of us never go anywhere without a nice piece of red ribbon. 
As well as some rouge, some Midol&nbsp;and an extra maxipad.)</EM>     
    </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I had been blowing my horn constantly, as 
I was sure I would have the pack looking for me by now. They would have gone 
back to my house for some beer and food, thinking I would make my own way out, 
as I usually do. <EM>(Ed. Note: Again, do I really need to comment 
here?)</EM>&nbsp;But this time, with darkness blinding any sense of direction, a 
very painful left foot <EM>(in serious)</EM>, thick underbrush, a dog that kept 
me from keeping a straight course <EM>(sure, blame the dog!)</EM>&nbsp;and a 
very large unforgiving forest, was more than even I could master<EM>(bate)</EM>. 
I thought that may have traveled farther into the forest <EM>(?)</EM>            
                 
                 
             
              
              
        , away from the road 
and they couldn’t hear my horn. Every step brought pain to my foot and
<font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> kept pulling me off balance and around unseen 
trees causing me to fall over and over again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We had been moving downhill, in hopes of finding the lake, 
as I knew there would be a road that lined the circumference on two thirds of 
it. After what seemed like an hour, I only managed to find marshy ground and 
briars so thick I could not manage through it, especially with
<font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> in tow. I decided to go back 
up to higher ground and hope to make my way back on some trails where I may be 
able to see something in complete darkness. <EM>(Ed. Note: He must mean that 
with altitude he would gain mystical super-powers that would allow him to see 
in&nbsp; complete darkness. Or maybe not.)</EM>&nbsp;Being completely blind in 
the woods is not a very safe activity.<EM>(Ed. Note: This is a true statement. 
Perhaps Basket should follow his own advice and get himself a seeing-eye 
dog.)</EM>           
                  
               </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I continued for quite a while and after blowing my horn, 
once again, there was a return sound. It sounded like an “On On” was muffled off 
in the distance through the trees, to my left. I had been hearing a number of 
noises, mostly rain dancing off the canopy falling in the leaf carpet, 
<font color="#ff0000">Ben's</font> relentless 
panting, and the hum of nature in the night. I wanted to be sure before changing 
direction yet again, so I blew my horn loundly. Again the call came back 
somewhere out from the din. <EM>(Ed. Note: "...the din." I believe he is 
referring to some part of the forest where mystical super-powers are 
conspicuously absent.)</EM> 
               
              
       </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We continue towards each other; me blowing my horn, trying 
to keep <font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> in tow and the voice at the other end of the 
black night. I finally found myself out of deep brush and on some kind of trail, 
but in the dark it was not easy to stay on it. I kept having the retrace my 
steps backward to try and sfind the path, as I moved in the general direction of 
the other person in the woods. <EM>(Ed. Note: Spell-check and Grammar-check are 
handy tools.)</EM>          
                  
                  
               
       </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Off in the distance a small light was seen through the 
trees, so I moved in that direction, bushwhacking, with little regard for the path. I knew the 
pack had found me, or so I thought. It was <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font>, alone, with an extra light for 
me that barely reached to light my feet. But I was thankful and hopeful that the 
ordeal would soon be over. I asked him if the rest of the hash was looking for 
me, and he explained that he left them at my house, as they were too busy eating 
to go out and look for me. <EM>(Ed. Note: What's more stupid than getting lost 
by bushwhacking after dark without a flashlight? How about heading off into the 
woods alone to <STRONG>find</STRONG> someone bushwhacking after dark without a 
flashlight.)</EM>&nbsp;I asked if he had the time and he said it was 10:40pm. 
<EM>(Ed. Note: It was in fact 10:40 PM. In Greenland.)</EM>Then I asked if he 
knew which trail to follow, and he said sure. He had laid trail himself here and 
could find our way back to the cars. <EM>(Ed. Note: Trusting Oozing is as safe as 
working with tame animals. Just ask Siegfried and Roy.)</EM> 
                 
                
                 
                   
                 
                 
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ten minutes later, we crossed the same 
path we had been when we first met. We were going in circles, and the night 
would not end quickly for me. The small light I had was useless and I had to 
keep near him to see the boulders that kept popping up from the ground. <EM>(Ed. 
Note: These. of course, are the infamous Burrillville Mexican Jumping Boulders. 
Very dangerous!) </EM>           
                
                   
        Every step brought pain shooting through my 
foot, and as I stumbled on the rocks, I would almost fall over. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> tried every direction, only to wind up where 
we had been previously.<EM> (Ed. Note: If he tried <STRONG>every</STRONG> 
direction, obviously we wouldn't be suffering through this write-up for so long, 
now would we?)</EM>    
         &nbsp;We continued this until we heard 
another horn blast behind us. The Rhode Island Hash had its full of food and 
drink, and tired of watching the USA female gymnastic floor routine. They were 
in second place behind the Chinese, but the girls had made a few minor mistakes that may 
cost them the gold. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Chinese had trained their athletes 
early. Taking them as young as 3 years old an placing them in barrack like 
schools to develop their specialty. Many had no family life or children’s play, 
and all was sacrificed for the good of the state. It’s no wonder they have 
accumulated so many first place finishes, but at what price? I would rather the 
US not win than force our children to give up their innocence. Evidently the 
pack had tired of seeing red at the games too. <EM>(Ed. Note: I think it should 
be clear by now that more than two or three beers went into the creation of this 
write-up.)</EM>         
                
             
               
                
                 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We were all together on trail, led by
<font color="#ff0000">Wee Balls</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Just Margaret,</font> 
with <font color="#ff0000">Tinker</font>, <font color="#ff0000">Just Matt</font>,
<font color="#ff0000">Just Patty</font> and the others all behind them. We made 
our way back to the cars, where <font color="#ff0000">Short Peck</font> had 
called 911 and informed the police that I was lost in the forest and were 
searching for me. They said they would respond if we need their help. He called 
to say I was okay, and then called <font color="#ff0000">Dog Meat</font>,
<font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and the rest of the RIH3. We were 
on our way home.<EM> (Ed. Note: This sadly belittles the well-coordinated and 
carefully planned rescue effort mounted by <FONT color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT>, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>. But 
that's OK as they're pretty embarrassed that they made the effort in the first 
place.)</EM>            
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Circle was ensued and the Hare finally got his Down Down 
at 11:25. Virgin and 2 Timer were next, followed by Hashit. There were many
<font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> thought I should get it, but since
<font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> showed so much singular compassion and got 
lost himself, he wound up with it. I received a DD for keeping
<font color="#ff0000">Ben</font> out after dark. With morning not too far off, 
the pack made its way home, and I finally sat to devour what little scraps were 
left on the table.</p>
