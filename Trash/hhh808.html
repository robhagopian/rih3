<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hare came out of his house at 6 o'clock, and
nervously adjusted his corsets as he awaited the hashers. He was attired in a
charming white gown with a black top (a la Snow White), capped with a first
communion veil, a black wig and a chimpanzee face. Being Woonsocket, passers-by
noted nothing out of the ordinary. At about 6:15, the Halloween revelers began
to arrive led by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>. He was clad in a striking
OR dress, with platinum blond hair,&nbsp; Parisian lip rouge, and carrying a
French-English phrase book. Next, <font color="#FF0000">Eveready </font>pulled
up, dressed with a grass skirt and other enhancements of her charms as a buxom
Hawaiian in search of a lei. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> parked, and
began to adjust his costume, which bore a striking resemblance to... <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>!
[He did add a wide open reptile mask which unfortunately did not conceal his
face and merely made him look like <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> in a bad
mood.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;As 6:30 approached, it appeared that this was going to be it. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
was Grand Marshall at the Provincetown &quot;Have a Gay Halloween&quot; Parade, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
was under arrest for spreading Mad Cow disease in the UK, <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font> was having his skull waxed and Simonized(TM) for Wednesday
trick-or-treating, and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> couldn't come when he
discovered a run in his pantyhose.&nbsp; Just as they were about to leave
however, a small bus turned into the hare's driveway. The famed &quot;Legs and
Eggs Sextet&quot; from the Foxy Lady had heard many stories about the RIH3 from
one of their regular patrons (<font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, you naughty
boy!), and had decided to get some exercise in Woonsocket. They arrived dressed
as the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, spunky minxes prepared for anything.
Instructions were given by the hare: chalk on telephone poles, pumpkins for
checks, and a beer check were promised.<br>
<br>
Off into the streets of Woonsocket they went, side by each, with Mistress <font color="#FF0000">W.H.O</font>.
in the lead, followed by the admiring girls and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, as the sole representative of 'masculinity',
received more than his share of admiration from the visitors. (&quot;Oh, what a
long pink pole you have, WIPOS,&quot; cooed Just Georgina.) <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO</font> and the hare also were subjects of the lovely girls' attention. <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO </font>offered free check-ups to all (&quot;You have such a gentle touch,
Doctor,&quot; sighed Just Marilyn), and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>demonstrated
visions of what &quot;Lesbian Bestiality&quot; was all about (&quot;Oh, you
cheeky monkey!&quot; said <font color="#FF0000">Just Linda</font>).<br>
<br>
The trail led away from the river at first, then curved around and down to River
street, avoiding the usual foray on the railroad tracks. The Blackstone was
followed southeast. A motorcycle gang was seen, headed for Bob's Tavern. Quickly
the Harley crowd was pursued by the busty <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font>.
She had just then gently rejected the advances of Just Ginger (&quot;Oh, <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font>!
You are so firm, yet yielding!&quot;). Now, <font color="#FF0000">Eveready's</font>
chances for a date looked good as the bikers moved into the bar.&nbsp; By
coincidence however, the Woonsocket Dental Association (with BOTH members in
attendance) was having it's annual meeting in Bob's and and the boys lost
interest in her when the dentists began to give a free standing-room only
lecture entitled: &quot;Gum Care for the <a href="hhh808_explanations.html"> Edentulous</a>&quot;.<font color="#FF0000">
Eveready</font> moved back onto the trail, where progress had been halted as <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO</font> searched for Stump Pond behind Box Seats, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
stopped to sing songs of the Old South in his monkey bride costume in Tyra's.<br>
<br>
The crowd reformed, crossing the river at the Bernon Street bridge beyond River
Island Park. Trail led uphill almost continuously from this point winding
through the streets of Bernon Heights towards the fatefully named Mount St.
Charles. Turning onto Willow street, a &quot;BN&quot; was seen and there in the
distance, shimmering like the air over the Johnston Landfill on a hot summer's
day, was the Original Bondo Van! [N.B. The van has been set up as a Hash Shrine
and Museum, and can be viewed by appointment at its current Willow Street
location at &quot;Dave's Import Motors and Pork Pies&quot;, until it is towed to
its permanent location in Rumson, NJ next spring.] All ten runners, the two
dogs, two bikers with a chopper chick, as well as a Woonsocket policeman on the
lam from Box Seats, were able to fit into the van. Beer was consumed. Odors were
sampled (bringing back memories of years gone by, and causing WIPOS to
demonstrate falling backwards from the van twice). Songs were sung. A seminude
game of Twister was played until <font color="#FF0000">Eveready's </font>strobe
&quot;flashlight&quot; (that's what SHE likes to call this suspicious device)
disappeared into someone's anatomy. No one would admit to having it, but the
hare did have a foolish grin just visible under his chimp face.<br>
<br>
Back on trail, turning west, and crossing the Court Street bridge, trail led
into the main part of town. Drivers and pedestrians alike gazed in wonder, and&nbsp;
cries of<a href="hhh808_explanations.html"> &quot;Qu'est-ce que c'est?&quot;</a>,
<a href="hhh808_explanations.html"> &quot;Zut, alors!&quot;</a> and <a href="hhh808_explanations.html">
&quot;Voila le merde de la cochon!&quot;</a> were heard by the hashers amidst the
general honking, and rude gesturing of downcity Woonsocket. Churches were
encountered in great numbers (at least two-tree times). The virgins, feeling
guilty about their actions in the van (some of which are illegal in up to 42
states), dropped out en mass at Precious Blood Church, where a large scale
drive-through Confession and Absolution was being held. Regretfully, the
diminished pack moved on up Arnold street, to Woodland and back down Meadow to
Chez<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font>.<br>
<br>
In <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's </font>garden, like two giant hemorrhoids
inflamed to the bursting point by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>-brew, sat <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font> and the visitor <font color="#FF0000"> Suzie Wong</font>. They had a story about losing trail at one of
the early checkmarks (as if that could have happened on a <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>trail), and so had come back to await the pack. Tinker, blushing under
his platinum blonde wig, had obviously seen <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO's</font>
costume in the distance, and in shame had run to CVS to by flashing devils horns
for himself and his friend. Numerous scratches on the locks showed that they had
desperately tried to get at the beer. Failing this, they sat in the garden
sipping weak cider and cappuccino and telling imagined stories of their own
valor at hashes past.<br>
<br>
The circle was held in the stainless steel &quot;Fortress of Beeritude&quot; in
the basement. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>and the visitor both rated it
&quot;Run of the Year&quot;, and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>was
subsequently nominated for &quot;Hasher of the Year&quot; for having the sense
not to run at all for Bondo's trail. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> gave a
-69, for a shiggyless run, but corrected himself upward by the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket,
Async, Oozing, Short Peck,</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> to
ultimately settle at +0.69. <font color="#FF0000">Eveready</font> confused the
pack with a rating of 9.6, but she was standing on her head, looking in the
mirrored surfaces of stainless steel when she gave the number. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
produced a fearsome and hideous artifact. [Apparently, he had been out scouting
trail and (surprise!) had gotten lost. He only had a plastic spoon with him
because his wife won't allow him to be near sharp objects. With nothing else to
do, and no skunks to train, He had painstakingly carved a log into a startling
likeness of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> using only the spoon. His
plan was to mentally ask the effigy for directions out of the woods using a
hitherto unknown psychic force (Bondo Jedi?).] This &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
log&quot; was produced and proceeded to mystically rate the run an astounding
7F. Songs were sung, the hashit was missing, but given in name to <font color="#FF0000">Tinker
</font>for backsliding. The group Swung Low and moved upstairs.<br>
<br>
The hare had made his stores for some real Woonsocket dynamite, but having 'high
precious blood' and 'very close veins' he realized he had better dilute the
mixture with non-meat protein, so another <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>-chili
was born. He made sure of its toxicity by leaving it out all day at room
temperature to maximize bacterial overgrowth. <font color="#FF0000">Just Big Sh*t
</font>arrived and after greeting the group and eating, resumed her Herculean
efforts at removing the odiferous black ring around the hot-tub which had been
present since<font color="#FF0000"> Basket's </font>last visit at Run #798 in
August. As always, a good time (not to mention an effective bowel cleansing) was
had by all.<br>
