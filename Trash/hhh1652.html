Trail went out one direction to a whiskey stop. Pack was told to go back
to the cars and look elsewhere. This was fortunate as there were to
visiting harriettes who showed up at the normal hash-standard-time which
is, of course, not how RIH3 operates (n.b. Basket promised to update the
website to reflect how RIH3 operates but he hasn't done so yet). After
checking the other side of the Ten Mile River, we went across the road too
and picked up trail. Trail consisted of three 'fingers' that all went
parallel and where two effectively ran into each other with one false. The
third trail was true and led to beer. Circle and on-after - perhaps at LB?
