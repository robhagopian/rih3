Hills. This definitely set the standard pretty low for the hash, as there is no 
water tower in F. Gilbert Hills. Somehow, everyone made it in spite of this, 
perhaps because it is such a familiar place for the RIH3. Even a <FONT

trying to find a beer check in a nice swamp. No luck, and so the trio turned 
north across the road. They picked up a check and some falsies. Finally, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> spotted the “B”. They started searching. There were 
still no audible signs of the pack. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> finally 
spotted the beer atop a steep boulder, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>, 
getting a leg up from <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>, retrieved it. There was 
great rejoicing.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>A distant “RU” was heard. They doused their lights. The thought of 
taking the beer back to the nice swamp crossed their minds and they discussed 
it. It was finally over-ruled, as being too <FONT

through the woods.<FONT color=#ff0000> Flexi</FONT> was first, and blew right 
past the “B”, hot on some trail of his own. <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> 
finally caught on, and called him back. The rest gradually trickled in. Even 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> made it. 
Sad, indeed. And the hare wasn’t very happy with the

been diminished by the short-cutters, everyone got at least one. Finishing up, 
they followed the out trail. True to form, the young and fit got screwed again, 
as they meandered into the west side. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> ran ahead 
on his own, but <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT

anything to praise in this pathetic effort. Total:-6.9! Some more attempts were

Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, as usual. After religion, they 
drove off to Champions on Rt 1. And weren’t thrown out. And that’s
