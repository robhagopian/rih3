</font><font face="Arial" size="2">The start for this most auspicious occasion 
just happens to be the elegant, yet not ostentatious, residence of today’s hare 
Bondo Jovi. Famed around the world for his lackluster trails but superb On On’s, 
Bondo evidently decided to show, those quick to judge, a trail to live forever 
in song and story around hash campfires.&nbsp; The hashers started arriving around 6 
PM, and the Bondo Beer Engine was chugging along swimmingly. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Rhode Island contingent 
included <font color="#FF0000">Async, Oozing, Slasher Dr. WHO, WIPOS, Basket, 
Ever Ready, Face Douche, Dawg Phart, Red Snapper, Beyond Hope, Tinker, Short 
Shorts, Bill the Beak, Anal, Turtle Dust, Itchy Brother, Lilac Roadrunner</font>, 
and new father of twin girls <font color="#FF0000">Little Neck</font>. Some of 
these faces were hard to recognize as the hard life away from the hash has taken 
its toll.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Visitors from Boston, Hardfart, 
Newport and all the way from Philly and Westchester were more than we have time 
to cover here, but notable antics during the hash would indicate the guilty.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">At 6:30 sharp, the horn was 
sounded, the beer engine was disengaged, and hashers assembled for the chalk 
talk. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>explained to the visitors the 
simplicity of Rhode Island markings, questions were accepted, and finding all 
knowledgeable, the hare pointed of off in the direction of the mighty Blackstone 
River. Traveling east by southeast along Meadow Road, we crossed Harris Ave. and 
entered Cold Spring Park. The hare had set many a lame trail through here, and 
no one expected what would happen next. A boat would ferry us across the river, 
in a floating beer stop not a quarter mile from the start. The boats were 
Indonesian long boats, paddled by 8 naked, from the waist up, beautify bronzed 
beauties. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> Beer was everywhere along with 
munches of spicy hot finger food. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We arrived upstream at a the 
rail road bridge, and exited here, then followed flour up over the track and up 
hill into Blackstone Ma.&nbsp; The trail followed an old trolley bed, to a water 
tower and along a high rock cliff overlooking Woonsocket below. It was a 
beautiful sight. With magnificent turn of the century homes, perfectly 
maintained with wonderful landscaping terraces. We mounted the crest of the 
hill, which brought us down to river’s edge at the mighty Blackstone River 
Gorge. This might river powered many mills during the heyday of the great city, 
and the refurbished buildings, that lined this section of the river, told of 
many early successes during the Industrial Revolution. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We continued downstream to the 
old Tupperware Mill, and found more beer and beautiful bronzed beauties serving 
our every whim. Many songs were song, as the stragglers managed to pull 
themselves way from the scenic overlook, and make their way to beer top number 
2. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The horn sounded once again, 
and we made our way down hill to the railroad tracks, where an antique Pullman 
car idling. Its steam engines had been heard over the hill, but none expected it 
waiting there for us. Bondo had outdone himself again. A keg of beer, a warm 
coal stove, and the bronzed beauties serving us, what more could a hash ask for?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The train took us back to the 
Harris Avenue Bridge, and it was a short jog back to <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo’s</font> house, where the garage was decorated with past memorials from 
AGM’s past. Pictures of <font color="#FF0000">Sparks</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Moon</font> hung side by side the photos of the Block 
Island Hash, the Prudence Island Hash, the George Washington Park hashes, the 
Ninigret and Burlingame Park Hash, and many of the Point Judith to Westerly 
Relay Hash. There were many old political posters also, including
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for GM, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
for Hash Cash, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> for Religious Advisor, and
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>for Trail Master. Oh, those were the glory 
days of the Rhode Island Hash.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We settled down for some 
serious drinking and of course the elections for the new Hash Mismanagement 
Team. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, who was nominate acting GM at last 
weeks hash presided over the proceedings. There were a few surprises, as
<font color="#FF0000">Dawg Phart </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Little Neck
</font>threw their hats in the ring for GM, and many of the regulars were loudly 
supporting their candidacy for the open positions. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Speeches lasted well into the 
night, as Woonsocket Dynamites and Bondo Chili were wolfishly devoured.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The final count was not 
complete as of this writing, but exit polls indicate that, sadly,
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was not to be named GM, as his numbers were 
far below the leaders. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Dr. WHO, Async</font> were 
slightly behind <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>, who surprisingly gathered 
much needed support at the last minute from the horny old timers, and the past 
mismanagement team of Jake, Ben and Baxter. An update of the final results 
should be out by Monday evening.</font></p>
