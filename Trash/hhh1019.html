<p>There is something synonymous with the word “hashing” and the word “underachievement.”  This week’s hare <font 
color="#FF0000">Great at Giving Head</font> (<font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>) surely knew this, as the following would 
suggest:<br>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><hr><p>
Date:  Sunday, 12:45 p.m. (day before the hash)<br>
From:  Basket<br>
To:  Dry Foot Fairy<br>
Subject:  G at GH Direction<br><br>
When ‘Head Hunter” (possible RI name for our virgin hare) sends directions to you, remind him that flour on the sides of 
trees/telephone poles/etc will usually hold up during rain storms. This may reduce the ‘it wasn’t my fault, the rain 
washed out my marks – Bondo excuse #34’<br><br>

Subject:  None<br><br>
Hey G@GH,<br>
Um, any word on where the hash will be?  And Basket says to use trees and telephone poles to mark flour, if you don't want 
them all to wash away in the rain.<br><br>

Hey Amish,<br>
Any word from G@GH?  As of 10:30 p.m. Sunday, still no directions to the hash.  Let me know if you know anything.<br><br>

That jackass didn't get back from a wedding in NY until early this AM.  I yelled at him to get you directions tonight - I 
think he was going to head out and get mileage readings.<br><br>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Not since <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> became <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> did any virgin hare show so 
much promise and potential.  Brilliant!  The usual gathering congregated at the parking lot at the JB Hudson Trail Head 
off Ten Rod Rd. (Rt. 165), which is 2.4 miles or 5 miles west of I-95, depending on your information source.  Two Joes 
from Groton arrived, apparently friends of the hare, who were not really Joes, but <font color="#FF0000">Just Jim</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Virgin Jeff</font>.  No bimbos arrived, including the reliable <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font> for the second week in a row, but at least there was a virgin keep everyone amused.</p>

<p>A quick check which must have consumed a pound of flour, and true trail headed north along the JBH Trail.  At the 
second check, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> checked west, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> checked east, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> went north.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> brought <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Virgin Jeff</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Just Jim</font> in tow 
to a long falsie, evident by the “YBF” consuming yet another pound of flour.  Demoralized, the foursome found true trail 
continuing northeast with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> as the FRB with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> close on 
his heels.</p>

<p>Another check was reached near Breakheart Pond, and this was where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> outsmarted 
himself and thought the beer would be next to the pond.  Only <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was foolish enough to 
follow him this time.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> only needed to be fooled once (See Hash <a href="hhh994.html">
#994</a>) before he would never search for trail near Breakheart Pond again.  <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> took turns leading the pack along the banks of 
the creek, overflowing from the excessive rainfall.  Once again, the question was not “if” but “when” they would have to 
cross the stream.</p>

<p>Trail seemed to continue forever heading south and downstream in what amounted to be quality shiggy given the 
deteriorated weather conditions.  By the time trail had to cross the stream, the Groton Boys (<font color="#FF0000">Just 
Jeff</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Jim</font>) stood scratching their heads with <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font> trying to convince them that they’d have to get their feet wet.  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> arrived 
with no such patience and led the trio through the deep end.  Frosty Hollow Rd was soon reached and the hare’s truck was 
parked in an empty lot with savory beer, chips, salsa, cheese, and grapes.  A beer check good enough for a king!  It was 
only fitting that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> were still missing.</p>

<p>As usual, all good things must come to an end.  The lost ones arrived, but to a darkened and beerless check.  It did 
not take long for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to find the beer cooler, despite <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s
</font> best efforts to hide it (did I mention underachievement?) and thus ending the otherwise brilliant beer check.  And 
then a flashlight was seen bobbing down the road.  Who could it be?  Not <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, but a visiting 
<font color="#FF0000">Gator Hater</font> from various south Florida hashes.  As it seems, not everyone in Florida wanted 
to stick around for the hurricane season.  And he brought yet another virgin with him, <font color="#FF0000">Virgin 
David</font>.  As it turned out <font color="#FF0000">Gator Hater</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just David</font> just 
finished the Appalachian Trail, quite literally. [This called for overachievement and an obvious hashit if you ask me, but 
I digress]</p>

<p>After the beer check, the trail led south along Frosty Hollow Rd, then east along Ten Rod Rd. and back to the cars at 
the JBH trail head parking lot.  Much celebration was to be had, and they had it all.  Comments on the run included, but 
not limited to:  TWO virgins!  A visitor!  No bimbos (but that’s a bad thing)!  No dogs (but that’s a good thing, 
especially the lack of Ben)!  No <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (the best thing)!  Total: <b>+6.9!</b>  Hashit went to 
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> for arriving in his suit, even on an bank holiday!</p>

<p>Naturally, the motley cru went to Marks off exit 6 not 6A.  Upon arrival, the waitress pleaded that the singing and 
antics be kept to a minimum, as respectable patrons were trying to enjoy the Monday Night Football as well as the MLB 
playoffs.  Yeah, like that lasted.  Many enjoyed the savory scallop rolls, but not all (when will they learn?).  And with 
that…. NO!  That was not all.<p>

<p>In the hare’s words…</p>

<blockquote><p><i>So RI state’s finest decided to have a little check point on Rt. 165 tonight. Funny thing – they didn’t 
like the 50+ beer bottles that were rolling around loose in the bed of the ol’ Dodge. As a matter of fact, I believe the 
first thing officer #1 said to me was, “Why are there 50 bottles of Sam Adams rolling around in your bed?” I think the 
second thing they said was, “Get out of the truck, put your hands on the tailgate and spread your legs. How much have you 
had to drink tonight?” I said, “More than a few. (which means about a dozen in Jeremy speak)” “Where are you coming from?” 
I said, “Mark’s.” Which the Man instantly recognized and interestingly enough seemed to approve of. As officer #1 squeezed 
my gonads, checked my pockets, searched my waist band, and inspected the insides of my shoes (after relieving me of my 
Benchmade), I explained I was leading a running club tonight that follows a trail, has a “few” beers, then goes to a bar 
for dinner. The million-dollar question of the night came from officer #2, who was searching my cab as officer #1 played 
with my balls. “What are you doing with all this flour?” It was all I could do to keep a straight face and explain the 
truth. I think they actually bought it. They decided to let me go then, but after I drove a mile, I realize officer #1 is 
still holding my Benchmade knife, which is worth more than his life, so I turn my rig around and go back for more. Upon 
arrival at the check point, they were more interested in their next victim, and as I approached #1 came towards me, handed 
my knife over, and then I got the fuck out of there. On-On!!!</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And with that!</p>
