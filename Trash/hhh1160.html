Run:<br> </font>Starting a hash from 
a middle school is best left to Summer when the little ones and their suspicious 
parents are playing at the beach on vacation. So the hare took advantage of the 
opportunity of the end of school and the first hash of Summer&nbsp;to start from 
the North Lincoln Middle School in an underutilized area just east of Rt 99, 
near the parking area of the bike path. With rain early on, and threatened 
lightning, it was ideal hashing weather. Nevertheless, only a small crowd 
appeared; more beer for the rest. At 6:30, they were off, heading south on New 
River Road.<BR><BR>The pavement was an unpleasant necessity, and didn't last too 
long. A check sent them west on Mussey Brook to Old River&nbsp;Road,&nbsp;and 
they soon entered the woods along the banks of Handy Pond. A check sent <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> between the ponds, the rest found true trail along 
the east bank of the pond. Some decent shiggy was soon entered, although the 
rains had only moistened the surface of the dried mud. Another dry&nbsp;RI 
Spring&nbsp;was to blame. <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> led, followed by <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, 
while the hare and <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> trailed along behind. True 
trail crossed a small stream at the south end of the pond, and turned west into 
a maze of dirt bike trails.<BR><BR>The group was widely spread out as they came 
to some powerlines. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> decided to try the lines 
north. There was no trail this way, but there was some shiggy. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, and <FONT color=#ff0000>LFE</FONT> continued on true 
trail, which looped south, then west to parallel Rt 99, turning back north. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> followed the hare. He had forgotten cabfare. 
Finally, by shortcutting and blind luck(?) <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> 
found <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. Must be&nbsp;animal magnetism. They 
missed the true trail arrow that led into the shooting range, but ultimately 
were guided to the beer check by <FONT color=#ff0000>Async <FONT 
color=#000000>and</FONT> LFE</FONT>. The hare had learned his lesson, though, 
and the beer was not found.<BR><BR>The hare and <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> 
finally arrived and the beer was produced. The Beer Check was on a large flat 
rock with a central fireplace, some rough log benches and artfully strewn 
garbage. It was lovely. Some light rain completed the ambience as the beer and 
spiced peanuts were distributed. A few songs were sung, but lacking the 
inspiration of bimbos, visitors, or virgins, this did not last long. They packed 
up and headed on out.<BR><BR>One would think that the trail on-in would have 
been straightforward. In fact it was. This is what confused <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>. They led the 
pack well off mark, and basically circled the pond counterclockwise. The hare 
walked the trail and came out to lead north on Old River Road to a gas pipeline 
that turned back in (through some nice shiggy) towards the School. The beer for 
the circle had been stashed in&nbsp;some bushes on the pipeline overlooking the 
School. They gathered by a large "C".&nbsp;When all had finally arrived, they 
circled up.<BR><BR>Ratings for the run: favorable weather, some shiggy and near 
losses of the pack on the on-in trail were measured against the lack of bimbos, 
the lack of powerline lightning strikes, the pavement and the fact that <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> made it to the BC. Total:-6.9! Hashit was given to 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> for leading the pack on a wild goose trail 
while assuring everyone that he knew these trails like the back of his hands. 
Finishing up, they drove to Pitcher's Pub on Manville Road for some fine 
microbrews and          
 decent food.</p>
