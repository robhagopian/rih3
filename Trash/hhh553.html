<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The venue was Johnston just off route 6, attendees
included Async our hare, Hopeless who has gone back to breast feeding to
give Fergie some relief, but Fergie tells us he keeps biting her nipples.
Congratulations to Fergie, we really didn’t believe Hopeless had it in
him-sucking tit that is. If you find you need more sucking power three
more volunteers available. Also in attendance was Basket and Sajid a new
boot who obviously is still wanting to taste a good beer and yours truly.
Incidentally Sajid is a psychiatrist who claims he has never come across
such a fine example of cranks to observe, just remember run long enough
you will be one also. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The title of run of the year merely is coincidental
that it was the first run of the year therefore nothing worse to gauge
against. The run started from a pull in and quickly led to woods, as usual
your scribe took the wrong turn at the first and following five checks
to find myself in the usual position-last. Basket by shear luck took the
right path on all but one check and was soon so far ahead that his trusty
bugle sounded like a wet fart from a damp paper bag, which is an improvement
from last year, keep eating the baked beans Basket. From woods onto an
open field which quickly led to the Beer check which at this point was
the most exciting part of the run, under a deer stalkers frame in temperatures
very close to freezing point which was confirmed when Basket showed up
with the bugle stuck to the cheeks of his ars, not enough spit I guess.

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">After a beer or three the motley crew headed back
on the on home which was disgustingly short with a noticeable absence of
shiggy. The final 200 meters was a sprint with the human gazelle coming
in first and yours truly overtaking a startled Basket to come in silver
medal position. A circle up proceeded with comments on the run ranging
from crap to OK (new boot). The consensus was minus 2 with the Hashshit
award going to Basket who came in third, he would have got it even if he
had come earlier which we hear from Dogmeat is generally true. The venue
for the on-on was a place called Rustic well off route 44 where the order
of the day was hot wings and shepherds pie, the beer at this establishment
was a little below par a good description would be water with a sniff of
alcohol-piss. A suggestion was made to bring in a bottle or two left over
from the circle up to supplement this overpriced water, yours truly volunteered
to get the grog and somehow managed to bring in two empties and one full
one for which I was duly awarded the Hashshit, what you will never know
is did I drink the two bottles before I came in? The attendees will never
be sure, but I will accept the Hashshit on this occasion as I guess I should
have replaced those bottles which were empty, so did the Snot hoover them
back? A dilemma the Rhode Island Hash will have to live with.</FONT></P>
