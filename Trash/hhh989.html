<p><i>Scribes Note: The extreme and monotonous use of pavement by the hare this week led to an extreme and monotonous 
write-up by the scribe. A simple solution was found, utilizing the miracle of modern computing. With no consideration 
for the extra effort and expense, your scribe has translated the original write-up from English to German. He has 
then taken the German result and translated it back to English. The result is considerably more intelligible than 
the usual. Of note: your scribe has discovered that the German for “hash” translates as Durcheinander, or “disorder”. 
Coincidence? I think not.</i></p>

<p>Achtung! The run began from the park lot at the beginning of the east bay cycle track in OstProvidence, the place 
of assembly of the numerous memorable beginnings (and pathetic the ends) in the past.&nbsp; <b>WHO</b> could not 
forget its first run here.&nbsp; But it is a comfortable point.&nbsp; The weather was mild.&nbsp; The skies were 
free.&nbsp; The potential for material shiggy was minimal.&nbsp; It seems improbably that <b>straight Areola</b> 
decreases/goes back at all, if she did not want to draw use from these conditions.&nbsp; But, <b>Basket</b> 
believes still.&nbsp; The hare was not present.&nbsp; He had driven off <b>Fairy of the Dry Foot </b>mentioned, in 
order to adjust the beer at approximately six.&nbsp; Nobody wanted to wait.&nbsp; There was an arrow beginning.&nbsp; 
So they were out with the 6:30, descending west by the thorn-loaded wood to the Fat Point.</p>

<p>An examination at the dirt road at the lower surface of the hill had the group stymied nearly immediately.&nbsp; 
<b>WHO</b> went northeast, but gave above (too early) after two markings.&nbsp; <b>Oozing</b> and <b>Fuwangi</b> 
designated the group southwest, after they had found three markings.&nbsp; They required the others.&nbsp; 
<b>Bondo</b> and <b>Basket</b> with dogs emerged from the thorns and caught up, as the leaders, that were returned 
to the extended of the falsies hare by one.&nbsp; <b>Async</b> embraced alone the coastal line and burned through 
through to align around trace in the same direction and ignored the cries.&nbsp; He ignored also the attack dogs in 
the boat area.&nbsp; He widened his line and crossed under the Washington Bridge on abandoned railway rails Providence 
and Worcesters.&nbsp; Sirens were heard in the distance.</p>

<p>The group got caught finally on, and northeast continued by the boat area and along the abandoned and active rails 
of the railway Providence and Worcesters.&nbsp; Applicable trace out led to Point of Crook and the south side of 
the abandoned opened railway bridge Providence and Worcesters.&nbsp; Before the north side of this bridge nearly 
<b>Ben</b> had killed to unite years.&nbsp; Both remained he and its master away.&nbsp; Unfortunately.&nbsp; 
<b>Dry foot</b>, <b>WHO</b> and <b>Oozing</b> of followed <b>Fuwangi</b> around swampy the sump of this point and 
again brought together <b>Basket</b> and the other one at an examination under the bridge Henderson.&nbsp; 
<b>Async</b> stood on the bridge, after much esgehabt the time, to make sure had esgehabt that the hares had not 
crossed in Providence, since most had assumed.&nbsp; Sirens were audible in Providence.&nbsp; The trace found and 
northeast continued.</p>

<p>Another examination was found.&nbsp; There were two apart-current railway rails to Providence and Worcesters.
&nbsp; There was a way down to the river.&nbsp; There was a way up to a road.&nbsp; Decreased/went back in disorder 
to the disorder.&nbsp; Finally led by <b>Basket</b>, they found to Hinterueberschrift somewhat east on Plasterung.
&nbsp; They crossed an industrial lot and came to a fence and to some gates.&nbsp; They were locked.&nbsp; &quot;
Hmmn!&quot;,&nbsp; the hare said.&nbsp; &quot;these were not locked before!&quot;,&nbsp; Sirens could be heard 
in Pawtucket.&nbsp; Most hashers, led by <b>Async</b>, had risked the life and Testikel, which climb more rueber, 
than <b>Fuwangi</b> discovered an opening.&nbsp; He went through and laughed at the <b>Basket</b>, which 
around-erred in the dirt with its main half by the distance in the gate.&nbsp; But all were soon free and back on 
trace.</p>

<p>The trace led on a paved road behind the gas memory service.&nbsp; Some tanker process card which pulled inside 
and led hashers.&nbsp; More sirens heard and now came of Six the Corner area.&nbsp; An examination led the north, 
into a darker and foreboding range.&nbsp; <b>WHO</b> found the line and followed trace for the end of the road, where 
she to the right made a grass-like range, and another gate.&nbsp; Markings deleted beyond led, <b>WHO</b> thus with a 
sigh to receive led it <b>Dry Foot</b> and <b>Fuwangi</b> over the fence and did not wait to help in order to see, 
if the hares would remain, in order to the dogs their owners over here.&nbsp; Trace led to a pair of radio essays 
(the place of assembly radio station of the Island Rhode first, WEAN, there left) and UP a dam to:&nbsp; the 
railway Providence and Worcesters.</p>

<p>Back on the rail (very merry, as?)&nbsp; they crossed the 10-mile river on Providence and 
Worcestereisenbahnriegeln alone, apart closed far enough it would cross in order to guarantee the imprudent knoechel 
to obligations, and that no dog (or cow, because that affair) to try.&nbsp; [ Finally!&nbsp; A solution to the 
<b>Basket</b> and <b>Bondo</b> problem.&nbsp; Kudos to the hares!&nbsp; <b>Bondo</b> really gave above before the 
second fence.&nbsp; But i-digress. ] The remaining group, which was continued northeast over road Roger Williams, 
and burned through behind the markings, which precede down away from the railway rails Providence and Worcesters.&nbsp; 
But they regrouped soon.&nbsp; <b>Oozing</b> had gotten caught place of assembly of the flour on the road down with the crossing of the bridge.&nbsp; He designated it back and led soon with <b>Async</b>, behind the land association Agawam, 
to an examination on the corner of the road Broadway and the road Roger Williams.</p>

<p><b>Async</b> and <b>WHO</b> were convinced that this must terminate marathon.&nbsp; Thus they precede southwest 
on Broadway toward to the avenue Massasoit and to the fastest way back.&nbsp; <b>Ooze</b> straight continued at 
averaging race.&nbsp; But it did not have a conviction and gave soon above.&nbsp; <b>Fuwangi</b>, disoriented 
completely from Cumberland, the turned north on the road Newman out and trusted to the fact that the road went 
upward.&nbsp; It also preceded toward to the tones of the sirens on avenue Pawtucket.&nbsp; <b>Dry Fussfee</b> 
hung back with the hares and waited, in order to see, if basket would form it over the river.&nbsp; Finally relented 
the hares and showed them to the east to averaging race.</p>

<p>The trace, which was led to the east, over 114 to shift and crossed then and to the left the Plasterung again at 
a familiar playing field.&nbsp; They umsaeumten the field and registered the wood on ways along the banks of the 
10-mile river again.&nbsp; Finally a &quot;B&quot; was anvisiert.&nbsp; <b>Fuwangi</b> was first to the beer, and a 
quiet prayer of the thanks was offered, when it failed that the hares had packed only eight beers.&nbsp; There were 
six at the beer examination.&nbsp; But <b>Basket</b> and <b>Bondo</b> did not stand a probability.&nbsp; Distant 
sirens were heard on way 44.&nbsp; Beer was calmly enjoyed, while hashers it waited that the hares transport produce 
back to the cars.&nbsp; After four miles of running, there had to be a travel straight back.&nbsp; Regard the hare.
&nbsp; He does not have any more than four miles in one week, let alone twice on one day run calmly.&nbsp; Hope 
turned at frights, when the hare mentioned that he had stopped trace on his bicycle!</p>

<p>Sadly then, they stated 44 back to way.&nbsp; The leaders <b>Async</b> and <b>Fuwangi</b> soon were lost, dragged 
in the distance by the <b>Oozing thing</b> (broken wave) and <b>Dry Fussfee</b> auto+less (overthrough leader, ran to 
the beginning of his house on the eastern side).&nbsp; <b>WHO</b> had other ideas and clung with the hare, 
emptying helpfully empties suggests in a living preparation sorting drawer by the side of the road.&nbsp; He knew 
that the car of the hare had not been parked with the beginning and hoped, in order to avoid something from the agony 
of the return journey.&nbsp; Applicable enough, had parked the hare at the Red Brueckentavern.&nbsp; Unfortunately 
the dragging gewankeren without cars had decided to precede for the same point.&nbsp; Like that it was, a pushed 
and against the rules-smelling car, which pulled up at the parking lot after some minutes.</p>

<p><b>Basket</b> and <b>Bondo</b> pulled up soon thereafter after triumph-drive out to the search to the group 
triumph-drive were.&nbsp; <b>Fuwangi</b> and <b>Async</b> limped finally inside.&nbsp; The circle was shifted into 
the wood.&nbsp; The evaluations for the run were given.&nbsp; Plasterung, Plasterung, Plasterung, Plasterung, railway 
rails Providence and Worcesters and lack of stopping with all those sirens would have usually spelled fate.&nbsp; 
But loss of <b>Bondo</b>, of <b>Ben</b> and of <b>Basket</b> on trace had to outweigh this.&nbsp; Total quantity:
&nbsp; +6,9!&nbsp; Hashit:&nbsp; <b>Ooze</b>.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; The circle was terminated and it drove to the 
smokeless one Red Brueckentavern for another pleasing, if expensive end to another disorder off.</p>
