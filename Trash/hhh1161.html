style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hare set another trail from the John Curran Reservoir in 
West Cranston. The group gathered with promises of visiting bimbos; naturally, 
none showed up. Apparently, they have been reading the trash describing <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> trails, and showed good judgement. They wouldn't have 
fitted in with good judgement anyways. So it was the usual all-male group that 
started off, promptly at six-thirty. Trail started off east along the reservoir 
dam.<BR><BR>The first check was halfway along the berm. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> continued straight, but <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> found true trail heading south on paths with some light 
bushwhacking. A check at the powerlines confused <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
enough that the more athletic and more youthful were able to take the lead as 
trail turned east to the north shore of the lower reservoir. The hare had warned 
of trespassing, Great Danes and angry property owners, so <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing&nbsp;</FONT>and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>LFE</FONT> made sure to stay out in front, away from <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> with their 
canines. <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> was constrained by his dog who could 
not see ANY resemblance of the briar-laden underbrush with Lincoln Park 
racetrack. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>was trying out his own theories, as 
usual. <FONT color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT> was missing.<BR><BR>The lead pack came 
east and trail doubled back on itself just at the edge of a backyard. There was 
in fact, a large and some might say ill-tempered Great Dane that stayed on the 
edge of the yard snarling. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> tried to find trail, but even the hare lost his own 
marks at this point. It was tempting to wait for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Murphy</FONT> to arrive, 
especially as the homeowner had come out with all the noise. But the hare 
directed <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>LFE </FONT>to 
make their way out to Laten Knight Road and turn right. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT> took to the woods, following the <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> school of thought, if one might exaggerate a bit. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> finally arrived and had a nice chat, 
doubtless&nbsp;sharing some tips about ear-tip management&nbsp;for Great Danes, 
with the irate dog-owner. <FONT color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT> was 
missing.<BR><BR>The lead group found trail across the road, continuing east, and 
turning north. A dried retention pond was crossed, and then bushwhacking 
resumed. Somehow, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was in the lead again, but he 
came to another powerline. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> is confused by 
powerlines. <FONT color=#ff0000>LFE</FONT>&nbsp;took the lead&nbsp;as the trail 
turned west and came along a horse enclosure. This was a lovely, broad 
field&nbsp;with, as <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> soon found out to his 
chagrin, an electric fence. Very soon thereafter <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Heath</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> made the same 
discovery. There was much noise and commotion. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> 
heard the sounds and managed to short-cut his way to the field. He was&nbsp;just 
in time&nbsp;to have a nice chat, doubtless sharing some horse sheath-cleaning 
pearls-of-wisdom, with the irate stable-owner. <FONT color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT> 
was still missing.<BR><BR>Trail crossed back over Laten Knight Rd, west. After a 
short jog on trails, the leaders caught up with <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Async</FONT>.&nbsp;The wanker&nbsp;had backtracked from the upper 
pond and was waiting at the BC. But no beer was to be found. Finally, the hare 
straggled in, carrying the beer. It was decided to take the beer check to a more 
scenic spot on the rock overlooking the reservoir. The group found the spot, 
although <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> 
decided to give their dogs a swimming lesson closer to the&nbsp;dam at the south 
end of the pond. Beer was opened and a few songs were sung to the fishermen in 
canoes. It was a nice evening for a swim, so they did.&nbsp;<FONT 
color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT>&nbsp;was still missing.<BR><BR>Finishing up, they 
ran back to the cars. It was decided to search briefly for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT>, as the hash has become a bunch of pansy-assed 
fairies that can't leave a man to fend for himself. Interfering with 
the&nbsp;course of natural selection, I say! But <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
saw a distant figure limping up the road, a half-mile south.&nbsp;He drove off 
to give him a lift. (<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO </FONT>had a new song with 40 
verses, and was obviously willing to accept hashit if necessary.) All together 
finally, they circled up, in the water at the boat ramp.<BR><BR>Ratings for the 
run: minmal pavement, but light shiggy; loss of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Tinker</FONT>, but <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket </FONT>was found; 
excellent electric fence action, but no full-on electrocutions; and powerlines, 
powerlines, powerlines. Total: +0.69. <FONT color=#ff0000>LFE</FONT> was long 
overdue for a renaming. He was named <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> for 
reasons so secret that even the scribe doesn't know. But it somehow seems to 
fit. Hashit was the source of considerable discussion, but no one was willing to 
brave a new song from <FONT color=#ff0000>Dr WHO</FONT>, so it went to... <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, of course! Finishing up, they moved on to the 
Bishop Hill Tavern, where they don't mind us much as long as they can keep us in 
the back room. Which is, after all, just as it should be.<BR><BR></SPAN>
