<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Clear, 80’s.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy, Dr W.H.O., Fuwangi Boner, Amish It Head, Microhard.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The Independence Day hash started with great promise: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> and Ben were in N.H. (Only Seamus was missed.) The beginning was from the home of <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Stephanie</font>. She was setting up a very elaborate Fourth of July Party. With food and everything! And the hashers were 
invited! Then, as they gathered waiting for Co-Hare <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to live-set the beginning of 
trail, there was entertainment in the form of a loud crash followed by several minutes of drunken shrieking profanity. 
There was a car accident on Rt 117 a block away from the start. The hash watched as the drunken female passenger of a 
near-totalled sedan screamed at the drunken driver of a barely-scratched pickup truck. The confusion only increased when 
the highly suspicious-appearing Co-Hare set out to live-hare. He almost immediately tried to lay some white powder down 
right next to the police officers at the accident scene. What a start! But it was all downhill from there.</p>

<p>The group gave the Co-hare the requisite 15 minutes to avoid arrest, and then set out to a check mark at the accident 
site almost hidden by broken windshield glass. A single mark in each direction split the group. But <font color="#FF0000">
Dr WHO</font> had noted an arrow at the opposite end of Troy Ave. while parking. He was tired. He was lazy. So he turned 
back, and met the Hare sneaking to the shore on a path between houses. He called on-on. The rest, led by <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> followed. Trail followed the shoreline east.</p>

<p>They picked their way along the rocks, slippery and covered with seaweed in some areas. But nothing you could call 
shiggy. When a check was found, trail briefly turned back onto the streets. But <font color="#FF0000">Friar</font> decided 
that the shore was more pleasant and continued along. <font color="#FF0000">Mr Rogers</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> were marching to their own respective drummers, and were ranging in search of marks by the ballfields on 
Winter Ave, or over at Apponaug Cove. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> led and joined by <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> snared a frustrated Co-Hare, who began swearing mightily at the Hare. He attempted to deceive the two by leading 
back to the shore. But they persisted in the streets. And were soon able to lose trail completely. They decided to try the 
obvious and search Conimicut Point. They continued east without marks on Shawomet Ave.</p>

<p>At this point, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> encountered the Hare in her 
car. She slowed. She asked them if they would set a trail and a beer stop somewhere out on the point. She didn’t specify 
that they were to go to where the Co-Hare was waiting. She seemed at least slightly confused. But <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> grabbed the beer (experience tells) and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> grabbed the flour. They set their 
own trail out to the tip of the point, and set the beer stop ankle-deep in the ebbing tide, surrounded by Portuguese 
fishermen. They were joined by the Hare and her daughter. Meanwhile <font color="#FF0000">Friar</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> gamely continued to advance on the shore. They 
were visible from the beer stop. But they didn’t see the waving hashers, and with the wind, couldn’t hear the whistles. 
They assumed all the activity at the point was just another group of Portuguese fishermen. The Hare was dispatched to 
rescue them. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> became a swimming instructor for the Hare’s daughter. <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> maintained a firm grip on his beer. He practiced his Portuguese.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, tired of all this exercise, realized that the BC must be on the point. His keen 
sense of smell led him to the beer. (Or perhaps it was an adjacent group of cute 12 year old Portuguese fishing boys.) The 
hare, and <font color="#FF0000">Friar’s</font> group arrived. Now, only <font color="#FF0000">Mr Rogers</font> and the 
Co-Hare were missing. The group briefly worried about <font color="#FF0000">Mr Rogers</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Mr 
Rogers</font> arrived. Then they had another beer. Then, they ran out of beer. The Hare instructed them to run out to the 
park entrance. The Hare stayed to swim with her daughter. She discovered that it is in fact not wise to swim with your 
prescription eyeglasses perched in your hair.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> left early. He didn’t need no stinkin’ marks. He headed straight back to West 
Shore Road and the party. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed trail briefly down Elgin Street and into a Church 
garden. Trail disappeared. He came north to Point Ave. to meet <font color="#FF0000">Mr Rogers</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Friar</font>. They turned west. And met the Co-Hare. He was covered 
to the thighs with viscous, stinking, black mud. He did not look happy. Especially when the hashers had a good laugh 
seeing the trail of toilet paper marks he had just set along the salt marsh leading from the shore. Oops! They all had 
short-cutted! Ha, Ha!</p>

<p>Trail back was a boring meander through the neighborhoods back to Troy Ave. When all had arrived, they decided to 
circle in the water. They moved the beer down the path between houses and stood in the bay. This caused some concern to 
the adjoining property, where another Fourth-of-July party was beginning. When the singing started, the children were 
ushered into the house. The Hare had changed clothes and was reluctant to participate. She only went in up to her midfoot. 
The run was rated. The lack of shiggy, the excessive pavement, and the pleasant weather were outweighed by the Co-Hare’s 
vocal and whining annoyance, snaring of the live Co-Hare (not once, but twice!) the lack of Co-hare at the Beer Check, the 
near-arrest of the Co-Hare, the COMPLETE avoidance of the Co-Hare’s salt marsh, and the chance to ruin a few of the 
Co-Hare’s close friendships at the upcoming party. Add in the Hare’s lost glasses, and the new vocabulary words learned at 
the car accident at the start and, total: <b>+69</b>! The visitors were interrogated, the backsliding <font 
color="#FF0000">Microhard</font> was punished and the hashit was selected. Unanimous, of course. The Co-Hare! The 
mosquitoes were biting and they food was beckoning, so they swung low and moved back to <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Stephanie’s</font>.</p>

<p>The party was in full-swing, and the hashers dove in. Several attractive young ladies were accosted, and recruiting 
efforts went into high gear. <font color="#FF0000">Just Thalia</font> agreed to rejoin the Dragon Boat team. One fortunate 
young lady was even alouetted. <font color="#FF0000">Bungy</font> was sighted, and the circle almost reformed to punish 
her for her absence. But she has moved back to Tiverton, and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> knows where she lives. 
The singing started, only interrupted by the fireworks and bonfires on the shore. The food was plentiful and much finer 
than the usual hash fare. No one seemed to want any money for it either! (<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> didn’t pay?) 
All in all, it doesn’t get much better than this. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> wants to make this an annual event! 
(Sorry, <font color="#FF0000">Just Stephanie</font>!)</p>
