<p>Independence Day. A day for family and friends. A day of parades and fireworks, of hotdogs and ice cream. A day to 
celebrate the freedoms of our country for which so many have fought and died over the last 229 years. The right to Free 
Speech. The Right to Bear Arms. The Right to own Private Property. The hash has had some memorable excursions for 
Independence Day in the past. This day was not to be one of them.</p>

<p>Typically for the hare, ambiguous directions led to the gathering of the hashers at a point distant from the hare’s 
intended start. (Perhaps he thinks a mile is 5/8ths of a kilometer.) At any rate, he eventually sent SESYB back along 
138 to the group who were gathered across the street from Grassy Pond, and brought them to the start, almost a mile 
northeast, on what appeared to be some Private Property at the confluence of several driveways on the left side of the 
road. It was time almost immediately, and without <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>to slow everyone while he got 
changed, they were off at 6:30.</p>

<p>Trail started across the road, with a brief and childish attempt at sending hashers into Private Property. But it 
soon turned northwest on the Tippecansett Trail, a well marked and smoothly graded path.  <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi, 
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> traded the lead as they continued past several checks with falsies 
leading to more “Private Property” signs. The trail was packed and dusty.  <font color="#FF0000">Tinker </font>and <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> held back to be together. <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> and Seamus held back to be 
together.</p>

<p>Finally, a check turned east. A “Private Property” sign was ignored as trail led on, trampling on the rights of the 
property owner.  But it was not long before they came out on the Dye Hill Trail and the hashers were back on public land. 
Phew! Trail turned southeast, and widened into a formal dirt road. “Private Property” signs were seen in the shiggy on 
both sides of the road. But no more violations were to occur. And no shiggy was to be encountered. After about a mile of 
most unexceptional terrain, the trail turned back southwest on Grassy Pond Road (also dirt) to 138. <font color="#FF0000">
Snotty</font> used this opportunity to begin his training for a running r*ce he had entered, and began to sprint. This 
led to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> goading <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> to challenge, and there was more 
running than hashing going on shortly. What un-hashmanlike behavior! Shame, Shame! Running on trail! Hashit!</p>

<p>By now, everyone realized: a) the trail would be exceptionally dull, b) there would be no shiggy, c) no one was about 
to get lost, d) “Private Property” has deep, almost sacred meaning in Pakistan, and e) the hare was a wank! But one hope 
lay ahead, keeping them going, with dry, tortured feet and flagging spirits. Beer! And so they crossed 138 and ran the 
hot asphalt, yearningly glancing at the cool waters of Grassy Pond to their left. But that was Private Property, so they 
continued past the pond.</p>

<p>A left turn (west) led back into the woods. Here at least, some deer flies came out to keep them company. But again, 
to stray off trail would have violated the Camp Yawgoog “Private Property” signs. So on they went turning more north 
until they came upon the BC, an undistinguished segment of the undistinguished trail, marked only by the junction point 
with the Tippecansett trail. Natural features included a three inch rock disturbing the otherwise smooth packed-dirt 
surface of the path. Small perhaps, but it was enough to sprain <font color="#FF0000">Snotty’s</font> ankle. &nbsp;So 
God punishes those who would hash AND r*ce!</p>

<p>Beer was broached, only <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> missing. But even 
they finally arrived with some story of scouting trail to the south and west while waiting for the others to arrive. 
Sure, a brief trip to Dinosaur Rock. They didn’t even cross some Private Property. Right! But all had a beer or two, 
swatting flies and hoping that there would be some real trail ahead. It was not to be.</p>

<p>On In was northwest on the Tippecansett Trail, through some woods, past some houses and to the cars. The parking area 
was not Private Property at all! <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried to encourage a circle on some property that was 
clearly private in a field next to the cars, but it was decided to circle on public right-of-way in the trail partly 
hidden from the road and the houses. So the cooler was brought out and the circle joined.</p>

<p>Ratings for the run were horrendous, and for obvious reasons. A dry run, competition on trail, no shiggy, no one lost, 
good weather, too much pavement and road, etc., etc. But, the hare was a last minute stand-in.  <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> didn’t show up. There were some flies. Total: -0.69. Hashit obviously belonged to <font color="#FF0000">
Snotty</font>, but the voting took a shift based upon incessant whining, and it went to<font color="#FF0000"> 
Basket</font>. Finally, the circle ended, and they packed up and headed for exit 6 (not 6A) and Marks where the Property 
is always Public (or at least the malt vinegar is), hashers are welcomed and singing is encouraged.</p>
