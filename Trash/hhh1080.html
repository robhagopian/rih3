<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Providence, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 50’s, Clear</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The English language is pretty weird.  Take the word “boob.”  In case you’re not familiar, I’ll provide you with two 
definitions:</p>

<p>boob<sup>1</sup><br>
<i>–noun Slang: Sometimes Vulgar.</i><br>
1. a female breast.</p>

<p>boob<sup>2</sup><br>
<i>–noun</i><br>
1. a stupid person; fool; dunce.<br>
2. British. a blunder; mistake.<br>
<i>–verb (used without object)</i><br>
3. British. to blunder.</p>

<p>I’m sure that definition #1 was the first thing that popped into your head when thinking back to this run, but <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> woulda guessed that definition #2 would have been just as applicable?!  It was <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> birthday.  And <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> is a boob (But <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> isn’t in the RIH3?  Actually, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> is.).  Anyway, this is pretty weird, wild stuff.</p>

<p>I didn’t intend this write up to start with some reflections on the English language, but I couldn’t not think about 
boob definition #1 and just had to go with it.  What I did intend, I think, was to share some history on the progression 
of man.  This is only because I have no clue how old <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> is but assume it’s pretty damn 
old.  Unfortunately, I’m just an engineer and we didn’t get much more than numbers in college.  So, I go to my trusty 
source for all info, the internet (thanks Al Gore!), and did a little learnin’ up.  I found the following as a rough order 
of evolution of man.  If you don’t believe in evolution, skip over this section or you’ll be struck down and damned to 
hell by your God!</p>

<p>Reading more on each species I think I have <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> identified based upon features and 
mannerisms (wankerisms?), here’s a recap of what I decided was the best, the Homo habilis:</p>

<p>Homo habilis was called the handy man because tools (hash horns, shiggy shoes?) were found with his fossil remains. 
This species existed between 2.4 and 1.5 million years ago. The brain size in earlier fossil specimens was about 500cc but 
rose to 800cc toward the end of the species life period (I’d say <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> is more the former 
than latter). The species brain shape shows evidence that some speech had developed (note they say some). Habilis was 
about 5' tall and weighed about 100 pounds. Some scientists believe that habilis is not a separate species and should be 
carried either as a later Australopithecine or an early Homo erectus (haha, homo erectus). It is possible that early 
examples are in one species group and later examples in the other.</p>

<p>Eh, sounds good enough for me.  So, my guess of “pretty damn old” was right!  2.2 to 1.6 million years old to be 
exact.  This is going on my own personal observations; but I guess we could just ask <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
since he would have been around during that time as well.</p>

<p>Ok, ok, enough science.  I’m sure your brain hurts.  This run started from the Providence Stop and Shop.  You know, the 
one near the ghetto and the one that <font color="#FF0000">Dryfoot</font> has set trails from before.  Seemed pretty 
uneventful at first.  Once everyone had pre-lubed a bit the first mark was determined to be set on West River St heading 
south.  Trail continued on West River St until it veered north on Charles St.  No check, just continued marks.  For some 
reason this seemed odd to no one, but about 2.5 miles down the road they’d slap themselves for it.</p>

<p>The turn onto Charles St had the pack run past the Cadillac Lounge, Home Depot and then through the ethnic 
neighborhoods of North Providence.  Actually pretty scenic, and since it wasn’t that cold and there was absolutely zero 
shiggy the sights could really be taken in.  Including arrows.  One.  Five.  Twenty-two.  The pack traveled on, with all 
but <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and the hare in sight.  This again seemed odd to no one (actually, it seemed pretty 
damn good).</p>

<p>With no checks, no hills, no shiggy, no Ben and no more <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> the pace was quick.  
<font color="#FF0000">Virgin Just Nate</font> is an actual runner, and he and <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> 
were in the lead.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> weren’t far behind and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> rounded up the rear.  Haha, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> rounding up the rear.</p>

<p>Once the pack ended up at Mineral Spring Ave a “CB 69” was seen on the telephone pole.  Damn!  Not wanting the slower 
people to miss out on the last few hundred feet of “fun” <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> called on-on.  After everyone 
showed up a unanimous decision was made to go to the closest bar we could find, which happened to be about 0.25 miles down 
the road.  The only problem was, the bar was closed!  Another unanimous decision was made, and it was to find the nearest 
Packy (no, not <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>) so we could pick up a six pack.  About a mile back one showed up and 
after the birthday boy was nice enough to grab some refreshments an impromptu beer check was held in the parking lot in 
the rear.  It was glorious, but not near as glorious was what to come.</p>

<p>Once the beers were finished the pack hit the road back.  Knowing that the beer check HAD to be at the Cadillac Lounge 
the pace was quick.  Remember from above, boobs!?  Upon arrival a BC was spotted and somehow all managed to get in without 
confrontation despite their disheveled looks and foul smell (this was mainly <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>).</p>

<p>The place was nice, I have to give it that much.  Of course our eyes didn’t quite veer from the main stage, but is that 
really a surprise?  <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had a table setup, and 
our arrival caused a fury of excitement in the girls.  Ha!  Not.  What it did do though was bring them over so beers could 
be served.  And singles, five glorious singles provided by the hare for “entertainment.”  With the blink of an eye <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was up near the stage with <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Justin</font> making up the rest of the three stoogies.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> managed to 
arrive, and after removing exactly 17 layers of clothes was also ready to step up to plate.  Songs?  What songs.  Boobs 
were around!  Whoo, boobs!  But not only was there visual excitement, but that “nudie bar” smell was hanging heavy, and 
comments like “he’s all sweaty,” “you’d better take off your glasses or they might get broken,” and “hey you dirty 
bastard, get your hands out of your pants” rang through the air.  I think most will remember the tattoos.  I saw a 
butterfly.  I believe <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> saw a delicate flower.  It was awful hard to tell if the carpet 
matched the drapes due to all the hardwood floors.  Ahhhh, hardwood floors.  Not many will remember the names, but here 
they are anyway - Cinnamon, Christina, and Rachel.  Christina said she’d really like to show up, and like the gullible 
wanks we are we got all excited and believed it would happen.  Really, when was the last time a woman showed up to the 
RIH3 (<font color="#FF0000">Candy Kaner</font> – come back!)?</p>

<p>And just like any average RIH3’er/woman interaction, it seemed like things were over in 30 seconds.  I mean 30 minutes, 
yeah minutes.  With the singles gone, the beers dry and the hare dirt poor it was time to head out.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had brought the shaggin’ wagon so all (but <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> – silly, silly 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>) hopped in and enjoyed <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew on the way back.  Well, 
pretty much all but <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> but what can you expect being the temporary DD?  <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was wrapping up his last strides as the group pulled into the lot and the circle was held 
right there at Stop and Shop.  Comments included “this run caused a tingly feeling where my bathing suit covers,” “run of 
the year,” “smell my sweatshirt, it smells like stripper – really!”  Some more beers were downed, the virgin was 
questioned and it ends up that yep, this was just about run of the year.  <b>+69^69!</b> Hashit went to <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> because of his inability to prevent his urine from entering the same place as the other 
RIH3’ers shoes.</p>

<p>A trip to the newly rennovated East Avenue café had the group surrounded by football watchers.  Beers were consumed, 
wings bummed off of neighbors for sampling, just a weee bit of food throwing (and subsequent disciplining by the wait 
staff) and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> hassling the poor 95.5 WBRU kids was the normal going-ons.  Congrats <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, one more year above ground you crazy Homo habilis!</p>
