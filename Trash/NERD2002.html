<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The 2002 New England Red Dress Run was held in Providence, Rhode Island on September 29, 2002. The location selected 
was especially appropriate: the Roger Williams National Park, the “Birthplace of Religious Freedom” in the United States. 
It is of course, but a small jump from “Religious Freedom” to “Freedom to Cross-Dress and Act Like an Wanker in Public”. 
It is a historical fact that in 1672, Roger Williams himself preached from the pulpit of the First Baptist Church of 
America: &quot;No man who hath sinned can deny that our Lord hath RedDressed the sins of all men.&quot; And this park is 
in the city of Providence, the only major capital in New England likely to elect an openly gay mayor in the near future. 
Thus, a large group of visitors congregated at the park at 2 PM, bursting to see what the elderly but incompetent Rhode 
Islanders could come up with to celebrate the event.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/Start.jpg" width="329" height="249"></p>

<p>The hare and his advisors, knowing the tendencies of most hashers to start everything late (and drunk), arrived more 
leisurely between 2:15 and 2:30. What a group! Several car accidents were narrowly averted (a theme that would be repeated 
throughout the day) as people craned their necks to get a look.  Particularly striking was the hare in a pink wig framing 
his face and a silky-red minidress. At about 2:40, <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>, attired in a form-fitting 
“Tango” sheath with torn spaghetti straps, called a circle to order for calisthenics to help sober up some of the visitors 
before their upcoming ordeal.&nbsp; After introductions, “Father Abraham” was performed vehemently. Up the street a short 
distance and all of a sudden, the Episcopal Bishop was seen to eagerly run out of the Cathedral of S. John, only to turn 
back, embarrassed at not having her red vestments or crimson miter handy.  Turning back to the crowd, the hare gave 
instructions (that were, as always, ignored). He promised a brief but full tour of the fair city of Providence. And 
the hounds were off.</p>

<p>Crossing the park they looks for marks and for a while, all that could be heard were plaintive cries of 'R.U.?&quot; 
But soon, trail was found leading up Smith Hill past the State Capitol. They ran uphill, led by the younger and more 
transgendered (who were looking for a chance to break from the crowd and find some action). Atop the hill, trail turned 
south on Francis Street to a check.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/SmithSt1.jpg" width="391" height="294"></p>

<p>Most went straight. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>was clad in a form-fitting (i.e. unflattering) red sheath with 
lace straps, wearing a blonde wig with kerchief. He realized that the road led directly in front of the Rhode Island 
Medical Society. In his current outfit he felt he might risk his career and reputation, not to mention censure from the 
internists, laughter from the surgeons, and inappropriate propositions from the urologists. He therefore turned left onto 
the State house lawn. He stumbled upon true trail. This led through an impromptu soccer game being played by some rather 
humorless Cape Verdeans. He ran straight toward a large group only to hear one of them say: &quot;Let's keel thees 
sonomabeetch!&quot; Luckily, his &quot;On ON!' and whistles drew the rest of the runners.  Few Cape Verdeans feel capable 
of tackling a herd of 40 transvestites with handbags so they withdrew, muttering Portuguese imprecations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The pack crossed in front of the State House safely,</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/Capitol.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">and briefly lost trail on Gaspee Street.</p>

<p>Finally <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font>, wearing a simple but classic red evening dress, with tastefully 
applied lipstick and mascara found a chalk mark leading into Union Station. He entered followed by most. The security 
guards mobilized preparing to arrest this group of obvious terrorists. But when one of the hashers came up to them and 
introduced himself as former Vice-President Al Gore, they were reassured and allowed the group to proceed.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/AlGore1.jpg" width="300" height="400"></p>

<p>The group unaccountably ignored the numerous chalked arrows on the station floor that indicated frantically that true 
trail involved boarding the next train for Back Bay. They proceeded through the station and followed the true trail down 
to the Moshassuck river and around to Waterplace Park.</p>

<p>On both sides of Waterplace, the hashers ran in groups, disrupting the tourists and milling about confusedly at every 
check mark. Some went straight. Some went left across the river. Some stopped to ask directions at the defunct Tourist 
Information booth. Finally they gathered at the top of the stairs leading to Providence Place Mall.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/WaterPlace.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Wintoes 69</font>, in a daring but pert red backless number, ran straight into the mall followed 
by a small group. [This had the happy result of provoking a sudden price war between Filenes and Nordstrom's who saw an 
opportunity of riding their inventory of tasteless red costume jewelry. But I digress.] The rest found trail in the tunnel 
under the mall leading to Promenade Street at the Foundry.</p>

<p>West they ran along the banks of the Woonasquatucket. On the south bank they heard a distant bugle call, and realized 
that once again <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> had managed to get out of the fix he had gotten himself into 
with his latest shortcut. Half-blind, half-mind, we never can seem to get rid of him. And those annoying Bugle calls! Back 
to the story: at Pleasant Valley Parkway, a check led left up into Federal Hill and onto Atwells Avenue. Most made it up 
uneventfully</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/PleasantPkwy1_s.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>

<p>but some insisted on turning east towards the Convention Center, seeing a blur of red in the distance (the Shriners 
convention may never be the same.).</p>

<p>The true trail led west on Atwells Ave. This street is the heart of Federal Hill, the 'Little Italy' of Providence. The 
idea of running this street in drag would make most Rhode Islanders think twice. But the local memories of Federal Hill's 
most famous son, Raymond &quot;Red Dress&quot; Patriarca, served to protect the runners in general (apart, of course, from 
the ever-present sexual harassment. Your scribe was told that both <font color="#FF0000">Deposits in the Rear</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Cums in the Rear</font> were severely and serially pinched in the Rear by a group of myopic Italian 
barbers, but this could be wrong. It was also said that they loved it. But I digress.). Passing the restaurants and shops, 
a parade of sorts formed. It was led by a car following the runners pace (it is amazing that manual transmissions can go 
that slow without stalling) honking loudly to add to the already impressive din. Turning regretfully south on a side 
street, a BN was finally encountered. Trail crossed over Broadway and Westminster to a house on a formerly quiet street 
near the Armory.</p>

<p>This was the house of <font color="#FF0000">Just Alex</font>, an infrequent and new RI hasher who had gamely agreed to 
host the first beer check. He even wore a simple dress with white pearls. Adding his brilliant red lipstick, there was a 
certain &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; quality to the effect that was most interesting. The beer was found in a 
chilled garbage can, but yet again, the appropriate valves to pressurize and tap the keg were missing. [<font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> has always had trouble with prongs and male adapters, among other things.] But the quick 
thinking and resourceful FRB's managed to hoist the keg upended into a tree where gravity allowed it to flow freely 
(&quot;I'll have two-tree beers!&quot; quipped the hare, annoyingly.)</p>

<p><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/BeerCheck1.jpg" width="386" height="291"></p>

<p>Amazingly, all the hashers gradually straggled into the BC. (Although a few were slightly late as they had come upon a 
gay bar in Olneyville that had a Special, providing drinks on the house for &quot;Most Tasteful Ensemble Sunday&quot;.) 
Conversations flowed, fashion tips were traded and beer was sipped in the lovely breezes and in the shade. A group decided 
that songs were in order and, led by 'I Left My Heterosexuality in San Francisco' (Al Gore), <font color="#FF0000">Enos
</font> (Al Bundy), <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (Al Anon) and the Hare (Al Qaeda), the peace of the afternoon was 
disrupted. A prolonged version of the Limerick Song droned on, resurrecting limericks that have not been heard since WW II 
(for good reason). The Hairs of Her Dickie Di Do were again discussed. My Rhubarb again refused to rise. But before the 
police could arrive, the beer ran out, so it was on on to the next phase.</p>

<p>Trail led back north to Westminster, then east. The runners were somewhat the worse for wear from the beers after the 
initial run. They jogged slowly until, while crossing into the Vocational High School area, they encountered some twelve-
year olds on skateboards. The leader of this group, a somewhat husky lad whose voice had not yet changed, called out: 
&quot;Look at these f*cking homos. Youse are all a bunch of f*ckin' faggots. We should f*cking kick yer ass!&quot; This 
stimulus invigorated the hashers who spontaneously joined hands and began to skip gaily for the lads.</p>

<p>More confusion developed around the Central/Classical High School quadrangles, but ultimately Broad Street (renamed 
&quot;Red Broad Street&quot; for the occasion) was taken across Route 95. Trail was followed through the courtyard of the 
Cathedral of SS Peter and Paul, where a wedding was taking place. The Men of Honor wanted their photographs taken with 
the colorful hashers, but the bride wept, realizing that her bridesmaids outfits looked drab and dull next to the vision 
in evening gloves that was <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>, or next to the startling yet elegant white-wigged <font 
color="#FF0000">KNO,</font> or even the Harriette-Whose-Name-Your-Scribe-Does-Not-Know in the accompanying picture.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/Wedding.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>

<p>(When <font color="#FF0000">Evil Bitch RIPTA</font> arrived, wearing a elaborate maroon brocade ball gown with creamy 
bodice and frilly underthings, the poor bride grabbed the keys to the Rolls and drove off to call her psychiatrist, who 
unaccountably could not be reached as he was hosting some kind of an athletic event. But I digress.)The hashers regrouped 
on Weybosset Street at the 'Round Top' Church and headed past the bemused limo drivers at the Providence Performing Arts 
Center. A sold-out special performance of &quot;An Evening with Dame Edna&quot; was in progress. The quick-witted manager, 
seeing the reaction of the people in the street to the runners, made an immediate call to his booking agency to see if the 
&quot;Blue Man Group&quot; would consider a change in color. Meanwhile the trail led through the commons of Johnson and 
Wales University. The students, assuming it was another Rhode Island School of Design event, didn't notice anything out of 
the ordinary. Thence to the old Garrity Courthouse, and back up under Route 195 to Richmond Street. A strange figure was 
ahead for much of the trail, a red dressed individual with a long pink pole and a blonde pageboy wig. It was <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS.</font> When <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> is FRB, you know the trail must suck. But he knows 
this area. He has driven here often, usually after hashes where Barleywine has been served and he takes the wrong exit off 
route 6 trying to get home without crashing.</p>

<p>It was now obvious to the natives, that the destination was the Point Street Bridge. The RIH3-ers led the way, and sure 
enough, crossing the bridge, one could see on the opposite riverbank two red figures. Even at this distance, it was obvious 
that they had had too much to drink. It turned out that it was none other than <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi </font>and 
<font color="#FF0000">Cream Whora.</font> Both crippled (one by injury, one by poor choices in a dissolute childhood), they 
had been expecting arrivals for over an hour. With nothing to do but to try to make conversation with the nearby Cambodian 
Eel-Mongers, they surreptitiously broached the beer that was their sacred trust. As everyone arrived, the beer supply was 
already dangerously low. The scenes from the previous beer check were duplicated. The Cambodians packed up their eels and 
left in a huff.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/BeerCheck2.jpg" width="401" height="302"></p>

<p>Once it was clear that there was no more beer to be had until the on on on, the group began to leave, following the 
short trail back along South Main and Benefit Streets, half-way up College Hill to the Hares place on Benefit Street. They 
gathered in the parking lot and had more beer. Bondo fired up the grill, Dr WHO fired up his chili upstairs and as the 
cooking progressed, the circle was joined. Basket Boom Boom acted as RA. [ Whine#1: Your scribe was in and out of the 
circle because of tending his chili for the benefit of the unworthy runners but he will do the best he can. You can 
probably get more details from Cums Alone's writeup for Boston, if you want. But why on earth would you want more 
details?]</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/Circle11.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>

<p>The ratings of the run reflected mostly a sense of relief that the torture was over. Many complained that it was too 
short. Your scribe would estimate it as well over the unofficial limit of 6.9 miles [Whine#2], so this criticism cannot 
be gainsaid. The weather was inappropriate. No one of significance was lost for any length of time. But soon it was pointed 
out that the run was ENTIRELY POPULATED BY BIMBOS! Hooray! Total: 6.9! Next: visitors in the circle. This as is usually 
the case in Rhode Island, resulted in mass confusion. So read the other write-ups from Boston or Newport or wherever, and 
we'll skip that part. We move on to awards. Awards for Best-Dressed, Worst-Dressed and anything else the progressively 
confused <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> could come up with were given. For Worst-Dressed,<font color="#FF0000"> 
Enos</font> from Australia was given a new white tutu to keep his conkers down under. Best-dressed went to <font 
color="#FF0000">EverReady the Beaver</font>. [Whine#3: This represents blatant favoritism on the part of the audience, 
under the influence of Bondo-brew. How else could they not see the charming simplicity yet stunning audacity of Dr WHO's 
outfit? But I digress.] Commemorative CD's containing original Hash songs were distributed as well as special NERD t-
shirts.</p>

<p>Many crimes were discussed as the evening wore on, and the Bostonians seemed to mutiny and take over the proceedings. 
Unnecessary body parts were exposed. Wearers of new shoes were chastised. They attempted to name <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Carole</font> on her fifth (run, not whiskey), and could only come up with &quot;Swallows My Pride&quot;.  This is 
obviously unsuitable for a Rhode Island Name as it is mildly witty, and is a sentence fragment. Why is it that Boston 
feels the need to name everyone in sentences, usually incomplete, rather than the more typical adjective-noun pairings? 
[Whine#4.]</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/NERD02/Circle22_s.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>

<p>With darkness upon the group, they swung low and moved onto dinner; more beer, thievery (of <font color="#FF0000">
Basket's</font> horn) [Eds. Note: THANK you all, so much!], nudity, and grammatical faux pas abounding. We of the RIH3 
thank all that came, especially those select few who actually paid their $10 [Whine #5], and hope that the nasty diarrhea 
from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's </font>beer didn't keep you up all night.</p>

<p>On On</p>
