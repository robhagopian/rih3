color=#000000>It looked like it was going to be another one of those nights: all 
sausage, no breast meat. But thankfully <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic Housing</FONT> 
arrived just in time to break the curse of RIH3 gayness. And no <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> served as an added bonus. Starting from the parking 
lot of Papagino’s next to the Powder Mill Ledges Wildlife Refuge, the hash 
almost immediately entered the woods and headed south. They came to the Boy 
Scout trails. They split into two groups; one found true trail heading 
southeast, the other bushwhacked over to the powerlines.<?xml:namespace prefix =

color=#000000>The group rejoined and headed south, encountering lovely thin 
break-through ice in pools along the powerlines. A check before the switching 
station had them going in all directions. Ultimately <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flexi</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>CEP</FONT> found that true 
trail reversed itself and followed the switching station path north back to, and 
across the road. As the group waited for a break in the traffic, they were 
amused to see <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Cosmo</FONT> threading their way through cars further up the road 
towards 295. Fortunately, the dog was not injured. Unfortunately, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> also was not injured.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Following true trail at this point was a big mistake. Anyone with 
more than half a brain would have realized that the beer would be on one of the 
scenic high points on the powerline. But anyone with more than half a brain 
would not be hashing anyways. The pack continued, and turned east. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> predicted that the beer would be found near the 
cemetery overlooking the Target store in Smithfield Crossings, so he encouraged 
the leaders. They came out to the spot, after a short bushwhack and found no 
marks. <o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

into the woods. By blind (especially in <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket’s</FONT> 
case) luck, they came to the out marks, and followed them back to the beer check 
and the hare. The rest had turned west to try and get back to the powerlines, 
and finally found a few marks. At last, they came out to the powerline path, and 
followed marks turning south to the beer. The beer was located, and the whining 
almost drowned out the singing (not for the first time, I might 
add).<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Trail back continued south on the powerline paths, crossed Rt. 44 
and turned back to the cars. The circle was held in the woods of the Wildlife 
Refuge. This violated basically every rule that the Audubon Society had listed 
near the entrance: Closed after dusk, No pets, No profane language, No smoking 
and No alcohol, to name a few. They should just simplify it and post “No 
Hash-like behavior.” Much simpler and more inclusive. The run was rated. Minimal 
pavement, no <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, some nice frozen-water shiggy, 
and at least one fine bimbo were the pertinent positives. But, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> short-cutting 
to the beer, no one killed crossing a main thoroughfare twice, and not one inch 
of virgin territory! Total: +0. There were no backsliders, so the virgin was 
initiated, and told a joke. Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey 
Punch</FONT>, for following <FONT

color=#000000>After finishing, the group moved on to Tickers (formerly 
Swampy’s), where virtually nothing has changed under the new management. They 
even still stocked pickled eggs, although the RIH3 was probably the last group 
to request these delicacies. A round of eggs for all, and there were four left. 
The waitress begged the group to finish them off, before the Health Department 
saw the expiration date on the jar (6/9/69, I believe). So of course <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> said he would eat the eggs if someone else would 
drink the juice. Some people can’t resist a challenge. <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Rich</FONT>, now a three-timer though he had the juice to do this, and promptly 
quaffed almost a quart of brine, while <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> 
weaseled out and ate only one egg. The food came, the beer flowed, and after 
settling up, they noticed they had lost <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Rich</FONT>. 
But he was easily found. It didn't need a Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp;A trail of five 
large and vinegary pools of vomit led right to his car, where he stood, looking 
innocent, if a bit green. It doesn’t get any better than that!</FONT></SPAN>
