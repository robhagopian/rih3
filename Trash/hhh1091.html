<p><font color="#008000">Run #1091, 1091A</font>, February 24, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket, Oozing, Trail Hoover</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Rumney, NH and Harmony, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Cold as a witches T*t and blowing like a cheap XXX flick.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; The Rumney Hash saw a number old timers and a few newbies join us this 
year: Cum Titty returned with Just Spike and her pup from Seacoast, BH3 had Ski Bobbit, Dribbles, Cums Alone, Hare Club, 
Holy Ozone, Beaten by a Girl, Friar, the Fat One, Sweet Molasses, Creamwhora, and  4 legged friends Zena, Mutton Chops, 
and Mr. Rogers, while RIH3 saw the Hares joined by Amish, Dog Meat, Bondo, Just Big Shit, Eenie Weenie, Dr. WHO, WIPOS, 
Fuwangii, Taste Like Chicken, Ben the Dog,  and Shameless.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>To tell the story of this unusual event, we’ll need to start on Friday night, where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>,
 <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Trail</font> were joined by <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fat One</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Sweet Molasses</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dog 
Meat</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Taste Like Chicken</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Holy Ozone</font> and others that kept warm by the fire, singing and drinking Trinity IPA and Single Malt Scotch to the 
wee morning hour. One by one they stole away until quite fell on the Rumney Hash House, save some thumping going on in the 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> room. I’m sure he was just trying to get off his frozen boots, but oh what dreams 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had. He tried to jump <font color="#FF0000">Dog Meat</font>, but she’d have nothing to 
do with it.</p>

<p>The hares struggled to gather their wits about them the next morning, as they started out to set trail. Realizing they 
got up later than planned, they would not be able to pre-lay the entire trail. It was decided to set trail to the beer 
stop and the return loop. The remaining trail would have to be set live from the start to the top of the mountain at 3 
Pond Shelter. The Hares made it back to the Hash House minutes after the scheduled noon start, but as late cumers were 
still arriving and the hot chocolate for the Shelter Stop need to be prepared, all enjoyed some ‘Hare of the Dog’ and 
loosened up for what promised to be a (dare I say it?) athletic event.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was DFL with his home brew and chili in hand, just as all were loading the vehicles 
to carpool to the start a few miles away. He was smiling now, but how long would that last? Instructions were given, and 
then <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Hoovah</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
started out marking trail. The pack sang a few warm-up ditties and gave the Hares a respectable 6.9 minute head start. The 
trail to the shelter and spiked hot chocolate was all but straight uphill, 400+v and about 3 miles. Tracks lay mostly on 
snowmobile cut paths, with the depth of the snow off route being mid thigh and heavy.</p>

<p>Carrying beer, hot chocolate, fire supplies and flour against a head wind going while uphill was enough to give old 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> some heavy breathing, and not just because he was following close behind <font 
color="#FF0000">Hoovah</font> in tights. The thought someone might overtake us became reality as <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> was snagged by the FRB’s, as he was asked to lay a falsie off in unbroken tracks and struggled in the 3ft 
snow. <font color="#FF0000">Hoovah</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> continued to the top where <font 
color="#FF0000">Hoovah</font> laid a circle jerk about the ponds for the overachievers, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> started the ‘fire’ and brought out the schnapps - hot chocolate in the shelter.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, lead a small pack of BH3er’s to the hut just moments after the hares, with all 
complaining about the bellowing head wind, no real beer, and the now-dead raging fire. Hot Chocolate was enjoyed straight 
or otherwise until the remaining hashers arrived. Surprisingly, all made it to the top, and with the high percentage of 
skiers vs. snowshoe’rs, the ride downhill would be fast and interesting, especially for the first time skiers.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Enie Weenie</font> was sailing along spectacularly until maxim velocity surpassed mental process 
speed, just as some snowmobiles were starting up a steep grade. They slowed upon seeing him, having already tossed <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> off their skis 
and into the woods moments before, but the sudden aberration still unnerved him off trail and into the snow bank, head 
first. The skiers continued weaving their way downhill, around snowmobile, walkers and fallen hashers until beer was found 
at the intersection with the Carr Mountain Trail.</p>

<p>The pack consumed 5 gallons of IPA to their credit and did so before the ranger found his way toward us. He did stop a 
few hasher to look after the <font color="#FF0000">Fat One</font>, who seemed to be a bit on the pale side. I guess his 
weight loss program is a tad behind schedule. The trail continued downhill, but on a lesser traveled path, that caused 
many to struggle in the deep snow. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> found that even a small uphill grade on skis can be 
frustrating and painful. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> ducked as he whizzed his ski pole off in the distance saying 
something about Aaaaaaahrhhhrrrr F@cking Skis! This would be the first indication that the Moon was in an unusual position 
with Jupiter and Mars, or maybe alcohol and snow don’t always mix so well.</p>

<p>All, except <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, made it back to the cars, so in typical Hash Spirit, we drove back to 
<font color="#FF0000">FO’s</font> for beer and warmth and left him to his own design. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
did go back to get him, which almost landed him the Hashit. When they returned, the circle and serious beer drinking 
commenced.</p>

<p>Two blocks of ice were supplied for the hares. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> sat cheek to cheek on one, and <font color="#FF0000">Hoovah</font> took the other. I know what your thinking, but 
I had my butt on one when <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> jumped in before <font color="#FF0000">Hoovah</font> had her 
chance. Complaints and comments were very slowly passed around the circle, as butt cheeks slowly melted into the ice. 
Others <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> enjoyed the ice were hosts: <font color="#FF0000">TFO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Cumtitty</font>, who was a stand-in for <font color="#FF0000">Sweet M</font>, along with <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> – Hashit, some First Timers, and a few others now lost to memory Down-downs were enjoyed by 
many and songs sung.. Then it was time to eat and sauna.</p>

<p>Food, as always, was great and wolfishly devoured, and then a small contingent made their way to the sauna. Regulars 
<font color="#FF0000">Ski Bobbit</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fat One</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and 
<font color="#FF0000">Mr Rogers</font>, were joined by returnees <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Cumtitty</font> along with virgins <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and others. Disappointingly most of the females had their whatever’s hidden, 
while the men were bumping heads, so to speak. It was pretty pathetic, as usual, but it didn’t stop the singing and IPA. 
It wasn’t long before the need for cool fresh air helped most to decide it was time for a dip in the freshly cut hole in 
the ice. One by one they crept along the ice and dipped. A few slipped and fell and some never to made it in. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> crashed first and would be taking home some new bruises he’d have to explain to Mrs about. 
<font color="#FF0000">Cumtity</font> found <font color="#FF0000">Mr Rogers</font> naked and on his back in the middle of 
the frozen river, and helped him to his senses by slapping him silly with her…….comments. Where are you? What’s your name? 
You get the idea. Eventually he got his butt unstuck and went inside. Decidedly, the beer was making the ice more slippery 
then normally.</p>

<p>We had just thought to go back upstairs, when <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoovah</font> said it was time to sauna, so 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Ski Bobbit</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Taste Like Chicken</font> went back. With <font color="#FF0000">Trail</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">TLC</font>, this time in the altogether, it made the scenery much more pleasant, and a much better balance 
of breasts to wieners. Although <font color="#FF0000">TLC</font> thought otherwise about jumping in freezing water, 
<font color="#FF0000">Trail</font> had no reservations and with abandon inhibition she went under. Needing help to pull 
herself out, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> offered her his hand and got an eyeful. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
could have used some help too, but it was more than we could stand to see this big naked guy pulling his butt out of the 
hole and promply sitting down and getting ass and peripherals stuck to the frozen ice. Many more splash-downs were enjoyed 
before retiring to the pharty upstairs. The sauna was left to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> in full <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> attire… for about 3 hours.</p>

<p>Upstairs the fun was happin’, as someone plugged an Ipod into sound system and everyone was dancing. This was the most 
booty we had dancing in Rumney, ever, mostly because it was the most women staying overnight, ever. <font color="#FF0000">
Cumtity</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Beat by a Girl</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dog Meat</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Sweet Molasses</font> and others were shaken it up, but it was ‘bout time to pump it up a notch. People were consuming 
beer by the buckets and it really started to look like a good ole hash. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> found himself 
on a chair dancing naked with hoot calls coming from a male non-hashing artist neighbor. <font color="#FF0000">CT</font> 
was showing how to do Naked Aircraft Carrier Landings.</p>

<p>As some retired and the music mellowed, we finished the night with a game of charades. The best had to be <font 
color="#FF0000">Cumtity</font> getting naked jumping on the floor trying to get the word ‘stripping’. Second best was ‘two 
polar bears wrestling in the snow’; you had to be there. All the losers had to run naked around the house in the snow 
holding there toes and saying, “Ooomi Goomlies!” It was time for some of us to hit the sack, but not before <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> came upstairs after his 3 hours sauna, and said he was driving home sometime after midnight. 
What goes on in the sauna; stays in the sauna!</p>

<p>Next morning we were awoke by the smell of bacon, coffee and eggs, and surveyed the damage. The keg was dead, two 
barrels were filled with beer bottles, an empty Single Malt bottle, and a good chunk of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
Brew was gone.  After all enjoyed ‘Breakfast By <font color="#FF0000">Cums Alone</font>’, we made the Hash House 
presentable. Then one by one we packed our stuff and made our way home. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> decided not to 
say over, but had gone up to Waterville Valley for some private time with <font color="#FF0000">JBS</font>. As he wasn’t 
around at cleanup, Boston decided to help <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, by taking his home brew and equipment to 
their hash. This made for some exciting comments from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> about <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> authorized WHOM to ‘STEAL’ his beer. ‘Don’t mess with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> Beer!’</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> contacted him to let him know that he didn’t have to travel from Waterville Valley 
to Rumney as none of his ‘stuff’ was there and all he could hear was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> speak, you know 
the F word in multiples and how he was holding him personally responsible if it wouldn’t be returned the following day at 
the RIH3.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it didn’t show and the <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> Show was on at Sticks.</p>

<p><font color="#008000">Run #1091A</font>, February 26, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Location:</font> Sticks Tavern, Harmony, RI</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Weather:</font> Cold with 3 inches of fresh snow</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Oozing, Bondo, Justin and Async.<br>
Conspicuously missing were: WHO, Amish, Eenie Weenie, WIPOS and Fuwangii as they were licking their wounds from NH.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had been speaking to <font color="#FF0000">Just Stephanie</font> about joining us 
for her virgin Hash. Her boyfriend <font color="#FF0000">Play Thru</font> has been hashing on Okinawa and told her what a 
great time he’s had, so she wanted to join us. He was hoping she would do her first ‘un’, and I was hoping to take 
pictures to send to him before he deploys to Iraq the following week.  Unfortunately someone gave her bad d’erections 
(<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was that?) and she didn’t show until 7:30. After a few beers in Sticks Tavern, while 
waiting for the Hash to return, she got bored and drove home to UCON where she works, with promises to join us after the 
basketball season. We’ll see!</p>

<p>The parking lot behind Sticks Tavern on Rte 44 was cold and covered in snow as <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Justin Myass</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> arrived. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> was already pissing and moaning about his missing stuff, taken to the Boston Hash the day before, and blaming 
everyone in earshot. Hmmmmm, maybe <font color="#FF0000">Just Stephanie</font> was there and decided these guys didn’t 
deserve to see her ‘un’. After ignoring a number of attempts to accept blame for the missing crap, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> started out setting trail live in the fresh snow using blue flour. He was reminded by <font color="#FF0000">
Justin</font> that blue is not the best color, but then <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> is color blind and wouldn’t 
see any color anyway. The trail was also marked in toilet paper and footprints, however, so he was pretty sure even 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> in a blind tirade could have followed it.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> arrived just after <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> left, driving over the bar’s 
snow covered leach field, doing wheelies in the snow, which brought the owner out complaining. Quickly, the pack started 
out behind the bar, west through a nursery and circling back crossing Rte 44 into the Glocester Forest and Phillips Farm 
Reserve. Trail meandered through a field, then woods, over hill and dale, and arriving on the Melody Hill Golf Course, 
where beer would be found. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Justin</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, who said <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was in rare form the entire trail. Evidently 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> set off a maelstrom by telling <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> that <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> authorized the BH3 to take his stuff.</p>

<p>When <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> arrived he was yelling so loud that a herd of deer that just ran through the 
field were heading into the next county. Beer eventually led to almost silent contemplation as the Fuc*s became less 
obtrusive. If we used the <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> scale this one was off the charts.</p>

<p>Eventually we finished the beer and made our way back to the start. Down downs were given to the hare, and to 
backsliding <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for stealing <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> stuff and not bringing the promised virgin. Then we settled down to Chester’s on the Right 
Side of Rte 44 for food and quiet metaphysical discussion as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> went home.</p>

<p>Just another successful Hash Weekend.</p>
