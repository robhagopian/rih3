Trail started down in Big River which is normally too far for your scribe to get to after work but this is now the time of COVID. Even with snow accumulating decently north of Boston, traffic was so light I was able to leave work after 5 and still make it on time. Of course it was all rain south of the Massachusetts border setting up a soggy trail.<br/><br/>
With a quick chalk talk, Oozing set out in the lead and pack followed - winding our way towards Tarbox Pond. I caught up with Basket coming back from a YBF and picked up trail - thinking I might be hearing Oozing calling RU? from the pond and assumed he blew through the YBF. Basket was running down checks with the same intensity of the rain was pouring down. The hare and Virgin Lydia attempted to sweep but kept getting in front of the back of pack. At times this was necessary as I'm told that some marks were covered up with mud. WHO was out in the rain covering up marks with mud is beyond me but we'll forgive him. Trail went up a hill to a ridge and back down again with switchbacks and unrelenting rain.<br/><br/>
After roughly a mile and a half I arrived at the beer nestled up at Carr's Pond. Thankfully I was able to locate it and dig past the individually bagged orange food and some decoy beers to find the sweet nectar of Captain's Daughter. There was some chatting, social distancing, and a song or two but no Oozing. The hare did a bunch of yelling and light flashing and eventually we located Oozing on the other side of the pond (where trail did not venture). It's still not clear to me how he managed that but I hear it involved the out trail. We had another beer waiting for him to make it around and finally, as I was just getting too cold to hang around, Oozing finally made it to the beer. There was much rejoicing and we started back to the cars on another approximately mile and a half out trail. Cars were started, and one that was too close to the circle was turned off, we asked questions of the Virgin no Just Lydia, and I was assigned hashit for some reason lost to me now. We managed to get through it all at appropriate distances and then packed up and left. Food was a sandwich I brought. I
was home and in bed by 10:30pm - it was glorious.
