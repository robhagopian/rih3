<p>Now you would think, by the theme, that the Hare had 
an epic in store for us. Certainly a trail of such proportions and magnitude 
that it would take a Herculean effort to stage. The location aided the hare, 
with hills, and valleys, and steams and rocky outcroppings, which offered vistas 
so grand, that one had only tread lightly upon the trail to realize, but would 
sap the strength of all to finish. The weather was perfect this glorious late 
autumn evening, temperature just below freezing with light breeze.</p>

<p>And so with great trepidation, we ventured out 
behind the Lodge heading east, where the first check encountered had some 
dodging traffic crossing Rte 123, into Lincoln Woods. Others east and west on 
123, until <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> found flour passing in front of 
our previous location, then crossing the road and into the woods. The circle 
jerk was just enough to warm the lungs, sending hot fluid to the legs to dodge 
the speeding cars, particularly since Jersey Barriers were set up along the road 
construction, bringing vehicles extremely close to bone and flesh. It also 
afforded late cumers <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Smelly Beaver 9</font> to arrive, fashionably late, and join the pack.</p>

<p>The trail continued straight uphill; turning left, 
then right, then straight to the rear entrance roadway. A check here, once 
again, had most looking in all the wrong directions, when the
<font color="#FF0000">Bad Doctor</font> found flour crossing the road and around 
some large boulders. The trail meandered along a well worn path heading east 
still, ran up and around a large crest, before heading quickly down a steep grade.</p>

<p>Another check at the bottom, sent all over some 
fallen trees, and then up a hill. Eventually winding up at the burned 
outbuilding, where a large B was discovered. Now, normally a Beer Check would be 
well appreciated, especially given the quickly dropping temperatures, but since 
we had traveled less than a mile, all wondered if we were being duped by the Hare.</p>

<p>It was not so, as after looking for 5 minutes, the 
hare found no one discovered his hiding place, and generously dug the bag out of 
the leafy covering. Having been so quickly to arrive at the beer stop, we 
inquired if there may be 2 beer stops on the trail. The hare replied that there 
would not, and we started wondering how much effort he afforded this event.</p>

<p>Many songs were sung, and the sweet harmonica, of 
the <font color="#FF0000">Good Doctor</font> accompanied us. Realizing the 
brevity of the evening, we continued singing and drinking until well after
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> started out. He tries to save his energy for 
the grand events, and usually walks back in, whenever opportunity knocks. He 
often takes a wrong turn, however, and we usually catch up to him before long. 
Such was the case this evening, as he took the right trail, which turned out to 
be the wrong trail. We all continued left to the entrance road, and in towards the Lodge.</p>

<p>The Circle was formed by the small pond near the 
YWCA, and as the hare was given his Down-Down for a slacking effort, and the run 
was rated a negative 69 to 69<sup>th</sup> power. Frozen crystals fell on our 
faces, as it started to lightly rain Down-Downs we also given to co-hare
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, the <font color="#FF0000">Good Doctor</font> 
for blowing her harp, and the cohabiting duo of <font color="#FF0000">EBSM</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font>. Hashit was give to <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font>. We sang and drank and it was magical looking across the glistening 
water, with a horse prancing to our tunes, in the paddock. Then we adjourned 
into the Lodge for food and beer on what may be the shortest hash since the Moon’s.</p>

<p>Give back the land indeed. Considering the Hare’s 
heritage and militant nature, it should read “Take Back the Land, sadly, the 
verb ‘GIVE’ better fit the occasion, as in Give us a Better Trail next time.</p>

<p>On On,</font></p>
