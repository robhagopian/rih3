<p>The Great Bodhisattva once said, &quot; When I want it to rain, I just tell God, 'let it rain!', you see...I have a 
direct connection with God himself.&quot; Well, maybe.</p>

<p>And so it rained, and rained...and rained, till it could rain no more, but then it did. And so a soggy pack of sorry 
looking hashers gathered in a puddle of a parking lot next to the Slatersville Reservoir to commemorate years of sunnier 
Memorial Day hashes, days in which the oven was used with abandon, in which electricity was rendered &quot;a given&quot;, 
and the warmth of the sun was simply overlooked.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>, the hare, was wearing enough rain gear as to make <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font> look naked. Upper thigh-high rubber wading boots, red shorts, some sort of rain jacket and head apparatus, and 
a small bag of flour in which to set the darn trail live since the heavens had broke open. Only a small patch of skin could 
be seen around his eyes and groin area. A caravan driven by the rain-maker himself, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo 
Jovi</font>, also contained <font color="#FF0000">Shine On Harvard Moon</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and 
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Just Jean Paul</font>, running about in a red poncho, looking 
much like little red riding hood, and <font color="#FF0000">Virgin Steve</font>, sounding a lot like <font color="#FF0000">
Snotty </font>to some, jumped about into a few puddles and joined the crowd. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner </font>
drove up in his bed-on-wheels, only to park directly into the smaller Slatersville Reservoir forming in the parking lot. 
Just Ian almost busted a tire rounding into the lot at the nick of 6:30 as not to miss the start. With no BH3ers or Newporters in site and many RIH3er MIA with sorry excuses for their absence, the pack whimpered off on trail after giving 
the hare 10 minutes to go get himself lost.<font color="#FF0000"> Short Peck </font>was also seen milling around the lot, 
although he was no where to be found on trail.</p>

<p>Off they went, following high wires and busting through private property with abandon, since no one in their right 
half-mind would be out with their sharp shooters protecting their property in such weather. Earlier threats of swim tests 
and boating maneuvers proved to be nothing but talk, as the trail followed mainly recycled territory on paths and some 
bushwhacking through the woods. There were a few exciting moments of washed out bridges on trail, poison ivy non-maneuvers, 
but nothing really compared to the great dam debacle! A Beer Check mark was spotted on the pavement near a fence somewhere 
after they leapt from the shallow woods. <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> and<font color="#FF0000"> Shine 
on </font>were seen on the other side of a roaring and recklessly flowing river, underneath the bridge of the road above, 
smiling and holding the beer containers with malicious glee.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, Just Jean Paul</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Virgin Steve</font> were the first of many hashers to wade through the whirling waters to beer and safety 
on the other side. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> soon followed with somewhat 
sketchy agility. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tried to point out the bridge (&quot;bridge, what bridge?&quot;) above 
their heads, but that would have required actual brain power and avoidance of the most thrilling part of the trail! The 
Bodhisavah, unable to tap into his Direct Link to the Powers That Be, did not try and stop the river from rushing, claiming 
he &quot;forgot&quot; about his powers.  Instead he used his mortal limbs to cross, almost becoming a cast away. Just Ian 
was the only one to heed the warnings of the hare (or maybe the only smart one) and took the bridge to safety. Beer was 
had, and the dogs smacked sticks into the backs of people's legs per usual.</p>

<p>Lead by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> off they went more wet than before (if that was possible), through shallow 
woods, neighborhoods and on back to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> house. A tarp was set up outside as to keep 
people &quot;dry&quot; in the circle. The electricity had been extinguished while the hash was floating about the trail. 
The Great Bodhisattva, who must have got a busy signal while Direct Dialing into the Pearly Gate's Main Line, left the hash 
without lights, oven, the microwave and the like. A roaring fire was made BY HAND in the fireplace for all to warm their 
private parts and the gas grill outside was a-cookin'. The toilet was not to be flushed due to the Narragansett Electric 
mishap, so everyone either held it, or went in <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> pool.</p>

<p>The circle was joined by *gasp* four BH3 late comers, <font color="#FF0000">Friar F*ck, Muffolata,</font> (both were a 
1/2 hour late coming from Newport in the rain), <font color="#FF0000">Cream Whora</font> (dressed in sheep gear as to make 
a Scottish lad weep) and <font color="#FF0000">More Seamen Please</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat </font>and 
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> remained in the darkened kitchen for most of the circle to prepare food by candlelight 
over a open hearth, bare feet and pregnant. Virgin Steve (he hashed in England, but we don't really give a</p>

<p>damn) was dementressed by <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> and had some difficulty drinking his down-down (how 
un-English like!). The Visitors sang &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; as their song of choice. The hare gave his hash*t to 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, who was out with <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> looking for <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Ian</font>, who the pack suddenly realized went missing on trail.  <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Ian</font> also left his keys in his car, so not only was he lost in the Monsoon of 2003 and almost forgotten by the 
fellow hashers, but he also had <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> as his rescue squad!! Hoping that The Great Bodhisattva 
would find his All Knowing Affiliation Card to the Enlightened Club, hash religion was sung, much food was eaten 
(Ambrosia Salad!) and bras were cast off. Eventually <font color="#FF0000">Bondo,</font> <font color="#FF0000">Short 
Peck</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Ian</font>, and the electricity came back just in time to see the Red Sox beat 
the Yankees in the Bronx. So there is a God!</p>

<p>P.S. Oh ya, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Ian</font> went missing for another 1 
hour or more after we ate and watched tv. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> sailed <font color="#FF0000">Just Ian</font> 
back to the newly formed Slatersville Reservoir Yacht Club and tried to slim-jim open <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Ian's</font> car to no avail. SO, the Non-Enlightened one, having lost his Hookup to the Heavens, drove poor Ian all the 
way to Woonsocket, where <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> made BY HAND his own Slim Jim in his garage (having lost his 
original tool) and drove back to Slatersville to opened the car door, now 1/2 way swallowed in the Great Lake of 
Slatersville. Names like &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Bondo's Bitch&quot;</font> floated around the tv-stricken room with 
no stickiness, so <font color="#FF0000">Just Ian</font> remains nameless for now. So much for Just Ian being the 
&quot;only smart one&quot;.</p>
