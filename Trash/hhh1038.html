<p>Park-and-Rides after dark are popular with male homosexuals, mass murderers, extreme perverts and hashers. Bimbos 
(except perhaps <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>) don’t seem to get much out of these runs. Perhaps this is why most 
of our P&R hashes are stag affairs. The hare, perhaps inspired by the Bunny version of “Brokeback Mountain” 
(<a href="http://www.starz.com/features/brokebackmountain/" target="new">
http://www.starz.com/features/brokebackmountain/</a>) set a run from the Park-and-Ride at exit 6A, not 6. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> certainly couldn’t resist. Nor did <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> even think about 
skipping out. With the hare and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, it was four 
happy couples who set off into the woods that night.</p>

<p>Trail started off crossing southeast under 95 on Hopkins Hill Road. A quick check turned them east into some woods for 
a brief bushwhack. The marks were weak: little flour, and very sparse. They all kept together as they came onto a trail 
that looped back down to Division Street, and turned southwest. Marks on the road were followed back to Hopkins Hill Road. 
The hare tried to restore order as confusion became rampant. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> went south on Hopkins Hill. The rest continued on Division until called back by the hare, and 
directed into the Sand-and-Gravel Pit south of the road.</p>

<p>Having thought that the marks were poor before, they discovered that they had had it pretty good. The marks were now 
completely invisible. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> pressed on. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> had turned back, and entered the pits to come upon the 
hare who was pleading with <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> to notice one of his flour blobs. He led them back to the 
road, where they were joined by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>. They 
crossed back into the woods, heading east on trails. Where were <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>? No one knew. Or cared!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> now led, east and north, for a reasonably enjoyable stretch (although 
Shiggy-free!) A few checks, a little bushwhack here and there, and of course, no <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> or 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Trail led north across Division, into a field, where a cooler was found, hidden in the 
middle of the path. <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> not complaining! Beer was opened, and some songs were sung. For 
reasons that even he cannot explain, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> decided to let loose with a few blasts from his 
whistle, before the beer was even finished. How dumb can you get! <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, sated from whatever disgusting activity had passed between them alone in the woods, heard 
the sound, and emerged from the brush.</p>

<p>It happened that the hare intended for this to be both BC and Circle. (Cheap Bastard!) So bowing to the inevitable, the 
circle was called to order. Ratings for the run: fair weather, not enough snow, no shiggy, BC and Circle together, no 
bimbos, and the reappearance of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>: <b>-69</b>! 
Hashit obviously went to <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> for reckless misbehavior at the BC.</p>

<p>The hare loaded them up in his previously concealed vehicle and drove the group back to the cars. They tried for the 
On On On at Marks (exit 6, not 6A) but there was remodeling going on (or was there?). They were forced to turn to the 
former West Greenwich Inn, now the Big River Inn, for sustenance. Not bad, although they might want to rename it the Big 
River Arms, after the muscular waitress that served them. But at least there was a slight exposure to estrogen this night. 
God knows, we need it!</p>
