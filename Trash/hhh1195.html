style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">A second week in 
a row where the dominating feature of the hash was ice. This was a major factor 
in the completely glass-ice covered sloping parking lot. Early arrival <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> soon found this out, as his car ended up in a slow 
slide to the base of the lot. It remained stuck there until rescued by <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT> with salt quickly procured from a nearby 
Cumberland Farms, and by <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> with a 
cobbled-together tow-line. So the hash began a bit late, at about 
6:50.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoNoSpacing><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">It was ice all 
the way for the run also. The start was uphill (on ice) northwest, and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> fell. There was a loop north and south which allowed 
the laggards to shortcut. <FONT color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT> fell. They 
turned west. <FONT color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> fell. Trail turned north with a 
long falsie west. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> fell. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wrung 
Guy</FONT> fell also. Another false trail continued north, while true trail 
turned east and south. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT> fell. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> fell. The hare fell. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> fell, again. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Finally, they reached the beer check. The 
hare began an annoying conversation (one-sided) about cricket (a boring 
discourse about an even more boring sport). During this, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT> received a phone call from his better 
half.&nbsp;He was doing pretty well convincing her that he was helping a friend 
move a sofa, when the hash chorus stepped up the volume. Caught 
again!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>On Out trail led south to parking area. 
They circled up. The run was rated based upon the ice shiggy, but the lack of 
bimbos, lack of anyone (Basket) lost on trail, and the late start led to a total 
of: +0.69. Hashit to <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> seemed a virtual certainty. 
But <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was rescued. The rescuer has to pay! <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT> was Hashit by a unanimous vote. On On On was at 
Champions, <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>which was almost empty, 
and hence more tolerant of our behavior.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
