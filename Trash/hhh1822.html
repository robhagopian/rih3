Shemale Hared this anal event with his son's help and it showed. The marks were plenty and well placed. SMM brought plenty of beer and scotch to sweetn' the pot, and there was enough (possible) shiggy to make this short trail enjoyable. 
We joined the Hares and his dad at his apartment house in Smithfield. A hot fire was roaring in the back yard, but for some reason we all stood in the parking lot behind 37 Stillwater Rd, blocked traffic for the tenants. After enjoying a beer and a wee nippy we circled for Chalk Talk. The Hare cautioned that we shouldn't fall into the river or pond. Good advice as the temperature was 27 degrees and dropping. <br/><br/>
The trail left the driveway and started out towards the Woonasquatucket. Crossing the walkway, marks were found heading south on Cross Street where a check had me going into Whipple Park, with no luck. WHO found flour crossing Whipple Ave to another check at Higgins St. Trail went behind and through the old Homestead Mill complex. I stayed on Higgins and was first to greet the Hare on the banks of Georgiaville Pond.<br/><br/>
Complaining, he stated that I had shortcutted. It seems like that's acceptable Hash behavior to me. I started out towards the parking lot, but he called me back to wait for the pack. He said, "WHO was almost dead" and he had to give him a shortcut, but he had yet to arrive. I thought that was bullshit and WHO just trying to weasel information out of the Hare. Again, acceptable Hash behavior if you can get away with it.br/><br/>
Rusty was first to join us at the top of the berm, and I soon followed him down to the side of the lake. We continued, stupidly, along the bank, until we hit some ice covered riprap. I slipped and then I slid face down along the rocks and onto the thinly ice covered lake. It was just thick enough to keep me from getting wet. I decided it would be safer to head uphill to the parking lot, and met the Hare and the smarter Wankers heading to the Beer Stop. Shemale chuckled a bit s he watched Rusty trudging along the bank, and waited for him to pop out as we joined Amish and Ralph on the trail. <br/><br/>
The Wniskey Stop was found just below the dam along the small but impressive gorge. The river was flowing pretty fast and it was a bit sketchy looking for the scotch along the steep leave-strewn steep bank. I think Rusty found it and we all enjoyed a wee nippy. A few songs were sung before moving on to the Beer Stop. <br/><br/>
The trail continued along the river until it soon crossed over a downed log onto the small island. I was a bit past the tree and found flour coming uphill from the BS. Running this part of the trail backwards, I found that crossing the log was not easy, but I got to the beer and offered tossing one to Amish on the other side with Ralph. SMM offered to carry one to him and we had one or two songs there. Then it was back across he logs and back to the start. <br/><br/>
The Circle ensued by the fire with Shemale on ice. The ratings were surprisingly high for a Shemale Hash. He got a negative 6.9 and sang a song off key but hit most of the verses. SMM was also the Backslider, so his dad asked him 3 questions. He got one or two close and drank again. The fire was raging, and we statted a discussion about Hashit. A number of Wankers were brought up, but SMM suggested me and so there it is. After swing low we enjoyed the best Haggis, Scotch Eggs, Scotch Broth, Tatties and Neeps that we've had all year. We finished the night with another wee nippy and a visit by the Smithfield FD to put out the firepit. Pitiful end to a short shitty trail!
