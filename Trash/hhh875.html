<p>It’s such a shame that this hare has lost his creativity. He is over 50 now, and I 
suppose we should give him credit for longevity. Tonight’s trail was a Re-Hash 
of at least 5 previous events, all of which resulted in the hare setting trail 
the day before, walking leisurely along with his faithful hounds, sucking down a 
beer. Then, on the evening of the grand event, letting hashers fend for 
themselves, while he goes driving to the beer stop, without even so much of a 
drop of perspiration expended. Is it any wonder poor Jake has posted a few extra 
pounds these last few years, and let’s not even go near <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> belly.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of him setting a hash in exactly the same location, but 
needing the help of his offspring. The trail was the same, but the cast changed:</p>

<p>No Co-Hare needed, <font color="#FF0000">Bone Head Fuwangi Boner</font> played Rusty, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> played Crisco Kid, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> played Peter, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
Played Sajid, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> played <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font>, 
and NoOne could have played Gobble Gobble.</p>

The venue was Woonsocket and the 
attendance being quite respectable at ten including Bondo and Bondo junior (hare 
and co-hare), Basket, Async (returned from his posting), Rusty (Newport), Crisco 
Kid (Newport), Gobble Gobble, Peter (new boots), Sajid (new boots) and of course 
yours truly, Snot after missing last week because of Hewy and Ralph. (Cockney 
term for sick). Peter (new boots) was attracted to our running fraternity due to 
the article written in the Providence Journal on December 25 1996 by Tom Meade 
(alias Plume), “Harriettes” he had the nerve to call us, so I guess Peter was 
alarmed to see no females last night, only full blooded male Harriers although 
Sheilas are always welcome. He said the hash was “Modeled on the old English 
schoolboy game of hares and hounds” well I don’t know where you read that crap 
but in England this is no game based around school kids, but a big boys and 
girls game who would take great delight at shoving your plume where there is no 
blue ink and chasing you around the English country side shouting ‘tally ho’ if 
they ever read that article. The article was a bit vague on the facts not to 
mention the RIH3 web site was wrong. I think my dear Plume you owe us another 
article which I would be happy to help you with some accurate info. At the very 
least you should attend another run for a down down for your poor rendition. 
It’s no wonder we only got one inquiry.<br><br>

Back to the run where the 
runners were equipped with very sexy running shorts one size fitted all (even 
yours truly got them around my large backside), no expense spared with the 
printing still hot off the press, a rare give away, but should be classified in 
the same realm as the condom-use once, throw away. But I am sure Basket will 
wash them to use again, or turn them inside out.<br><br>

With all runners fully attired 
the off was at 6.45pm through a nice housing estate onto an old railway line or 
maybe it’s the new one the city is building-difficult to tell. Over a few roads 
with drivers agog at the fashionable new shorts we were sporting. With a few 
crafty checks catching out the FRB’s. The unusual part of this run was the 
co-hare who would shout out “this way you dickheads” at every check, the more 
experienced runners ignored this unusual behavior as the hare is normally a 
lying sack of shit. This hare however was a bit wet behind the ears and knew no 
better. Async and Rusty as always were out at the front and Basket was out there 
somewhere carving his own trail. Eventually the trail led us around Harris pond 
up to the beer stop, Basket appeared with a video of Lassie go Home which is a 
pornographic depiction of the Harriers chasing the Harriettes which Basket wants 
to give to the Plume. Basket as always entered into his accent which is a mix of 
Scottish, Irish, Cockney slang and Providence dribble. Never the less it was 
amusing as always. Basket is the first person in America to be rejected by every 
living psychiatrist which are the credentials required to run in RIH3.<br><br>

The on back was a slog through 
forest where yours truly was leading the pack for a while because you other 
silly bastards went the wrong way and the co-hare sort of gave it away by saying 
“where the f*** are they going”. A neat idea was introduced for our blind 
runners (which includes all of you silly sods that missed the last check in the 
woods). Bondo carried the empties in his back pack and when he wobbled they 
clinked. All back except one of our new boots Sajid who incidently got lost 
trying to get to one of our other runs. Maybe a handle could come easily like 
‘Lost Again’ or ‘Dickhead’. Gobble Gobble and yours truly went out searching for 
this virgin with no luck but returned to find Sajit supping a beer.<br><br>

Circle was formed ratings for 
the run given with the exception of one (new boot) all thought the absence of 
shiggy was sinful, hence nothing more than a minus three was given which was 
about average for the year. Bondo junior liked the grog so much he kept his 
woolly hat (which his mum had knitted him for Xmas) on for a second drink and in 
true Russian style threw his mug across the garage, somebody should tell him it 
works better with glass. A new handle was suggested for Bondo junior by Douche 
Face who did not run on this occasion as his heart rate was beating normal at 
72BPM which could have been risky. The handle of Jovi Juice was nominated and 
carried by the membership to which the recipient was duly baptized. Before the 
circle broke Newport Hash awarded Basket BB a mug which they charged him for, we 
can only guess it was to match the rest of his attire, two flashlights, two 
bugles now two mugs. (RIH3 mugs are now available at around $25 please submit 
orders to yours truly, alias Snot.)<br><br>

Circle items completed we then 
retired to Bondo’s home for some brilliant soup and grog-a touch more pepper in 
the soup next time. The dynamic pool duo of Bondo and Snot beat everybody in 
sight, until the end when Bondo deliberately missed the black to allow Basket 
and Rusty their first win of the year- Rusty, you should get a partner that can 
shoot straight!<br><br>

On-On<br><br>
