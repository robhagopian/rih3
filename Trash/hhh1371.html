Hashshit- Hairy<br><br>

The pack went across a field, through a pretty little garden, then over some hills and rocks and shit. Crossed the river and then the pack found the beer, and plenty of the potent shit there was.<br><br>
There wasn’t much singing; we all knew what was in store for the out trail. Grabbing each other’s noodles, we began to float down river, avoiding rocks and trees and shit. Rusty showed everyone how poorly an Irishman swims. Oozing couldn’t handle the noodle grabbing and bushwacked the shoreline. Pat My ReTurd showed everyone her turkeys were done. Hairy found a rotting snapping turtle.<br><br>
Opting to traverse the breachway instead of the falls (LAME) we scared the shit out of a fisherman.  Arriving back at the cars basket ran off to fetch his, only to return driving in the nude. Hairy stole a pitcher of beer out the back of baskets car and we had a prelube before leaving for circle at basket’s house.

The circle formed after much whining and dogmeat joined sporting her newly customized hash apron.  Hairy doesn’t remember anyone’s shitty comments on the run. He does (unfortunately) remember the moment in circle when the hare began jumping over the fire, naked. (Seemed to be baskets night for being naked) Circle nominated Hairy as the hashit, He had to pee.<br><br>
Dogmeat had prepared authentic NYS wieners that were the best thing for my breath at the dentist the following morning.<br>
