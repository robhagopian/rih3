<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The 969<sup>th</sup> “Run For The Hashit” coincided with Halloween, so the RIH3 responded by doing nothing in 
particular. No T-shirt, no publicity, incompetent haring, etc. Another classic in the making. But it was Halloween, 
and a daylight run, at that. The usual Monday evening time was switched to Sunday afternoon to show off the costumes 
(and to confuse <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>). Despite all this, the Newport H3 got wind of the event and 
showed up in force. And in costume, as well.  <font color="#FF0000">Sackless Suction</font> of the Newport H3 provided 
the following description of the costumes, so your scribe has edited and stolen them from him:</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000">Kiddie Porn</font> (Cannes Film Festival reject), <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Michelle</font> (Cindi Lauper), <font color="#FF0000">Sparky the Hobosexual </font>(the Dork Prince of Heck), 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Bert </font>(bare-ass mental patient), <font color="#FF0000">Free Willy</font>(a puppy), 
<font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> (Cheerleader sans spankies), <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> 
(Lance &quot;Uniball&quot; Armstrong), <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom </font>(The Scotsman), <font 
color="#FF0000">Miss Gay Rhode Island</font> (first: unimaginative golfer, second: glam Mr. Potatohead), <font 
color="#FF0000">Sweet and Adorable E.B. RIPTA</font> (Mizz Potatohead), <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> 
(a lavatory mummy), <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> (a Woonsocket prison inmate), <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi 
Boner</font> (a Woonsocket Police Officer),&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> (the sociopathological 
leprechaun), <font color="#FF0000">Sackless Suction</font> (Dr. Clayton Forrester), <font color="#FF0000">Bush 
Yaaker </font>(learning the importance of not being seen) and our faithful hare <font color="#FF0000">Oozing 
Syphilitic Dictaphone</font> (the Ghost of the Curse of the Bambino).</i></p>

<p>After some prelubing courtesy of the ever-present <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> traveling/emergency keg, and 
after giving the hare a 15 minute head start, they were off. Trail started from the parking lot on Armstrong Ave in 
Fox Point, and quickly emerged on Wickenden at a check mark. The Newporters, being ignorant of the East Side’s 
geography had no trouble with the trail. They simply followed the marks, which consisted of ample flour as well as 
pieces of <font color="#FF0000">SESYB’s</font> disintegrating toilet paper costume. [There was considerable incentive 
here. But unfortunately, she had uncharitably worn shorts and a t-shirt under the <i>papier</i>. All were ultimately 
disillusioned. But I digress.] They continued east down Wickenden. The more experienced RIH3-ers had much more 
difficulty, mainly due to preconceived notions about where the trail should go. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
crossed the bridge over 195,<font color="#FF0000"> Fuwangi </font>headed north on Brook and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> went into Tockwotten Park. But gradually making their way east, the stragglers encountered <font 
color="#FF0000">Free Willy</font> just as they rediscovered the trail on Gano St.. Without hesitation, and encouraged 
by the sighting of more and more fragments from <font color="#FF0000">SESYB’s</font> biodegradeable costume, they 
plunged through a Cape Verdean soccer match and entered some shiggy at the old RR bridge.</p>

<p>The shiggy was all too short, and they soon found themselves on George St, with trail turning north through 
Wayland Square. Again <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> outsmarted 
themselves, theorizing that the trail must lead back into the prime shiggy of Blackstone Park, or at least wind up 
in Swan Point Cemetery. While the rest turned up Angel, these two turned back down to Butler and Blackstone Blvd. 
Even <font color="#FF0000">Polly</font> was smart enough not to follow them this time. The trail wound around 
the neighborhoods, and generally turned back west, uphill. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>now took the lead, 
and closely pursued by <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, made it up past Moses Brown School, and onto Thayer 
Street, where he was able to snare the hare. Having no interest in depantsing the hare, he and <font color="#FF0000">
SESYB</font> agreed to hang back, and give the hare some time.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/969/stone%20lady.jpg" width="375" height="281"></p>

<p>Meanwhile, through a process of blind luck, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> found themselves ahead of the pack who were doggedly following the true trail, despite obvious 
short-cutting opportunities. [Perhaps it was because <font color="#FF0000">Sackless Suction</font> kept trying to 
recruit joggers to the hash. Most of them were nubile young college girls, who had caught up and passed the 
“running” hashers with little effort. Not much chance there. But I digress.] Regardless, Thayer St was subjected to 
the second wave, led by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> (until the fitter <font color="#FF0000">Bush Yaaker</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Just Bert</font> passed him).&nbsp; They crossed Waterman and at a check opposite the 
east entrance to the Brown Yard, they regrouped. <font color="#FF0000">WHO </font>finally picked up trail going 
through the Yard west.</p>

<p>Only just ahead were the dawdling <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>; and 
just ahead of them was the hare. When <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> emerged onto Prospect Street a chase began. The 
hare looked doomed until a siren started and the Providence Police zoomed up to investigate the scene. A running 
ghost, the running policeman, the running mummy/litterbug, a running Scotsman who had just appeared, and the running 
prisoner in a fluorescent orange jumpsuit were seen heading north on Prospect.&nbsp; Hearing the sirens, the hashers 
slowed and tried to look inconspicuous. Just before the police drew their weapons, they took a closer look. In the 
nick of time, they remembered that it was Halloween, and zoomed off down Angel, pretending to be answering a real 
call. After giving the hare his third(!) headstart of the hash, the FRB’s turned into the RISD Administration Garden. 
They ignored the statuary boob check and followed the exceptionally fresh trail out to Congdon, and to Prospect Park. 
A few photo-ops with some tourists, and they were back on, down Bowen and through a back parking lot to the hare’s 
and the BC.</p>

<p>The straggler gradually rolled in and grabbed a beer (Trinity IPA from a fresh keg). Inventory was taken, songs 
were begun. Only two were missing: <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Michelle</font>. Contrary to the usual policy, it was felt that search parties should be sent out as the RIH3 needs 
all the bimbos it can get. But they finally straggled in without help. The rhubarb began to rise in earnest for 
once, especially when <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> proved that she had skipped the panties under her 
sheer panty hose, and cheerleaders skirt. Some cartwheels were suggested, but declined. WOW, MOM!</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/969/fuwangi%20etc%20circle.jpg" width="375" height="281"></p>

<p>And what does the RIH3 do when they have had six or seven beers, and sung twenty or thirty songs? Why circle up, 
of course, and sing twenty or thirty more! The run was rated: There was no shiggy, but it was Halloween, all were 
costumed, there were bimbos, boneheads and beer: +6.9! Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, because it always 
seems to fit him best. Visitors were punished, songs were sung, beer was consumed. Then, songs were sung. Then, for 
variety, some beer was sipped. After some more songs, religion was performed, and the group made their way back 
down Benefit St to the cars. The On On On was across in East Providence, at the Red Bridge Tavern. But the Pats 
were playing, and your scribe was Trick-or-treating in Tiverton by this time, so that’s all there is.</p>
