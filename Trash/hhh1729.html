Hashit: Basket<br/><br/>

It's been a while since NW laid flour for the RIH3, and there was a concern he may have forgotten how to satisfy our wants and needs. Rain came down in buckets overnight and any flour on the ground would have been long gone. The Hare said he just reset it 2 hours before our start. So I won't be able to use the excuse that the rain washed away the marks, as a reason for getting lost this time around. We were sharing a beer from Fecal's car when a caravan of cars arrived, including a tall Wanker from the Air Force stationed in Turkey and a good selection of regulars. The Hare was dressed, as PG so adeptly noted, in proper New Hampshire gear. Cut-off short and a tee shirt. The rest of us were bundled up like WIPOS on an early March day. The wind was just brisk enough to give a shiver to my quiver, and at least one of us went back to put on another layer, Eh, Rusty? Frosty was last to arrive and the Hare gave a short Chalk-Talk before sending us on our way.<br/><br/>
Trail led down under the 95 overpasses and right into Big River. A check had some going straight (me) and most followed flour right into the dunes. I saw what looked like a heavy pair of running shoes in the sand and followed them hoping it was the Hare running back from setting the Beer Stop. Rusty was on trail and called me towards him on my right. Behind me I saw OOzing, Pubic and a couple other Wankers working their way across the sand. We all joined together as we entered the scrub and trees, then crossed the Division Road and into the Dunes. <br/><br/>
A whisky (bourbon) stop brought us all together, and despite the size of the crowd, no singing was attempted. We passed around the bottle, with most partaking a sip or two, except for Rusty (WHO doesn't trust his liquor) and Donkey (WHO used his wee little shot glass instead of sharing our lipspittle). Everyone was accounted for except WIPOS and OOzing. OOzing had been seen crossing the dunes, so he was nearby. WIPOS was last seen as we entered BR. WHO knows what he does to get where he gets to or when, but it wasn't unusual, so we called out before heading back on trail.<br/><br/>
The trail continued for another 10 minutes, going up and down the dunes, until the pack could clearly be heard calling, "False Trail!" Since they were so emphatic about it, especially the Tip, I was sure it was the Beer Stop at the top of the highest dune. I called out to have Rusty save a Captains Daughter for me, and received some bullshit reply. When I finally reached into the beer bag, I found a few flavors, and chose a Sierra Nevada Double Hopped IPA. Then I notice a few Captain's Daughters being enjoyed around the circle and was a little disappointed, until Rusty shared his with me. My appreciation was short lived as Rusty reached back into the bag and pulled out the "LAST" Captain's Daughter. AND if that wasn't enough, as we were about to leave the Beer Stop and start down the dunes (see pic), he pulled the really really last Captain's Daughter out of the tree behind me. As far as the beer selection, it went from good to great very quickly, and the question about Next Week pulling off a good Hash went dramatically and positively answered.<br/>WHO was happy

We had a good number of songs sung and enjoyed the beer and snacks. Some, not me, were wondering if WIPOS would ever be seen again. Beer mostly finished and as Rusty grabs that last can from the tree, we started back to the cars, but not before a photo was taken of our trek out.<br/>

We circled up at the cars and gave comments about the Hare's work tonight. Mostly good to not terrible, as I remember, with the rating averaged at negative .69. Then the Hare had his DownDown and sang his song. Next 3 Backsliders followed by the Visitor were invite in for questioning and DD's. The Visitor sang Pissonya and we finished the ditty with Pisshitcummonya. The discussion about Hashit was long and labored. WIPOS should have got it in absentia, as he was still out there somewhere. Rusty almost got it, as did OOzing and The Tird, but it fell on my shoulders and submit this Hash Trash. We then drove over to Dan's Place, where Captain's Daughter was on tap. Great Night, Great Beer, Good Times and not so terrible Hash Trail.<br/><br/>
Many are still wondering where WIPOS is/was. Rusty spoke to him from the pub and he was still out there somewhere. <a><image src="http://rih3.com/Images/wipostrail.jpg"> <a/> <br/>
But this is all he saw. No Beer, No Bourbon, No Orange Food, No Company.....NUTTIN but sand. Think he had a thought or twa about that jogger that had a heart attack and was found 10 years later identified by his backpack? Maybe that's why he wears so many layers. WHO knows... but he won't tell.<br/><a><image src="http://rih3.com/Images/whereiswipos.jpg"> <a/>
