<p>Canine Hounds: Shitty Trail, Seamus, and Mr. Peabody</p>

<p>Trail #1: Some 
people erected their tents in the back, some had a drink or three, and some 
probably did both. I heard that Friars dog, Shitty Trail, who is afraid of most 
other dogs, was even frightened of a porcelain statue of a pig? We got into some 
cars and drove over to the beginning of the trail, which was maybe technically 
in the town of Dennis, in the woods where high school kids go to drink.</p>

<p>The trail went 
along a path through the trees that became progressively narrower and more 
shiggified. There was a long stretch though a muddy section of this path w/ only 
thick brush and thorns on each side of a shallow, water-filled trench. At this 
point you had to decide if you preferred getting wet over getting bloody... how 
devious! I think this is good evidence that live haring under certain 
circumstances pales in comparison to pre-laying the trail; there's just no way 
the hares could have set this up w/ only a skull-start, unless it was like a 
whole hour, and then it wouldn't exactly be a live trail, would it? So it was 
only a matter of time until I had to turn left, give up and get wet. There was a 
flour mark next to a rusted little shack, and BC#1 was not far from this, at the 
edge of a small pond or bay. There were nice, powerful pink drinks pre-mixed in 
Vodka bottles, and a big rusted out car corpse.</p>

<p>Didn't seem like 
trail was too far between here and BC#2, but that didn't stop some of the bimbos 
from autohashing. This second stop was on top of a hill under some big power 
lines. I think they shoulda hung the beer from the stanchion pole things, b/c it 
was not waiting for us when we got there (boo!). The Beer eventually showed up 
inside of a car, and the bearers of suds plus two hashers in piggyback formation 
were pelted w/ snowballs as they ascended the hill. There was a meeting of the 
Crack House Harriers, and a pig pile rolling down the hill that involved 
MasterGator and no less than 3 harriettes.</p>

<p>Then it seemed 
like an even shorter distance from here back to where the cars were parked. Same 
as last year, the on-in was at a great little spot within walking distance of 
our home for the weekend... JZs bar!</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">On-In #1:</font> After some discussion, Oozing was 
appointed RA for the even- ing. We sang &quot;Green Leaves are Yellow&quot; to get 
everybody's attention. The hares were poked into the circle and here's some of 
the comments - &quot;Not enough horseshit&quot;, &quot;Scenery +6.9, logistics -6.9, =0!&quot;, 
Friar wrung his socks out over the hares craniums, &quot;1Pm sharp?&quot;, &quot;Where's the 
shiggy?&quot;, &quot;Too long&quot;, &quot;EXCELLENT!&quot;, &quot;Not long enough&quot;, &quot;Didn't get wet&quot;, 
&quot;Where's the sex?&quot;, &quot;Not enough anthrax and HAZMAT teams&quot;, &quot;Where's the beer?&quot; 
The hares sang &quot;Used to Work in Chicago&quot;, and then Puffy and Bo had to drink for 
wearing the same black GW-riding-a- rocket shirt. Two of the hares and Basket 
didn't get wet on trail, so they drank for shiggy avoidance. Oozing was having 
deja-vu, so he brought Cod in for advising those who just quaffed to beware of 
the lake after BC#1, and some more people wearing identical clothing had to 
drink. They sang a song with the lyrics &quot;Oh my darling... you tickle mine, Ill 
tickle yours&quot; which was a new one to me.</p>

<p>After The Slasher 
and Swallow down-downed for being over- achieving doctors, two virgins called 
Teresa (Denise's mom) and Denise were demented very rapidly - &quot;This is your 
down-down song, it is not very long&quot;. Some jerk wouldn't turn the jukebox down 
after we asked him nicely, so to see how drunk he was we invited him in for a 
quick comment. All he had to slur was &quot;If I'm getting initiated I wanna say 
'drink beers and have fun'&quot;. No shit, Einstein! That's like my entire philosophy 
of life, dude.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="Images/882_883/05_friarsbirthday.jpg" width="410" height="307"></p>

<p>The other RAs kept 
giving themselves down-down privileges (b/c Oozing was running out of stuff to 
say, and the big hoagies had arrived?), so we sang &quot;They're the Meanest&quot;. We 
were about to perform &quot;Swing Low&quot; when someone remembered Heather hadn't had a 
birthday down-down yet. It was agreed that the easiest way tos um up the 
afternoon was &quot;No sex, lots shiggy&quot;, so the hares&nbsp; drank, Oozing made 
himself drink one last time, and that was it!</p>

<p>Back at the ranch 
some more stuff happened, well, like drinking and watching past episodes of Sex 
in the City, but of course the REALLY interesting stuff didnt take place until 
much later, when all but 4 of us had gone off to Slumberland; of course Im re- 
ferring to Nude Scattergories and Midnight Baseball. Wow.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Two write-ups for the price of one! Im so very generous:</font></b></p>

<font color="#0000FF">On In:</font> Same as where we woke up<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hares:</font> Oozing and Muther Shucker<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Time: </font>Afternoon...<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Total Distance:</font> A smidge too long for a recovery run, but the fantastic shiggy made up for 
this<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Scribe:</font> One Drunk Walking<br>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Hounds:</font> Same as yesterday, excluding the &quot;justs&quot;, and V. Pelvis, C. Climber, M.

<p><font color="#0000FF">Canine hounds:</font> &quot;It shouldnt happen to a dog&quot;... in other words... ?</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Trail #2:</font> Oh snap, I cant really put a coherent 
picture of this trail together for you, although I did do a watercolor of the 
experience on Tues. night that looks great! Maybe we can have Hash Art Day 
sometime + share our creative endeavors? Worth a try...</p>

<p><img border="0" src="Images/882_883/15_sundayrun2.jpg" width="410" height="307"></p>

<p>It was muddy, it 
was wet, it was a glorious tribute to hashing at its most hard-core! Songs will 
be sung about this trail throughout the ages, I assure you. A prime contender 
for Best of '03, without a doubt! If you missed it, you might not have survived 
it (more than half of the trail had a Suction Factor of 6.9 or more), so maybe 
you're better off?</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">On In #2:</font> Basket was our RA, and he gave us a 
rousing and obscure (for Boston) song called &quot;Lobstermen Back from the Sea&quot;. The 
hares were shoved inward, and these were comments - &quot;Proved I was intelligent&quot;, 
&quot;Could it be wetter, please?&quot;, &quot;Sucked me down&quot;, &quot;Not enough shiggy, small sheep 
or goats&quot;, &quot;Almost enough shiggy&quot;, &quot;Gorgeous weather, scenery and people&quot;, &quot;I 
forgot what I was gonna say, but now Ill say it Tore the Roof off the Muther 
Shucker!&quot; - okay I gotta toot my own horn here, and once more at the end - I 
remember now that what I WANTED to say was &quot;Not enough Lyme disease&quot;, since a 
hasher (Torn Anus?) found a large tick on his arm (BC#2?). Can I help it if Im 
hilarious? You know you love it : ) Deep Throats comment was &quot;They're real, and 
they're spectacular - Im the Shiggy Messiah!&quot;. SPF called Oozing &quot;a belly belly 
bad mon&quot;.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="Images/882_883/22_rih3_incircle.jpg" width="410" height="307"></p>

<p>Hares did 
down-downs and Muther Shucker was &quot;Beat by a Paki&quot;. They did the &quot;I don't want 
to go to war&quot; song (nice!). The Virgins entered, and all fell silent. Cum Chowda 
demented them while wearing his little red Satan horns. Ty likes doggy style and 
Shirley said &quot;There is no square root of 69&quot; (Ty said &quot;its irrational&quot;). Here's 
to them! Friar was caught avoiding the delicious, nutritious shiggy this time, 
so he teabagged w/ an assist from SLTA.&nbsp; Basket proceeded to insert a 
tennis ball into his rectum. EverReady told yesterday's hares &quot;We need to talk&quot; 
(uh oh...), and then they sand &quot;Rhode Island Red&quot;. The circle ended right about 
when Oozing was pushing Swallow in a wheelbarrow, it tipped over and she spilled 
his beer.</p>

<p>&quot;He (Enos?) put his scrotum on the back of my neck while he was wearing a tutu, for Chrissake!&quot; 
- Puff n Stuff</p>
<p>&quot;Loggerhead trail is just ahead... that is Lager and Head&quot; ?</p>
<p>&quot;The Shawkanaw (get it? Shock and Awe??) indians must've set this trail&quot; ??</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, can I borrow your thermometer?&quot; Me pointing to Swallows harmonica</p>
<p>&quot;Watch your hole!&quot; Everybody</p>
<p>&quot;Where does that (F U you Fin F!) come from?&quot;(Stuff Me)&quot;From the Heart!&quot; (Bo)</p>
