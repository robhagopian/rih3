<p><font color="#008000">Run #1113</font>, July 30, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Sneech Pond, off Mendon Rd, Cumberland</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 80’s, partly cloudy (with scattered showers, none of which arrived in 
time to obscure marks or at least provide some relief from the heat, for cryin’ out loud!)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Bondo Jovi, Eenie Weenie Dick, Basket Boom Boom, Oozing SD, Seamus, 
Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hare had forgotten that he was on for this week’s hash, until he got a voice mail from <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> Sunday evening. (Thus, with no time to think, he laid a better trail than any of his more prepared recent hashes. 
Thinking, of course, is more of a euphemism than an actual process for this hare.) At 6:15 he emerged from the woods, and 
came into the parking lot at the start. He had thistle rash and mud on his legs, scratches on his arms. He applied more 
bug repellant, and whined about the sting as he sprayed. It was starting to look good. But looks can be deceiving. He 
looked at the poor attendance, and stuffed a few beers and some ice into his knapsack. Not many beers. Not a good sign. He 
borrowed some flour from <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>. Not a good sign, either.</p>

<p>The “pack” was off at 6:30. At this point, it consisted of <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. And the always annoying Ben. Trail led  northeast up Staples Road. The 
first check had <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> turning left and uphill on the 
powerline trail. After a quarter mile with two marks they turned back. Boy, did the hare get them! Ha Ha! Back on 
pavement, they continued uphill, to catch the FRB <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Another check had <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> trying right, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> 
continuing straight and the hare chatting up a suburban housewife. Ultimately, they bowed to the inevitable, and turned 
left and uphill to the water tower.</p>

<p>Now trail was fairly simple and meandered with a few meaningless checks northwest on motorbike/ATV paths. Many marks 
were torn up by tire tracks. But with no difficulty <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> pressed on until he found a “WN”, 
and then in an opening on the gas pipeline, a “W”. Knowing the alcohol-dependent nature of the hare, he waited. <font 
color="#FF0000">EWD</font> arrived. The hare arrived, and broke out some bourbon in a flask. Noting the sweatiness of the 
pack, he offered a beer which was accepted. But then Basket arrived. It was only with some difficulty that the pack could 
restrain <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> usual tale of short-cutting, shiggy-tracking, etc.  Too late! <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> arrived. The hare started to whine about there not being enough beer at the BC. 
Understandable, given the huge pack size of FOUR WHOLE HASHERS!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> decided that this meant that he had better not be last to the BC, so he started 
out. Trail led pretty much northwest on the pipeline. There was a wee bit of mud. But it was very easy to avoid.  Trail 
turned west onto West Wrentham Rd. where a check led <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> 
southwest. A brief falsie on Westgate had <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> at the back of the pack again. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> led south into an infamous orchard where in the past, 
shotguns had greeted the hashers. This time, all was well, even for <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and even <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> who stopped to chat with the owners by the time 
he got there. Do property owners have no self-respect these days? Allowing hooligans, dogs and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> onto their property? A sad commentary on the plight of the farmer in RI that they are too insecure to let some 
rock-salt blast at trespassers! But I digress.</p>

<p>At the back of the farm, they re-entered the woods at the powerline trail. This was overgrown with thistles and briars, 
but by the time the back of the pack made it through, the effects of the hare setting and <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> following the trail had cleared a nice path. Southeast on the powerline, the 
hare called back the pack, to turn into the woods to the left. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> in front, ignored this 
for a while. To his chagrin. The hare led <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> (with the 
liberal reapplication of <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> flour) parallel to the lines. Soon, he lost his own trail, 
explaining that he had run out of flour and had had to use chalk. Chalk on rocks, specifically. Works well for 
bushwhacking through dense underbrush with NO VISIBLE ROCKS whatsoever.</p>

<p>Finally, the hare led them to the powerline road, where there was a “B”. And a parked truck belonging to some fishermen 
at the shore who did not appreciate Ben. Well, neither do we! The limited beer supplies were divied up. Three beers for 
the hare, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>. 
Brilliant! Especially when <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> finally arrived. No wonder there was no singing this night. 
Their throats were too parched! Luckily for everyone, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> never made it.</p>

<p>Trail out led back to Staples Rd. and to the cars. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> car was there, so brief 
consideration was given to waiting. But they decided that with luck they could get away without seeing him at all this 
night, so they started the circle. Ratings for the run: not enough shiggy, not enough beer, no bimbos, recycled territory 
and no gunfire. It seemed conclusive until <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> let loose with an astounding 15 “F” rating! 
This brought the total to <b>-0.69</b>! Hashit was this close to remaining with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> until 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> arrived. He claimed to have run the entire trail. Ha! Reason enough for hashit!</p>

<p>Finishing up, they went to Tucks, minus <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (who needed a wank) and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> (who will soon be renamed <font color="#FF0000">P.W. Oozing S.D.</font>, unless he either 
gives his new girlfriend a rest, or brings her to the hash). The usual waitress was on vacation, so they remained subdued. 
About the only thing of note for the entire evening was the masterful summing up by Seamus, the Grand Master. Just before 
everyone left for the night, Seamus left his master, crossed the entire parking lot over to the hare’s car and spent 
several minutes releasing a huge quantity of urine on the hare’s left front tire. There was even enough to trickle 25 
yards downhill to hit both his masters’s car and beyond to <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> car. I think that says 
it all.</p>
