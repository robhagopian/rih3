out to the main trail, and then south to the dam of Tillinghast Pond. The hare 
returned to his car and brought the beer for the circle back down. The trail was 
rated. This was a tough one. Good shiggy, no pavement, short trail (no laundry 
need be done, this week!), and a virgin bimbo were powerful arguments. But,<FONT

name <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Pat</FONT>. Good luck on that one, 
wanks!&nbsp;Hashit went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>, <FONT

than happy to donate his plastic toy to the already overflowing pouch. On On On 
was at Oakhill Tavern. The virgin promised to return soon (although she did 
mention something about her frequent trips to pick people up at the 
airport.)<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
