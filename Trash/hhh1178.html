<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">For the virgin 
hares (for Rhode Island, anyways) a large crowd was sure to show. Conveniently 
located in the upper parking lot of The Marieville School in North Providence, 
the hash gathered with visitors from Boston. The Woonsocket crowd of bimbos had 
figured on this being a Halloween run, Oct 27 and all, and showed up in bizarre 
costumes. Then again, maybe that’s how they dress in Woonsocket. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> had no comment. They watched as the hare and co-hare 
showed up at just about 6:20. Trail was started on time. Too bad for <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Laa-Laa</FONT>, late again!<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = 
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The obvious 
beginning was just that: around the parking lot fence and north on the 
powerlines. It was all flashlights at this point of the year. The powerlines had 
a few checks which fooled no one as there was nowhere else to go until they came 
to Rt. 246. After some confusion, trail was found entering a neighborhood 
briefly. But it still continued north. And back to the powerlines. 
Whoopee!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They continued 
to parallel Rt 146 north, up Cobble hill. Diverging from the powerlines, they 
crossed Cobble Hill Rd. Trail briefly entered the Lincoln Woods. This led to 
some attempts at shortcutting. But <FONT color=#ff0000>Red Tipped Shark</FONT> 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>, having no idea where they were, were 
able to find true trail leading almost to the pond, and crossing under the 
highway in a tunnel. The rest soon followed.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail crossed 
246 again, and headed into Twin Rivers. A beer check at the slots? No chance! 
The almost invisible marks were followed along the south border of the parking 
lot until finally, someone saw a light in the woods. It was the hare at the beer 
check. On the powerlines! The beer came out and the singing started, muted only 
when the security van could be seen through the bushes. Against all odds, even 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Pat My Fly</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT> 
made it eventually. And <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! It was time to 
leave.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail back took 
the powerlines southeast, across Paddock Dr to 246. They turned south on 246 and 
encountered a completely unnecessary loop through some shiggy between the two 
highways. What fun! Eventually, they caught on and crossed under 146 and took 
Cooper to Bassett to the school. As they prepared to circle, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Laa-Laa</FONT> showed up with a tale of lost trail, North 
Providence Police and sexual favors from woodland creatures or something. It was 
a long time ago, so maybe I’ve got it wrong. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
cares. They circled up near the powerlines.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Ratings for the 
run: virgin hares, virgin territory, and some shiggy were positives. But <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> at the beer 
check, miles of pavement, and dry feet were powerful negatives. Total:-0. The 
visitors were interrogated and punished. Hashit went to Basket for boasting 
about finding better trail than anyone (i.e. getting lost, AGAIN!). And, 
finishing up, they headed for The Lodge, where the food missiles were plentiful, 
and the back room was soon emptied by the group. But they never seem to kick us 
out, so I guess we have to keep going back.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
