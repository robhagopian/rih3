<p><font color="#0000ff">The 
Run:<br> </font><font color="#000000">A lovely 
spring day. A pert and comely hare, minus her annoying and flatulent POSSLQ (at 
least till the end). What more could be asked for in a spring hash (other than 
of course, the loss of <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>)? So with light hearts the RIH3 set off on <font color="#ff0000">Swamp Whine's</font> inaugural haring, from the parking lot of her 
new digs just across the river from <font color="#ff0000">Little Neck's</font>         
              
                
              
               
old place, in Cumberland.<br><br>Trail 
crossed the river west on the footbridge and immediately turned south along the 
tow path. If not virgin territory, at least it was a pleasant jog down memory 
lane, and the group spread out somewhat based upon their varying interests in 
actual running. (This&nbsp; is a nice way of saying <font color="#ff0000">Just 
Haynes</font> took off like a Jackrabbit, and <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>        
             
               
             
           wheezed along, 
swearing mightily in the rear.) A few checks led to no interesting shiggy 
whatsoever; sadly, there would be no crossing of stagnant canal water this day. 
Eventually,&nbsp;a check&nbsp;led to Martin Street, and true trail was found 
west and then north.<br><br>Trail was briefly on road. It soon turned into the woods, 
and some confusion led to the splitting of the pack. <font color="#ff0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> were slightly more 
confused than the rest of the pack. So, while <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>, 
<font color="#ff0000">Just Haynes</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Scatwoman</font> 
forged ahead, the slacker crowd discovered the hare, and the BEER! Their charm 
and impish humor worked on the hare, and they were able to stage an impromptu 
Beer Check on a unmarked side trail. <font color="#ff0000">Just Haynes</font> was 
smart enough to double back, and even <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font>          
               
              
             
                
              
     eventually caught on, but the rest were grimly and 
dry-ly carrying on north.<br><br>The group finally rejoined as they 
returned to the Rt 116 bridge, and recrossed the river. The hare was slightly 
confused, especially when <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font> arrived and tried 
to assert himself. After a bit of milling about, they finally decided to just 
get to the circle and get it over with. So the group was led to the southern 
extent of the condo parking lot and into some woods for a circle. Ratings for 
the run: No virgin territory, but some shiggy. No river crossings, but no <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font> till the end.&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi 
<font color="#000000">DID</font> </font>appear at the end, but we must 
encourage&nbsp;our few&nbsp;bimbos. Total: +0.69! Hashit? <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>        
             
             
               
                
               
            
          
 , of course, for missing the BC and then starting to give a long 
and annoying explanation for why he chose to get lost yet again and how his 
trail was so much better than the actual trail, etc. etc.<br><br>After finishing up, the group was 
invited up to the new condo for a visit. The hash was impressed, but mainly 
because <font color="#ff0000">Fuwangi</font>  
                
     had forgot to hide the quality stuff. Once 
the single malt was gone, they proceeded to Tucks and the usual conclusion to the 
evening was enjoyed.</p>
