It was 6:30 on a Monday<br/>
RIH3 was running for beer.<br/>
OOzing was our hare tonight<br/>
Along with a mystery Hare.<br/><br/>

Turns out it was Bung Hole<br/>
WHO was last seen years ago.<br/>
She quietly says don't blame me<br/>
This trail is a real shit-show.<br/>
La la la la di da<br/>
La la la di da da da<br/><br/>

OOzing points off to the woods<br/>
Just behind the store.<br/>
"You'll find flour if you look for it<br/>
This trail has shiggy and more."<br/><br/>

Now the pack runs around the fencing<br/>
Into poison ivy and trash<br/>
Flour was sparse and he knew <br/>
Cum mid-week we'd all have a rash.<br/>
La la la la di da<br/>
La la la di da da da<br/><br/>

Now WHO led us for a while,<br/>
Then Crabby took us to a wall<br/>
I got lost in a trash heap<br/>
And the pack found no flour at all.<br/><br/>

OOzing pointed a short-cut<br/>
Along the Plainfield Pike<br/>
Flour led us behind the pharmacy<br/>
Into a watery dike.<br/>
La la la la di da<br/>
La la la di da da da<br/><br/>

Here we found us some liquid<br/>
That caused us all to cheer.<br/>
Snacks of some kind of yellow food<br/>
And there was plenty of beer.<br/><br/>

We sang us a song of merriment<br/>
Sexual innuendo lyrics were clear<br/>
Despite all the urging and hormone surging<br/>
We were happy the end was so near.<br/>
La la la la di da<br/>
La la la di da da da<br/><br/>

This is the end of my story<br/>
There isnt much more to say.<br/>
Bung Hole won't be back again.<br/>
She's moving far, far away.<br/><br/>

Lucky for her and her new boy<br/>
Not so for the rest of the Hash.<br/>
OOzing will be the Hare again.<br/>
I hope then we'll be cured of this rash.<br/>
La la la la di da<br/>
La la la di da da da<br/><br/>
