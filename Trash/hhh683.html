because I was drinking good beer instead) Spontaneous Virgins at the circle: 
Oozing's neighbors - Liz and Oozing's orthopedic doctor (name forgotten by YHS, 
who was into double digit beers)</font></a></P><a name="Write-up"><font face="Arial"><BR></font></a><A name=w_4>
<H3><font face="Arial" size="3">The Start, the run and beer check</font> </H3>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">We started the run closer to 3 p.m. .. which gave ample time for those who 
had attempted to follow the incorrect directions from Boston to find the State 
Capitol. It was a fine sunny afternoon in Providence. We, in varying shades of 
red, assembled in a parking lot across the street from the State Capitol. Basket 
blew his horn and we circled up. Rodent Feltcher had a very well accessorized 
red prom dress ... a pink handbag and belt, plus black high-heeled sandals, 
which he had to change for running shoes prior to the start. Friar F was wearing 
an ensemble that was more fuchsia than red. Fudgesuckle, in a lovely new red 
dress with black sequins, drove to the start in an open Jeep, full of guys in 
red dresses (must have made quite an impression on 95). A gay pride rally was 
taking place in Providence, and most passersby assumed we were somehow connected 
with the rally.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">We ran around through the new part of Providence with a water feature plus 
little row boats (it didn't used to be there, but what the hey). The tourists 
loved us. We ran around downtown, past two street fairs, and on up into 
venerable Brown University. You can tell this is liberal academia, as most folks 
were very interested in who we were, and why we were doing it (we should have 
had hand-outs, the constant explanations slowed me down). Somewhere on the way 
up the hill, we lost 3 Boston hashers and 3 Newport Hashers. They never made it 
to the beer check and were late to the on-in (do not cry for them, they stayed 
at a street fair, danced to live music and hopefully found a few beers). The run 
had multiple checks and occasional lapses in mark setting ... most, but not all, 
found the way to the beer check, which was on an old abandoned RR trestle (over 
water, with no handrails, and a few missing links in the bridge). NOPE ... the 
phobics (or the sane), opted to stay on land and forego the beer. However, the 
Hash is not without a heart ... several of those who were undeterred by the 
over-water less than stable bridge opted to bring back beer to the phobics 
(Rodent Feltcher also brought us a loaf of bread). Never say Hashers don't 
care!</font></P></a><A name=w_5>
<H3><font face="Arial" size="3">After the beer check to the on-in, whatever</font></H3>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, after the beer check ... the trail hit major league shiggy and a tunnel 
under roads that had no lights whatsoever. Some opted for the alterna-trail. The 
trail went into Brown's athletic fields, but only if one was able to use the 
pallet which was placed against a 6 foot wall/fence combo. Some hashers decided 
to run around. Depending on which side one chose, one would be hopelessly lost 
without trail. Fortunately, all one needed to do is ask any local the question: 
"Excuse me, have you seen a bunch of odd folks run by wearing red dresses? ... I 
am trying to find them." I found the on-in that way (but still had to explain 
hashing to at least 3 bunches of Sunday fun folks in Providence).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, so, after stuffing ourselves with food prepared by Bondo and who knows 
who else (thank you, it was quite good!!), and drinking a sh*t-load of beer from 
the Trinity Brew Pub (we had kegs, yahoo!), the 6 lost hashers finally wormed 
their way back to the on-in. We had a circle. Abused the hares, as usual. Basket 
probably removed his dress (but, as he always takes his clothes off, I would not 
have noticed). We invited visitors into the circle (from other than RI, Newport 
and Boston). We accused folks of various offenses etc.</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">There was the naming of two Boston Hashers - Ally got named Hairless Fish Nut 
Jeff got named Cabana Boy. Hey, I only report what happened !!!</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">Then, a couple of Oozing's neighbors attempted to park in the lot and go 
inside. They became unwitting spontaneous virgins at the circle: Liz and 
Oozing's orthopedic doctor (whose name was immediately forgotten by YHS, the 
"name-challenged"). The neighbors were good sports and did their down down with 
ease.</font></P></a><A name=w_6>
<H3><font face="Arial" size="3">Comment of the afternoon</font></H3>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">"I own more red dresses than suits" - one of the male harriers (to which two 
other harriers responded that this was the same situation for them). Other 
comment heard regarding difficulty in finding an appropriate red dress: "I may 
look ridiculous, but I don't want to look bad!"</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">--- CA (delinquent Boston Scribe ... just shut up and give me a down down,
dammit)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="2">P.S. --- being a complete bozo with names (unless I take notes), I asked 
Shine On for help. Here is a NEWS FLASH: While trimming trees Sunday, her ladder 
fell. She fell on the ladder, and broke her right arm!!! All hashers may sign 
Shin On's cast at Sunday's Blue Hills hash.</font></P>
