<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was a cold, snowing, wind blown evening for
a hash. With a few inches of the white shiggy on the ground already, it
was evident that this was going to be an interesting hash, if not glorious
event. The few hounds that braved the storm and met at the Landmark Rehab
Hospital on 146A in Woonsocket were </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Beyond
Hope, Oozing Syphilitic Dick-d-phone</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">, and
co-hare </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
The hare </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and
Grand Master </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Jake</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
found comfort in their warm abode and left the elements to those less fortunate
half brains that would be better served by checking into the Rehab Hospital
for psychiatric evaluation, than hashing though this winter wonderland.
It was Mother Natures little April Fools joke, and just one week before
daylight savings begins.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Beyond Hope</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> suggested
we head directly over to the local pub, and save the trail for a more gentile
evening in a pathetic last ditch effort to avoid the inevitable. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
would not even consider it, especially since </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
was already warming up for his first Snow Hash since leaving the Himalayas
and going off to Medical School. To appease </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">B.H</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.,
the original trail, with markings long since lost to sight, would be the
AGM trail in just a few weeks, and a live trail would have to be blazed
in the snow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The small pack started out along the old trolley
bed, behind the hospital, which brought the trio out to the Park Square
intersection. Dodging snow plows, and other emergency vehicles, the pack
made it’s way across the highway, around the Super Stop and Shop to a trail
into a dense swamp. The snow laden branches created a tunnel effect and
caused the hounds to follow trail in a crouched position. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was a serene setting, with boughs bending over,
sometime obscuring an obvious trail, which led out to the power line. Turning
right, the trail followed down hill into a knee deep swamp and up again
to another set of lines. Checking right and left, the pack found flour
uphill again, and continued for about a half mile as the crackling lines
overhead sparked and crackled in reminding us of our frail mortal being.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We crossed a trash heap, over the highway, and
up another power line into a blinding white-out storm. With nothing to
stop the frozen granular from peppering our eyes except our snow covered
gloves, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Beyond Hope</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and I gradually made it to the top of a hill. Looking for our missing Sherpa,
we saw a faint shadow of a man making his way through the blizzard. We
found out later, that wearing glasses in the wind whipped snow made </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ooooozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
almost blind, and he had to feel the snow for our foot prints. Eventually
we made it to the old trolley bed now a raging slush river, and back into
the parking lot.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A triangle was formed and the hare made to stand
on the line for his down-down. Other sins were confronted and swift justice
was made. The plow operator asked us politely to move of asses so he could
continue his work, so the pack made its way over to Box Seats. It was closed,
so we headed over to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s.
Turkey sandwiches (no, not </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
on toast), beer and jelly beans were enjoyed by all (including </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ms.
Jovi</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">) and we picked out Easter egg surprises.
Before heading home in what was now 10 plus inches...just like me, we decided
to give down-downs, next week, those who didn't dare.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hashit: </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ms. Jovi</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">...she
won it in the egg along with 2 down-downs. </FONT></P>
