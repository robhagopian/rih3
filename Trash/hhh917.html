<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> low 40's, Clear<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present: </font><font color="#FF0000">Async, Dr WHO, Oozing SD, SESYB, WIPOS, Tinker, Basket Boom

<font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font face="arial" size="2">Can't even call it a circle really. Along the 
river NW from Cold Spring Park to the Singleton St Bridge, crossing the river 
and Canal street, up through a few bushes (the only shiggy for the run, 
pathetic!) to the RR tracks. Loss of all marks (a <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
moment)at this point did not deter anyone (except <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, 
who spent the rest of the evening looking for shiggy and he-man hoboes along the 
rails), as they continued NW over St Paul Street and the river, turning west 
along the on in trail on Main street (another Bondo moment) to a Tupperware 
factory or something complete with savage guard dog, then dipping back south 
down a stairway and a leaf and scree covered hill to the river bank.
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>were 
frightened by the pooch, so they shortcutted, the rest followed the dirt road 
along the river looping west then north to the gorge and the BC, where all 
except <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> gathered and drank and sang. [Except
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was so worried that <font color="#FF0000">
SESYB</font> had met some crazy Frenchie from Woonsocket with more generous 
masculine equipment that he couldn't enjoy his beer and he paced around 
hollering &quot;On On!&quot; and blowing his whistle and finally decided to backtrack and 
find her even knowing that this meant hashit for sure but I digress.]<br>
On In led to the Blackstone Gorge, then turned east on County to Main, and then 
Main Street all the way back to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> for like 
seven straight miles or something, all pavement, no shiggy, no bimbos, no leash 
for Ben and he still didn't get killed. Sheesh!<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Ratings:</font> 69! for a nearly perfect f*ck up.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Hashit:</font> Oozing, no Tinker, no Basket!<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">On On On:</font> Where else but upstairs with Bondo Beer 
and Chili for that satisfying bowel cleansing combo that keeps us all coming 
back for more.</font></p>
