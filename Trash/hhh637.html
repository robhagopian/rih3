Hanson's Landing, Naragansett</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>It started in typical Sagittarius style…15 minutes late, but with class.&nbsp;
As
<BR>the crowd stumbled out of Hanson’s landing and gathered together on
the last
<BR>bit of dry land the group would see for tree hours, a small swamp monster
<BR>trudged across the road to join us…but no wait…that looks like BasketBB.
<BR>Wetter than any woman he's ever been with, he mumbled something about
losing
<BR>Tinker virginity in Salt Pond with the canoe.&nbsp; And so marks the
beginning of
<BR>the wettest run of the year, even for RIH3.&nbsp; Cheap Licker picked
up tree
<BR>virgins in the parking lot…they were enamored by her voluptuous body…that’s
<BR>her story …and after some not so formal intros and songs, we were on
our
<BR>way.&nbsp; With miraculous ingenuity, they made it through the first
circle jerk
<BR>without getting lost…and on the first attempt!&nbsp; It took the hares
three
<BR>times while presetting…oops.&nbsp; So there we were on the road again.
<BR>Fantastic, incredible, mother f*@%ing ostriches on the true trail,
oh it was
<BR>a sight for sore eyes as we stormed through a quiet neighborhood, riling
up
<BR>all the dogs and inbreeds of Narragansett.&nbsp; As the road ended
there were
<BR>faces of concern as we headed south along the shoreline…yes, that would
be
<BR>the last pavement they saw until dark.&nbsp; A half mile later through
tall,
<BR>salty reeds, muck, slime and water, we came upon trailer park heaven…or
what
<BR>some may refer to as a campsight.&nbsp; Thousands of crappy little
trailers for
<BR>as far as the eye could see.&nbsp; Fortunately, Free Willy restrained
from
<BR>uprooting any plants along the way…Oh, shit, where are the virgins??&nbsp;
The
<BR>campers looked on with fear and hid as a dozen and a half slimy, stinkin’
<BR>hashers trudged their way along the trail…children were swept up, doors
were
<BR>locked…as the innocent heard the almighty horn announcing the arrival
of
<BR>RIH3.&nbsp; The Voluptuous Hare patiently waited for the virgins to
end their
<BR>masterbating in the tall reeds and they finally emerged….explaining
that
<BR>they had to go around the tree foot crossing so as not to get wet.&nbsp;
Another
<BR>half mile or so we were done shocking the campers and made our way
a bit
<BR>west…yes, back to the lovely swamp…over the woods and through the briars
and
<BR>barbed wire, the wankers were whining, oh yes.&nbsp; Oozing was anxiously
<BR>clutching his blow up doll…I mean floaty thingy…in fear of drowning,
but he
<BR>was safe because CL was nowhere in sight.&nbsp; The wankers avoided
a bit of the
<BR>water and made their way through the stinging, salty reeds, being the
<BR>masochists they are.&nbsp; And then there was BEER, and then we fucked,
and Free
<BR>Willy uprooted some reeds…it lasted for hours it seemed as we again
waited
<BR>for the virgins….only one came.&nbsp; Through the weeds he appeared,
salivating
<BR>for the beer that was just across the inlet…was he a swimmer or a
<BR>whacker…turns out he's a virgin whacker.&nbsp; Halfway through his
first beer, he
<BR>claimed he hadn't had enough, so on we trudged.&nbsp; Again the wankers
attempted
<BR>a trail on dry land but were warned they would be lost forever, so
Granola
<BR>took the lead into the muck and slime of the low tide of Salt Pond.&nbsp;
Mmmmmm,
<BR>yes!!&nbsp; The others followed, except for Oozing who attempted suicide
as he
<BR>went off “trail” into the deeper parts of the pond.&nbsp; Doo toilet
seats
<BR>float???&nbsp; Persuaded to follow the pack he survived the crossing
onto the
<BR>deserted island where we created another beer stop.&nbsp; BushYaaker,
being the
<BR>Newport Hasher that he is, abused his Scotch Ale by getting salt water
in
<BR>it…and then had the balls to pick up another beer.&nbsp; Busting through
a couple
<BR>of circle jerks, Bondo led the pack, ignoring the tips from the hares
to go
<BR>straight, not right.&nbsp; After 20 “fucks” he made it back to flour
and we were
<BR>heading over to Harbor Island.&nbsp; But not to CL’s house…no.&nbsp;
Lets make them
<BR>swim to a reef in the middle of the Harbor for a down-down…at near
high
<BR>tide.&nbsp; The fools followed trail along more swampy waters to a
point about 25
<BR>yards from dry land…”so as not to embarrass the neighbors” the short
hare
<BR>said.&nbsp; So there we were.&nbsp; Tinker rejoined us after breaking
into CL’s house
<BR>for the beer…stupid bimbo locked up the down down tank in her house.&nbsp;
There
<BR>was singing and rejoicing and no, Oozing did not drown.&nbsp; So yes
folks, if
<BR>you did not cum, you missed a fourteen fuck run in the swamps of
<BR>Narragansett, eloquently described by none other than Bondo.&nbsp;
Of course the
<BR>on-on was fantastic, incredible…catered by CL Enterprises.&nbsp; The
virgins
<BR>were recovered in the parking lot and rejoined the crew at the
<BR>on-on-on…claiming they would cum again…that’s their story.
