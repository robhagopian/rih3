<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF">The Run:
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the threat of a storm brewing, the faithful
RIH3 met at Parente's, and with d'erections from the hare, set off down 7North
to the first check outside Bryant College.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;The trail led across the road into Fidelity
property. If <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was here, he would have had
Fleet acquire this co. too! On trail and a couple of more checks and onto the
power lines! Here, with all His might the fireworks were leashed upon the hash
and if only the hash world had prayed hard enough 2/3rd of the RIH3 could have
been fried but with one bolt! But bravely the hash ran on, following <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
just as the faithful followed Moses at the parting of the water...with the skies
alight with loud and mischeivous crackle!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The trail soon veered away from the lines across
a grazing field. Here <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> fell as if struck by
lightening, but woke soon to realize the pack kept running towards
beer.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, who had come to check,
was only after the horn (since the Newport hash stole his!). Across a road and
unto the BC which was under the bridge that gave a brief respite from the storm.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Good beer and bad singing was consumed with
unequal eagerness as the K9s wallowed in the stream. Beer consumed, the pack
alighted on the other side of the road and across another field and navigated a
check to...the cars!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The circle was behind Parente's where the pack
enjoyed the fair smell of the sewer having survived <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font>
farts not 5 mins earlier at the BC. Down downs to the hare, the hashit <font color="#FF0000">(BONDO)</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">DrWHO </font>proclaiming the title of official yuppie
of RIH3 in the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. The&nbsp; ONON was
at Parente's. Having been thrown out of this establishment twice before, the
hash was on customary good behaviour with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
turning on the accent in a feeble attempt to flirt with the waitress, Trail
spitting water, and everyone stealing each other's beer!&nbsp;&nbsp; Expensive
food and good beer was enjoyed by all...</font></p>
