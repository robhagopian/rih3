The location of the start was a bit hard to find, but diligence pays off eventually, and having arrived early did offer an insight to what may be. There was no lights on the St Stephen's Rectory, but you could tell it was a religious building. The steeple, the grave yard behind and a smallish parking lot at about the distance from Attleboro in the directions given by the Hare. As one looked across the graveyard, it was easy to wonder if we may be running through the stones and pathways, but with no one else there I continued to search for the parking area, having forgotten to write down the directions.<br><br>

The start was across the street by the athletic fields, and WHO, Hairy and I were the first to arrive. The Hare was no where in sight, but a beer was offered by Hairy and I accepted. It was cool and refreshing, but being so early, I felt alone and a shiver rushed through my body as I looked at the two other Hashers. I felt vounerable and alone until the Hashers arrived car by car. Pussy, Crotchy, the Irish lad, LB and Rusty joined our prelub followed by the remainder of the pack. The Hare arrived soon after, having secured the beer stop, and we were soon standing in a circle discussing the logistics and particulars of what we may find on trail and beyond. <br><br>

After some small talk in the cool air, the directions were given and we started out across the parking lot in the direction of the ball fields  There was a dark wooded section off to the right along the rail road track,and it here that we saw the last of Shemale. Most of us either skirted the fence or jumped over and across the field, just as a train passed by. Wondering for a moment if we might hear the thud of a body being tossed in the night, we would later find Shemale at the beer stop and our hopes erased.<br><br>

The trail was poorly marked, but someone found flour on the bank and up the stairs to the street. Another mark was located on the opposite side and we followed trail out to the sandpits off Tiffany Street and thence to a small pond. Marks were elusive and it took the help of many to find trail through the maze of small paths along the 10 mile river. Eventually most of us found ourselves just beyond the graveyard. Hairy originally passed by the beer and on the paved roads between the graves. Realizing his mistake, he turned quickly and ran directly into on of the concrete crypts at the end of the graveyard proper.<br><br>

Beer was enjoyed by all who found the location, and songs were begun as more and more made their way in. OOzing arrived just before Shemale and with that there was much complaining. Poor marks and choice of the company filled the air between versus of Hash ditties and bullshit. When the beer was finished, we crossed the graveyard to our cars across the street.<br><br>

A circle was formed in an area between the sport fields and the tracks just beyond a small burm of dirt. The Hare received his just desert. The Irish lad and other DD's were given to the guilty and more singing and drinking was enjoyed by all. The run was rated a positive .69 and OOzing was awarded Hashit for spending too much quality time with Shemale. before making our way to Wetherlaines for food and drink.<br><br>
