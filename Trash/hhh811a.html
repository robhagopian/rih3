<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#3333FF"><i>The Run:</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;<font size="2">Our own Pooh 
Bear <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO Slasher</font> (where did this Slasher thing 
come from anyway? Anybody know or did he give himself a bikers moniker to gain 
respect?), anyway I degress. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> chose a virgin 
terrain for this hash, and it was virgin for good reasons. Why anyone would want 
to bring such an upright group of athletes to the sewers of Seekonk is anybody’s 
guess. Not enough woods to make it entertaining, too much pavement to make it 
painful, even Mr. Shortcut <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> decided along 
with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, that it would be better to stay at home 
and cuddle with the wife in front of a warm fire, sipping mulled cider and 
licking whipped cream off each others … sorry I got carried away again.&nbsp; Back to 
the hash..</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">When I arrived a the 
local fitness center behind the famous Grist Mill off Rte 114 north, not south 
towards Barrington, a motley crew of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, WIPOS, PU
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Zoe</font> were standing by the hare wondering 
if anyone of substance would show in this hollow of a cesspool.&nbsp; I thought at 
first they were waiting for me and Baxter to arrive, but then I realized that 
without <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to lead the troops out of the park, 
they were hesitant to begin the fiasco. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">As it was getting on 10 
minutes past our appointed start time, it was apparent that the previously 
mentioned sex crazed fools and our own little darling of Rhode Island Eager 
Beaver 9, would not be joining us. The hare reluctantly pointed us off towards 
to road and eventual disappointment. I, having called <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> at his love nest to insure he would not be late arriving and miss 
this unfortunate event, left after the initial thrust of the pack, leaving not 
only a billowing of dust from their galloping shoes, but my flashlight behind in 
the jeep. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">I caught the pack as it 
rounded 114 south towards…can you guess?, and followed the smell into the woods. 
I was pretty confident I could maneuver through the trails, even though there 
was no moon and I only have one good eye, because of my heightened awareness of 
self and my surroundings. Along with the specialized nose of my faithful friend 
we were soon scampering along, first catching the laggards, and then passing 
their putrid bodies as they meandered along. I came to a small lake where a 
waterfall invited me across the rushing water. Baxter was at first unsure of 
it’s rushing water, thunderous billow, and slick footing. That plus crossing as 
such a great height gave him concern, but eventually followed me. The pack 
meanwhile searched miserably for an easier, drier, safer crossing to no avail, 
and eventually followed the sure-footed and swift Basket and Baxter over dam and 
onto a short trail along water's edge.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The hare in his cute 
‘trying to be cunning’ way, left small amounts of flour under freshly fallen 
leaves, in an attempt to make a short trail longer, but with my trusty Saint, we 
smoked out every sad attempt. Eventually we made our way out to the road way, 
which was inevitable given the limited off road terrain, and continued leading 
the pack until a length of trail had been erased by passing motorist. I was soon 
heading off in the wrong direction.&nbsp; I was not alone, however as the pack had 
also missed the mark. The hare in his despair to end our suffering led us back 
to trail and eventually the beer. We crossed a beautiful wooded area, complete 
with rope swing for our entertainment, but no beer would be found here. It 
wasn’t until we arrived at the sewer drainage ditch into what could have been a 
pristine pond when native Americans roamed freely among the pine and oak, that 
we found the elusive beer. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">As we held our noses 
and we swizzled some brew, which was evidently purchased at the discount, out of 
date liquor store, Zoë decided to see if she could walk across the scum-covered 
water. She was only able to get a few feet in when the weight of her anemic 
body, someone should feed this poor dog, slipped beneath the foam, stirring up a 
strong odor, which prompted all to caution <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> 
not to light up the cigar until the wind blew the volatile gasses away. We 
finished our beer, and continued on out, but not until Zoe brought the backwater 
spillage to our feet.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Back at the car park we 
gathered our belongings and headed straight to an abandoned trailer on a hill. 
Thinking we were out of sight we circled up, and gave the hare his deserved down 
down. As we sang a few songs, the local constable drove by, shining his 
searchlight in our direction looking for the source of an odor complained to the 
police by the locals.&nbsp; As the pack buried deeply in the layer of leaves covering 
the ground, additional complaining was heard as we now smelled the source of 
that odor, our feet had picked up what Zoe left behind. Next, I was invited into 
the circle, after the police left, as I carried the Hashit, unearned for the 
previous week, to be given to the most deserving. Choices were given for
<font color="#FF0000">PU, WIPOS,</font> and even the hare, but the winner was
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> for his lame excuse of having to baby sit the 
children at home.&nbsp; Hell, they’re 20 and 22 and you would have thought they could 
tuck themselves into bed by now. Finally, we had a special naming. The bragging
<font color="#FF0000">PU</font> spoke often that his “Mother Hash” was not Rhode 
Island, and it was there he had gained his handle of <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>, 
which stands for Poor Whitetrash. Now it is Rhode Island tradition that we give 
each hasher, who earns it, our own name and even though it could be argued that 
he doesn’t deserve shit, we proudly and fondly bestowed the Hash Handle of “<font color="#FF0000">misses 
Enema Bill</font>” on the wanker.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">We then gave a good 
&quot;swing low&quot; and traveled off to the yuppie bar where a Britney Spears look-alike 
contest was underway. The winner asked to sit at our table, but just then
<font color="#FF0000">Eager Beaver</font> joined the fray. She had been to a 
business meeting at some men’s bar in Pawtucket, and had evidently dressed for 
her part complete with a dress that had a slit so high that you could see the 
tattoo on her chest. Britney left dejected, and we enjoyed some Guinness and 
Bass along with some sandwiches of unknown meat, and we watched the local 
Cricket match.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">When the beer was 
finished, we sojourned over to the next town for another beer at
<font color="#FF0000">Async’s.</font> Not knowing his address we drove around 
for about an hour until EB got his address from a drunk walking along the 
street. We knocked on his door, rang his bell and were just about to go into a 
chorus of Christmas songs, when down the stars who should appear, but
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> in his Fleet underwear. He refused to share 
any beer with us, so <font color="#FF0000">Eager Beaver</font>, not one to let 
down a bunch of boys, offered us to join her at her house for a nightcap. We 
drove over to the other side of the tracks, walked through the junkyard, crossed 
the trestle and found our way to her love shack in the Barrington Woods. The 
place was a bit untidy, but she had beer and a pretty Greek baby-sitter, who 
entertained us with her new Belly Dance routine. We thanked all for the 
entertainment and made our way home, unscathed.</font></p>
