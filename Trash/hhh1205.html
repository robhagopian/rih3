with no notes, and no recollection of the details. But <FONT

no resemblance to the reality of this hash. First and foremost, no <FONT

color=#ff0000>Donkey Punch</FONT> think we’ll put up with him and his prosthetic 
limbs without <FONT color=#ff0000>Pubic</FONT> to soften the blow? Second. 
What’s up with these Boston wankers showing up in the middle of freakin’ 
nowhere, RI? Have our hash d’erections really gotten that good? Third. Three 
bimbos? What is the world coming to? And how exactly did <FONT

style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The hash started 
from a very small parking area on the Old Danielson Pike, near Anthony Road. 
This much I remember. The limited parking space was entirely filled. I believe 
ordinances were violated. Perhaps a malfeasance or two occured. But nothing out 
of the ordinary.&nbsp;Almost everyone had indulged the hare and worn a 
mustachio. Even the bimbos. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> went whole hog and had serapes and sombreros. A 
lovely sight. Trail out led north into a conservation area on a well-cleared 
trail. It soon turned into shiggy. Swamp was encountered. Small streams were 
crossed. A pond was skirted. There were briars. There were periods of light 
rain. <FONT color=#ff0000>Swampy</FONT> lived up to her name. Yada, yada, 
yada.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

behind. <FONT color=#ff0000>Friar</FONT> got lost. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> got lost. Almoist sounds good, doesn't it? Well, it 
wasn't. <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Just 
Josh</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>JIMA</FONT> led the pack. There was a beer check. There might have 
been some Hispanic-type snacks. Arriba! Unfortunately, everyone made it there, 
although <FONT color=#ff0000>Friar</FONT> required assistance. After the Rhubarb 
rose several times, they followed trail back, flashlights on. They circled back 
to the main trail and returned to the parking lot.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

trail was rated. Bimbos, shiggy, virgin territory, good weather and no pavement 
were up against <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. Total: +0.69, but it was a close one. Hashit to 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, of course. Backslider <FONT 
color=#ff0000>JIMA</FONT> was punished. On On On was at a little restaurant on 
Rt. 6. If you want more detail, contact the hare. I’m sure he’ll be willing to 
stretch the truth a bit for you.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
