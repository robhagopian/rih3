<p><font color="#008000">Run #1058</font>, July 10, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Cranston Ice Rink</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Clear, Mid-80’s</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom, Async, SESYB, Bondo Jovi, Dr WHO, Oozing SD, Fuwangi, Cum 
Under, Mother Goose, WIPOS, Seamus, Ben.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The run started from the back of the parking lot for the Cranston Ice Rink, as well as the Cranston Animal Control 
Offices (a locale all-too familiar to Ben and his master <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>). The hare announced that he 
would be live-setting, and left after donating some beer to the gathering hashers. For no good reason, the hash was 
well-attended, with all the usuals joined with a surprising lapse in judgment by the back-sliding <font color="#FF0000">
Mother Goose</font>. After finishing up their beer, they set off.</p>

<p>Trail was found behind the parking area on an overgrown grassy dirt road, heading northwest parallel to Rt 295. Led by 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, the group came to the end of the short grassy 
path, turned left through some dense poison ivy and came out to Phenix Ave and a check. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
tried straight up what turned out to be a driveway. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> tried left and briefly entered 
the quarry across the road. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> found true trail 
north on Phenix crossing over 295. They soon found the next turn off, back into the woods on an old road. They ran uphill 
on either side of a fenced in cell-tower and found a path parallel to the northbound side of Rt. 295. After a short jog 
along the cliff overlooking the highway, they came upon the hare, and the first Beer Check.</p>

<p>The group straggled in gradually. The spot was pleasant and picturesque. The ambience of a BC on graffiti-emblazoned 
ledges overlooking a man-made canyon cannot be overestimated. Add the diesel fumes and traffic noise of an Interstate 
Highway wafting upwards to the broken beer bottles and used condoms: hash heaven! <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font> 
became increasingly concerned about <font color="#FF0000">Mother Goose</font>, who had not made an appearance at the Beer 
Check after 15 minutes. She backtracked to find her. She was not to be seen again on trail. In true hashing style, 
<font color="#FF0000">Mother Goose</font> soon thereafter arrived from the wrong direction. Things were looking up. The 
hare soon left to mark the next segment, promising a second scenic beer check.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, the pack followed. Trail continued northwest along the highway on at first a well-defined path and 
then, after a check, into some briars and bushes close to the road. Led by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, they 
emerged into the ditch by the shoulder of the highway. Briefly, they went back until they came upon a crossing dirt road 
and a check. It was fairly obvious. The hare had turned southwest, under 295. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> ran together, and as a group decided to ignore a check 
that led north into a swamp. Houses could be seen, just visible through the brush, and it was assumed correctly that the 
true trail would be a worthless loop. As always, it could be stated. Unfortunately, some distance in the rear, <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> came to the 
same conclusion. So the hare’s efforts were unappreciated by all who made it this far. And by this time, <font 
color="#FF0000">Mother Goose</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> had decided to follow <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo’s</font> perennial example and so they turned back for the cars. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> needs more than 
one beer check, anyways?. So a large group was returning to the cars.</p>

<p>Trail was rejoined, confirming the uselessness of the swamp loop. A second check was encountered. <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> tried south, while <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> continued west. <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> relieved himself on the trail. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> found the hare. <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font> found a No Trespassing sign. The rest found the evidence of <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> relief. Trail led 
south then turned back east, paralleling the edge of the large quarry. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried the quarry 
and some logging clearings with no luck. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
caught up, with <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> in tow. They came back to a check on the southbound side of 295. 
Undecided for a moment, they turned southeast.  Only to catch a glimpse of the hare and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
paralleling their course on the cliffs between southbound and northbound traffic. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had to 
be forcibly restrained from running across traffic to climb up and join them. He sensed beer. And not much else! They 
continued.</p>

<p>The group led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> continued southeast. With increasing skepticism, <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> followed all the way back to Phenix Ave. and the site of the first part of the trail. Raising 
Seamus over the wall at the overpass was a challenge, and when it became obvious that the only way to get to the beer was 
to climb over another wall onto the center island, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> decided to pack it in. <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> agreed. So it was <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> that proceeded northwest on the center cliffs to meet the hare and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, just packing up the second beer stop, at a ledge overlooking the first beer stop. The beer 
was unpacked again. Fumes were inhaled, and broken beer bottles kicked about. Apparently, juvenile sex is not as 
attractive on a center island, as there were no used condoms. Youth has no initiative these days!</p>

<p>Trail back was unmarked and uneventful (except for the difficulty in restraining Ben as he approached his 
home-away-from-home at the Dog Pound. The group was waiting patiently. The circle was joined in the grassy area behind the 
parking lot. Ratings for the run: large amounts of pavement and lack of shiggy could not outweigh the multiple bimbos, the 
loss of large numbers of hashers, the two beer checks, the virgin territory and the arrival at the circle of a curious 
skunk. (If Ben had not been quickly restrained from investigating the skunk, the total might have broken 3 digits!) Total: 
<b>6.9</b>! Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, for persistent and unnecessary discussions of soccer. 
They finished up, and moved on to Billy’s Frosted Mug. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> wasn’t there, so you’ll just have 
to use your imagination about what went on that night. Hopefully, some Rhode Island wieners were involved. We know some 
Rhode Island whiners were.</p>
