<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Offering further evidence that the fruit does
not fall far from the tree, the Hash was a father-and-son affair set by
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck. &nbsp;&nbsp;Short Peck </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">was
responsible for the first portion: It began at the Lincoln Mall through
which passed the hares with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing Syph, Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and your scribe pro tempore, the former </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Double
Dipper</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> who whiningly suffered the indignity
of being renamed </FONT><BLINK><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Flaccid Member</FONT></BLINK><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
anticipating the younger hare's course, took the long way around and caught
up later. &nbsp;&nbsp;Notably absent was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Deep
Throat </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">who once again relied on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
for directions; she never did catch up. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The first part of the course was clean, interesting,
and safe, taking the small but thirsty pack directly to the Catamount Amber.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the fruit-not-falling far-from-the-tree theory: That
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> was
thoughtful, kind and civil in setting the run left no doubt that he inherited
the genes of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dog Meat.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The second part of the run, set by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
would have been pitiful were it not for a patch of oozing orange shiggy
in which the elder hare found himself in a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
embrace. &nbsp;&nbsp;Before the shiggy, however, flour marks led the lads
through what must be Rhode Island's last active manufacturing facility
wherein a rent-a-cop with nothing better to do watched five witless wankers
actually follow the hapless hare THROUGH a stream when they could have
take the driveway, 30 feet away. &nbsp;&nbsp;The shiggy was such a refreshing
relief that the hare led the lads through it a second time, and once again
the lemmings actually followed him through the orange ooze. &nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On the subject of ooze, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing
Syphilitic Dick Ta Phone</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> is wearing the Hashshit
once again; this time for twice uttering &quot;r-a-c-e&quot; in referring
to the Hash. To make the offense more grievous, he tried to cop the well-worn
schizoid plea, protesting, &quot;I didn't use that word. And neither did
I.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Retiring to the Friendly Tap, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ooze</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Flaccid </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">occupied
themselves with paper cut-outs while </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async,
Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
reminiced like three old farts and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Short Peck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
ogled a big-butted lass stroking the balls of a pool table. Do we need
to get a life or what? </FONT></P>
