<br/><br/>
At this time of year the pack always looks like it's going to be small as we approach the witching hour, but the usual rush occurs mere minutes from start time, none more so than Crotchy who made a grand entrance at 6:27 and still had time to chat and get in the chalk talk. Fine Ass made a strange entrance to the lot, it looked like she was chasing another car but there was nun. She braked abruptly for no reason, slammed the car in reverse & did a 180 to find a spot to park. Obviously, this space was not to her liking as she revved up the engine and did a quick loop of the lot only to park at the far end!! Was she being followed?? Could the overall maneuvering through 200' of blacktop confuse a tail?? She wasn't convinced and moved again, at this point some of us were getting dizzy just watching this show of driving skills. She hopped out of the car, we told her what we saw and she said she had been talking to Fecal on the phone.
<br/><br/>
The hares' instructions were brief, we headed out in the direction of Breakneck Hill at 6:31 passing Just Pat who was still fixing his kilt. Wandering down the road we finally crossed into the land of no virgin trail. There were many checks and many trails leading off those checks, "'not all falsies are marked" muttered the hare during chalk talk. This gave the FRB's some extra distance to cover and well covered it was as this devious hare has obviously being studying trail setting via some other force. Just the Tip had eaten his power bar earlier and was seen running like a mad man chasing the last IPA in the World, O'Boner and Fine Ass gave up the ghost shortly after the start and decided to sit in a warm car instead, the nice man that owned the car was happy to keep them warm.
<br/><br/>
WIPOS on the other hand knew what he was doing so he got lost in the woods but wouldn't admit it. FF thought that it was the end of the World as she meandered her way through the woods. We were heading South and seemed to be getting further and further away from the cars, was this going to be a typical screwed up BP run?? Olney pond was in sight, the pack was really spread out, there was icy patches covered in leaves and that's where it happened,.EtiClit went down. Nobody was around, so nobody knows if she made a noise.
<br/><br/>
Meanwhile Amish was watching out for hidden rocks in between the jaunts on pavement, thankfully he found nun. At this point trail seemed long, WHO was uttering mutterings and those WHO know WHO know that when WHO utters mutters it's not a good thing. Finally a BN, but wait a minute we had to travel another turd of a mile to actually find the beer. Rusty looked in the bag thought he was hallucinating and reached out for that lonely Captain's Daughter that appeared to be screaming his name at the bottom of the bag, it was no mirage. The rest of the pack meandered in over the next 15 minutes and then it was a shorth stroll downhill to the road and across to the Lodge. Crossing said road was another matter, several cars stopped and one of them was a nice police officer WHO made all traffic stop to let Amish make his way across.
<br/><br/>
We circled up, looked for beer in the bag and Rusty once again found the lone Captain's Daughter. The run was rated a negative 0.69 or thereabouts just because WHO didn't get the good beer. Etti Clit got her DD for being a back slider, there was discussion about the haggis prep for next week's trail and then Basket mentioned Snotty's imminent arrival which is usually followed by a middle of the night departure, Rusty got hashit for having both of the Captain's Daughters and then we went inside to entertain the staff. Meal of the evening was the steak au jus on some type of bread that eluded our infamous waitresses, the tradition of popcorn tossing began as we waited for the grub and once again we were told that green peppers are out of season in Lincoln.
