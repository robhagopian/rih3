<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Multiple wet lashes with a wet 
pasta dish.&nbsp; I'm very tardy in writing-up this run.&nbsp; As I sit here at 
my computer desk in early October, I try to remember what I can about another 
wasted evening in the back woods of Rhode Island.&nbsp; You see, I've been 
hashing for over 18 years.&nbsp; That's a lot of miles, a lot of beers, and lots 
of rotting shiggy shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surviving grey matter is in short supply.</p>

<p>But I'll do what I can to 
remember that muggy hash back in mid-August..........</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It was an excellent
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> trail thru a mixture of old and virgin 
territory along the CT/RI border.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recycle of a superb beer 
check location.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pissed off homeowner because we 
parked at the end of his driveway.&nbsp; Circle-up in the dark behind the 
dumpster of a pizza joint on Route 101.</p>

<p>Detail:</p>
<p>The hash began at the end of 
Old Snake Hill Road in Foster.&nbsp; No parking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> instructed us to park alongside the entrance 
to some guy's driveway.&nbsp; The trail entered the woods down a rough dirt road 
and wound its way north and west through the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp; We skirted the 
property of FM Global's testing lab off Route 94.&nbsp; After a well-laid check, 
and a chance encounter with a doe, (Doe a deer, a female deer...), the trail led 
us west through a recently logged area across the border into the Nutmeg State.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
We wandered about a bit in some confusing shiggy and then hit the dirt roads and 
paths north of Killingly Pond.</p>

<p>We followed the dirt road and 
the North-South-trail to the site of the &quot;Beer Check of the Year&quot; from
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS'</font> bike hash from earlier in the year.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The beer check was on a rocky little peninsula jutting out into Killingly Pond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Plastic lawn chairs were thoughtfully placed to rest our tender derrieres.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A swim raft was about 30 yards offshore.&nbsp; Several hashers cooled off by 
swimming out to the raft.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;Async</font> 
followed them out to the raft by swimming with multiple bottled beers.&nbsp;
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> enjoyed some quality time on the raft with 
the <font color="#FF0000">Hoover </font>(sometimes, it definitely helps that
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> can't swim!).</p>

<p>We spent so much time at the 
beer check, that it was a very dark run on-in.&nbsp;&nbsp; We managed to stumble 
back through the woods, trying unsuccessfully to ditch <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>, on the way back to the cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were thinking 
about circling up... when the homeowner drove up and conveyed his displeasure at 
seeing&nbsp; all of us, and our cars, in his driveway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who woulda thunk it?&nbsp;&nbsp; What's so threatening about of a bunch of old white 
men standing around in the dark, scratching and drinking beers?</p>

<p>We headed straight to that 
pizza joint on Route 101 in Scituate.&nbsp;&nbsp; What more appropriate place 
for our esteemed group to circle up than behind the dumpster?&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, a fine trail for a muggy August evening in Rhode Island.</p>
