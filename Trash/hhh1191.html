<P>&nbsp;<br><font color="#0000ff">The 
Run:<BR> </font><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">To celebrate the 
day after the 250<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns, a large 
gathering was expected by the hare. But only seven (at first) made it. And only 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> wore their 
kilts in the proper fashion. Nonetheless, a festive assortment of kilts and 
schoolgirl skirts were displayed in the parking lot of an office building just 
west of 146. At 6:30, they were off, and predictably ran around the offices and 
east through the tunnel to Lincoln Woods.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The marks were 
light blue on snow and ice. With the normal slightly blue tint of LED lights, 
this made them almost impossible to see. Brilliant! The group found a check next 
to the parking lot. They milled about in every direction. Finally the hare 
indicated a mark crossing a field and heading northeast into the woods. Once on 
a path, it was slightly easier. Trail wound north to a point, and then out on 
the ice of Olney Pond. It had been above freezing for much of the day, but <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> worries about that?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">A successful 
crossing to a small island was made by all. The hare stated that this was a “car 
bomb” check. A car bomb is some collegiate/adolescent technique of: a) not 
tasting hard liquor, b) getting drunk really fast, and c) ruining both beer and 
liquor, as far as taste goes, at the same time. The hare provided Jameson’s, 
Bailey’s, and Guinness. (How Scottish of him, for the occasion!) A shot glass of 
Jameson’s and Bailey’s was dropped into half a glass of Guinness, and 
immediately chugged. Pathetic, really. Not to mention, an awful lot of 
work!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">While beginning 
to work on the second round, they noticed a light, back on the shore. And then 
another. And another. Four lights were seen, and the group on the island flashed 
their lights to entice them out. There was considerable hesitation, but 
eventually, <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> made it across. This was enough for 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Sackless Suction</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Good Pie 
Hunting</FONT> and virgin <FONT color=#ff0000>Brad</FONT> to follow. The whole 
tedious car bomb thing had to be explained and practiced again, while the rest 
sang some more songs. They finally got ready to move on.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail led out 
into open ice, crossing the pond completely. There were patchy areas of slush. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> would worry about that?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A second island was passed, and trail 
was now pockmarked with fishing holes cut in the ice. Unfortunately, the holes 
were easier to see than the marks, so no one fell in. They headed straight north 
to landfall on a peninsula, where the marks were temporarily lost again. This 
provided <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> with an excuse to get lost. He 
promptly did.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail led east, 
then north, then west. The road was crossed. A narrow uphill track was found, 
and this led to the beer check. Ah, it was lovely! No annoying tricks with shot 
glasses. No <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. No <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket.</FONT> A fairly prolonged Rhubarb session resulted, 
virtually guaranteeing that the virgin will never try hashing again. But, 
fearing a late appearance by <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, they finally 
packed up. Trail back came down to the road, heading southwest. It led back to 
the tunnel, and the cars.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The circle was 
held near the cars, pretty much in plain view. Ratings for the run: invisible 
marks, snow, ice crossing with slush, and a whole bunch of iceholes. Total: 
+6.9! The visitors were brought in and questioned, the virgin was deflowered, 
responding with a poor quality joke. Hashit went to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> for no effort at costuming whatsoever, and because 
although <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> clearly deserved it, someone else 
needs a chance, now and then. Finishing up, they moved on to The Lodge, where 
the “Selkirk Grace” was followed by “Ode to a Haggis”, along with other 
favorites, as they washed their haggis doon wi’ ale and a’tha’. 
Hoots.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
