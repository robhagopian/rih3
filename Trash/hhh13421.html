WHO let WIPOS out of the dog house? Why did I cum to another WIPOS hash? And why is WIPOS not at the start of the hash? These are only a few of the questions that we all where thinking.
<br>
From the parking lot we headed East on to nicely groomed trail, curved around into the shiggy and up a large embankment. The first thing noticed was the large amount of floor distributed on trail. The Hare must of learned something in the dog house, needed to redeem himself or is turning over a new leaf. Until we turned North and looped back around South to dead end at the water. As we all searched high and low for trail another question popped into the mind. Did WIPOS pull another WIPOS and not complete his trail? Before the question was answered ON-ON was heard, in the opposite direction of DOB who was on the other side of the lake, go figure.
<br> 
At this point we where weaving in and out of trees collectively finding trail. We then hit a check, pack went left to find marks and pavement. Strolling down the pavement we encounter large dogs and hear a horn to our rear (insert joke). No one thinks twice about ON back, because we all think it is Basket and the first rule of the RIH3 is to never follow or listen to Basket. So we continue ON, trail turns right, heading West, into the forest we return. Hit a check or two and continue on, not noticing the marks appear to be on the backside of wood and rocks (insert another joke).
<br> 
At this time we come across the famous WIPOS marks. The Post-It, which where not mentioned at the beginning so Just Pat was a little confused, but when is he not confused. Once again we all asked What The Fuck are we doing at another WIPOS hash, he truly is a Worthless Insignificant Piece Of Shit. With that said, the trail was the best it was all night and we find the beer stop through the Out Trail. Knowing a WIPOS trail it is always better going out then in.
<br> 
Beer was drank, songs where sung, Hairy pissed in the circle and the temperature dropped another 10 degrees. We departed the same direction WHO arrived and got lost, then found.
<br>
In the circle, chaos commenced. There where two new faces, Basket and Snotty. Supposedly they ran in circles, but we all know they just did a circle jerk. It was Baskets b-day so we all gave him the FU and some dirty toys he will play with at a later date. Oozing was elected HASHIT, but went to Wee_balls for beer spillage.
