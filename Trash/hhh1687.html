Run #1687, July 9, 2018<br/>
Hare(s): O’Boner and FineAss<br/>
Location: Stepping Stone Falls<br/>
Weather: Warm and Cuddly
Pack: PG, Crotchy, Basket, Donkey, Pubic Housing, Fecal, Dr Who, visitors. Dogs. Others I probably forgot. 
<br/>
Hashit: Pussy Galore<br/><br/>

For a trail that began with a dirt road that looked straight out of Deliverance, this wasn’t too bad. Up and over and through the woods we went, as we attempted to follow the marks sneakily set by the dastardly hare. Despite the many rocks that attempted to take me out by the ankles, I outran the deer flies (probably because Donkey collected most of them for the rest of the pack) and survived the brisk gallop to the beer. 
<br/><br/>
There we were greeted by an assortment of random bottled beers, including some which cannot be named here as this is a classy page. 
<br/><br/>
After a lengthy time waiting for the rest of the pack to catch up to us, we sang some songs, pet some visiting beasties and headed back to the cars on a fair approximation of a Classic Buttplug out trail.
<br/><br/>
At the circle all the Harriets were inexorably drawn to the wading pool, wherein Dr Who soon joined them, for safety he said. In case anyone needed saving. Or resurrection. Resuscitation. Restitution. Something like that.  He was mumbling. 
<br/><br/>


Anyways, all trail ratings were done, we sang at some visitors and then the pack moved on to Hashit. It looked like the usual suspects might end up with it, but when it came to light that I had purchased the last three Crotchy Cupcakes, the pack suddenly turned on me and gave me hashit. 
<br/><br/>
I remain unrepentant. Baked goods by Crotchy are always worth any form of punishment. Therefore, not only do I freely admit that I had been a very bad girl, I will take my punishment and write this poorly researched account of our trail whilst eating the last of the cupcakes. 
<br/>
And then send it in horribly late. 
<br/>
Because it’s good to be bad. 
<br/><br/>


Unrepentant to the end.
