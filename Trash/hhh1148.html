<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hare was 
supposedly <font color="#ff0000">JIMA</font>. Say no more! <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> in their right mind would show up for this one? <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> were the only two 
regulars stupid enough to give him the benefit of the doubt. <font color="#ff0000">Europee’in’ Whore</font> is still in visitor status so can 
be excused. (Bet she learned her lesson, though!) For the rest of you: GOOD 
THINKING!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hash started 
form the Lodge in Lincoln, and as it turned out, was actually hared by <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. Like that’s an improvement! It started as they so 
often do, by finding marks at the back of the parking lot. These were the only 
marks seen, however. The hare had prelaid, and the rain the night before had 
made short work of his “efforts”. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> led <FONT 
color=#ff0000>EW</FONT> north and west to the adjacent pond. A check sent <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> into a swamp, <FONT color=#ff0000>EW</FONT> north with 
the hare, and <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo </FONT>south across the road and into 
Lincoln Woods. He was never to be seen again. One small positive note in this 
disaster.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">After it became 
clear that the marks were truly invisible, the hare requested a 10 minute 
head-start, and set off to re-lay trail. This left <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>EW</FONT> alone. In the dark 
woods. But to <FONT color=#ff0000>EW</FONT>’s disappointment (?), <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> doesn’t need 10 minutes. So&nbsp;seconds later, 
adjusting their clothing,&nbsp;they were off. They&nbsp;followed&nbsp;fresh 
trail through brush, light swamp and with a few deer paths thrown in for a 
slight break every now and then. They crossed a few small branches of the 
Moshassuck River. There were no checks, and the two headed north and 
east.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">After about 30 
minutes of this almost unbearable excitement, they finally came to some paths 
and a check or two. The beer was sensed, and as <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> 
ranged over some likely boulders to the east, the hare called <FONT 
color=#ff0000>EW</FONT> to the beer. Who was not far behind. The beer was 
opened, and as dusk turned to dark, they chatted, waiting and not daring to hope 
that <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> had given up and turned home. Fortune 
favored them this night.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail back was a 
cooperative effort, as there was no trail, the hare had no friggin’ clue, and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was not much better. They bushwhacked mostly 
south, and crossed at least three branches of the river. Finally, lights were 
seen in the distance, and<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>they made 
their way to the Lodge. <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> was in his car, in a 
semi-stuporous state thanks to his home brew. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The circle was 
held. Ratings: near virgin territory, good shiggy, no pavement, hare losing his 
own trail, and female-to-male ratio of 1:2.5. There was simply NOTHING NEGATIVE 
TO SAY! But the inverse-square law applies here. Total: -69! Hashit required 
some thought; ultimately it was given to <FONT color=#ff0000>JIMA</FONT> in 
absentia, as <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> has grown to fond of the sexual 
aid within the Hashit, and no one wanted to listen to one of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT>’s songs. After the circle, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> of course headed for home, so it was only three that 
made it into the Lodge that night. Nothing more needs to be said.</SPAN></P>
