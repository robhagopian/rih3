Dr Seuss)</font></p>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial">It was a clear and calm September sunset<br>
The hash made it's way to the Sakonnet<br>
The hash would be in the Tiverton woods</font>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Follow the flour if you would WIPOS<br>
On such a night the run wasn't long<br>
What on earth could go wrong?<br>
WIPOS</font>

</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Through the woods, avoiding skunk<br>
To the beer check to get drunk<br>
High above, the hash could see,<br>
the 200 foot tower, where their cars would be.<br>
</font>

</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">Down the trail as
the sun grew dim</font>

</p>
<p style="margin: 0"><font face="Arial">&quot;WIPOS, follow the trail in<br>
Look for flour, there's quite a lot&quot;<br>
went the instructions to the snot</font>

</p>
<p style="margin: 0"><font face="Arial"><br>
A question rang out from the trees<br>
&quot;WIPOS do you have a flashlight to see?&quot;<br>
&quot;I do&quot; said the WIPOS<br>
so off they went, to the circle they gathered to enjoy a brew</font>

</p>
<p style="margin: 0"><font face="Arial"><br>
&quot;One of us is missing&quot; said the virgin<br>
&quot; The one in camoflauge, slow of foot<br>
dressed every week like an inuit&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Nitwit&quot; we corrected knowing at once</font>

</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;that WIPOS
was absent from the bunch<br>
Do we look? &quot;Oh no&quot;, the Enema man stated<br>
&quot;This beer will get cold, we'll look for him later&quot;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial"><br>
&nbsp;The beer drunk, the teams set out<br>
Into the woods, with lights and shouts<br>
&quot; WIPOS you wanker, where are you &quot; they hollered<br>
&quot;We'll never get food at this late hour&quot;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial"><br>
The search went on till 11:00, how did we finally find this cock?<br>
He hoofed it to Mass to find a cab, so plentiful at that place called the<br>
Quickie Mart</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial"><br>
Or was he abducted by a flying saucer? Lost time and secret implants<br>
Even money is on a quiet trip to the pen<br>
To meet with his sheep lover &quot; Don't worry , we're just friends&quot;<br>
