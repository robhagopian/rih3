<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Back to School Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1081</font>, December 18, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Tucker Field, Cumberland High School</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 30’s, Partly Cloudy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Amish It Head, Basket Boom Boom, Dry Foot Fairy, Justin My Ass, 
Bondo Jovi, Seamus, Ben. Latecummer: Oozing SD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Another run, another late write-up in the form of a lame and inaccurate summary. But with <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi
</font> as hare, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> gives a shit! And also apparently, the Cumberland Police who were set up 
by the entrance to Tucker Field at Cumberland HS. Nevertheless, the gathering hashers had a prelube in line-of-sight of 
the officers only slightly concealed by the darkness. Promptly at 6:30 they set off.</p>

<p>Trail led east to a path behind the field. It soon turned north to a check, and a falsie right to the powerlines. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> chose the falsie; <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> returned, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> jest carries on. Some slight shiggy was encountered, they came to 
the Soccer field, and bushwhacked east at northeast end of the fields to the inevitable powerline. Led by <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> (a recipe for trouble) they came to gas pipeline and turned south.</p>

<p>Finally encountering some good shiggy, <font color="#FF0000">Justin</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> took 
the lead. They turned east on dirtbike/ATV paths. More shiggy was found in each dip in the trail. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> was still missing. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> wasn’t there. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was 
briefly FRB. You can’t have everything.</p>

<p>The trail curved back to the powerline at a familiar rock to encounter the Beer Check. And <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>. This was the same BC as <a href="Trash/hhh921.html">Run #921</a> (Dec 8, 2002). No beer was encountered but as 
usual, the hare’s place of concealment was no match for <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, the beer hound. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> contributed by finding a couch with a distinct cat-urine smell. He rolled in the cushions 
for a while. Was he trying to make himself more attractive to Seamus? <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows! Trying to 
ignore <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, the singing started. But <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> “version” of 
“The Wild West Show” can only go so far.</p>

<p>Trail back was (obviously) north on the powerline. They turned left through the false mark and were instructed by the 
hare to circle up behind a large sand mound. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> used an old truck tire as a urinal. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> found this irresistible and started playing with it. It was 7:30 PM! A new record! The 
circle was formed. Ratings for the run: Some shiggy, the temporary absence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, and the 
incredibly short trail almost made up for the lack of bimbos. Total <b>+0.69</b>. Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> hasn’t a clue why. The On On On was at Tucks, where an unfortunate young family 
with a teen daughter was made to sit through an “Alouette”. And worse: <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> showed up! The 
evening rapidly broke up after this. And that’s all your scribe can remember.</p>
