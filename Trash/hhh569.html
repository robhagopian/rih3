<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This was not Rhode Islands 569th run, actually
only the 567th but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">had
already printed the badges.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was by far the best attended
run so far this year with over 40 participants, coming from Boston, Newport,
Worcester, New York and of course RI. &nbsp;Our hare and co-hare, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> laid
a memorable run on this Sunday.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp; Setting off from Fogarty Hospital car park
which included shiggy bramble, I believe the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Fat
One</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> found all the water and bramble, he likes
flagellation also. The trail went from the parking lot ‘up and down the
road’ onto trail, through water which the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Fat
One</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> tried to consume, over asphalt through
brown shit under power cables and anything else that was seen as a challenge-a
good all rounder. &nbsp;The marked trail was confused with flour by many
with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Gobble Gobble</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> needing
eye checks before they crash into “Mind your Head” signs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Eventually, most of us amassed at the high point
of Rhode Island to some exceptional beer brewed by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo
Jovi </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">with additional juices added by Jake.
&nbsp;Some of our female brethren decided to short cut over water and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Fergie</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
led the way checking the depth with baby pram complete with baby. &nbsp;Everybody
was consuming beers at the rate of knots, that is until it was realized
their were a couple of losses, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Gobble Gobble</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> who
for once came in last, hey </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
now you know how I feel! A wide selection of songs led by our choirmaster
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">. Vote
of Grandmaster went to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Friar Fuck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
who accepted without challenge, more songs then back to the on in trail.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The run back led us down the rocky trail through
more water which </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The Fat One</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
decided to get a real close look at onto some more cunning checks and although
the end was close a final circle jerk was set. &nbsp;At the end, we were
greeted with beers frozen in some remaining snow, with a search party going
out for two lost souls who collapsed probably from alcohol poisoning. &nbsp;&nbsp;The
on-on was at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">’s
house which was no mean feat with over 40 people to feed, the circle up
was long with various calls into the circle ranging from Boston attendees
congratulating themselves to the nomination for the best bugle player and
some non descript RIH3 awards. The circle was by far the longest held for
some time with various runners breaking to get nourishment. Worm was in
attendance in the real form which ended up in Friars grog-did he eat it?
The food was a brilliant hot </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
dish followed by the chocolate prick which was sucked by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Shine</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Stiff Upper Nips</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
The best turnout of the year with official RIH3 nominees being forgotten
in the celebrations. I later found out that by my absence I was voted the
sane GM of RIH3, for my sin of leaving early, it is truly an office I will
serve with dignity, bring in a little bit of British culture, which is
something you Bastards no nothing about, also to introduce a second rule
to the Hash constitution, that is refer to rule one. </FONT></P>
