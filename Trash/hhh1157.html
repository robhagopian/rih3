shed those bulky winter clothes for shorts and revealing tops. Time for the long 
evenings of baseball and beer. Sounds great? But it's also time for another

 Bicycle trail! Why, why, why? Because he's lazy, that's why! As always, a 
trail was planned beginning&nbsp;from&nbsp;the hare's&nbsp;house in Woonsocket, 
looping around Blackstone, MA, and back. Nothing more really needs to be said. 
But to give the hare credit (painful as THAT may be!), he did put a little 
effort into this one. <br><br>It was an understandably small 
turn out. Only <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> (who must be trying to offend 
this girl) brought a virgin/co-worker along. No one else had an excuse. (For 
future reference, these would be valid excuses: "It's a <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>        
            
              
    trail!", "I don't have a bike!", "I've got an important 
meeting tomorrow and I don't want diarrhea!", "The Woonsocket Police have my 
name on file!", etc. etc. )<br><br>The beginning was inevitable. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> therefore led <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> up&nbsp;Woodland to a right on&nbsp;Gaskill. It then of course had to&nbsp;turn 
up, on&nbsp;one of the two side roads with entrances to the railroad grade. 
<font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font>&nbsp;tried the 
first on Warner. It was the second, and so the pack came together turning left 
up May&nbsp;and into the&nbsp;woods. The&nbsp;railroad grade was followed 
briefly northeast, and a check sent them north on what might have once been a 
deer path before it became overgrown.&nbsp;It wasn't even single-track, maybe 
one-thirds of a track or something. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> took the 
first header over his handle bars. <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> soon followed suit. <font color="#ff0000">Jovi 
Juice</font>      
            
            
             
            
           
             
          
              
    had no problems with the terrain and led 
easily.<br><br>Trail turned east. Half walking 
and half riding, the branches and briars still whipped the riders mercilessly. 
The ground surface was dried sand, or leaves.&nbsp;Frequent loss of control 
occured. It probably would have been great fun to&nbsp;watch. It wasn't much fun 
to do. Eventually, they came out just north of St. Stanislaus Cemetery, where 
the hare indicated that his marks had been blown&nbsp;away in the rising winds. 
<font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>... wind... Hmmn!&nbsp;He directed <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font>     
            
            
           
             
             
      to turn briefly southeast on Farm. The 
hare then laid a fresh mark indicating the point of entry back into the woods on 
the north side of the road.<br><br><font color="#ff0000">Jovi Juice</font>, <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> drove through some more narrow, overgrown, 
uphill&nbsp;and sandy trails They finally came out into the sand and gravel 
pits, atop the edge of the main excavation. Biking now was almost impossible. 
Not that it mattered as no marks could be seen in any direction. <font color="#ff0000">Jovi Juice</font> headed northwest along the rim above the river. 
He was not to be seen again. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font>&nbsp;and <font color="#ff0000">LFE</font> followed along the same path; but became uncertain when 
no marks were seen. <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> appeared on the top of the 
rise, soon followed by <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Just Heather</font>        
           
               
              
              
                
               
  . But the hare was nowhere to be seen. And still no marks! The 
group conferred. They finally agreed to head up to the river park on the Mill 
River&nbsp;where so many beer checks have been before. <br><br>They continued through the floor 
of the excavation, the wind whipping&nbsp;grit in their faces. Riding was 
difficult at best, so most pushed their bikes through the loose sand. They 
crossed a smaller excavation at the northwest corner, and took a dirt road out 
to Park St. Turning right to merge with Summer St, they came to the park and saw 
the hare's van. But no <font color="#ff0000">Jovi Juice</font>  
            
              
              
                 
       . No hare. And the hare has upgraded his 
van locks, so NO BEER!<br><br>The hare was missing on his own trail. Normally, this would 
be of some concern. But, the beer was clearly in a cooler in the van. So the 
obvious course of action was to give the hare some time to catch up with the 
pack. So <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> took off to look for the hare. 
Brilliant! <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> says he wants the hashit!The hare 
appeared five minutes later. He opened his van and the BC was held in the 
parking lot, drinking <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>-brew from Poland Springs 
water bottles. A nature-lover was parked in his car in the lot, so not a lot of 
singing was heard. Most were content to rest, thankful that <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> was   
               
                 
                  
              
             
                
           gone. But all 
too soon, he returned, with more tales of heroism and trailcraft and so on, and 
so on, and so on.. So the rest threw an extra brew into the water-bottle 
holder and headed out.<br><br>There was no trail back, but this is familiar 
territory and most could have done it in their sleep. Summer to Farm to Gaskill 
to Woodland to Meadow. What a thrill! They circled up in the garage. Ratings: 
surprisingly good shiggy, complete loss of marks in quarry, a bimbo/virgin and 
loss of Jovi Juice led to a total of +0.69!</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">&nbsp;Hashit to <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>, of 
course, for attempting to rescue the hare! The BBQ was fired up, the virgin 
departed to pick someone up at the airport, and the first rumblings of the 
digestive tracts from the <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>         
                
           -brew 
were heard. And thank God that's over with!</span></p>
