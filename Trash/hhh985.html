<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>After being curiously absent for the past few hashes, this week’s hare <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
arrived at the parking lot of the Super Stop &amp; Shop in a hoochie mamma van, obviously mistaking the hash for 
a cheap date with a wanker’s daughter.&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> bribed <font color="#FF0000">
Dry Foot Fairy</font> with a beer to follow him so he could drop off the van at the on-in site.&nbsp; Mistake. 
&nbsp; Arriving back at the parking lot, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> in Dry Foot’s car, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
knew something was up.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> 
arrived after a fine day of cross-country skiing in the White Mountains to honor our presidents.&nbsp;  <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> asked for 15 minutes to live hare the trail, offering bottles of Guinness and a 
roaming Cumberland police cruiser to keep everyone occupied.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> kept looking at <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> to see if he will 
confess the location of the beer check.&nbsp; Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> told <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> that he will get hashit no matter what, so he may as well confess.&nbsp; Before 
saying anything, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> were off after the hare, 
heading south along Rt. 122.&nbsp; Realizing the golden opportunity to lose <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> confessed that the beer was about a mile north.&nbsp; So everyone watched 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> disappear in the distance heading south, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
concluded that the trail must head up the river behind the Stop &amp; Shop.&nbsp; So everyone headed west toward 
the river, where an ominous tall fence greets them.&nbsp; While <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> openly 
commiserated on how he would get <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> over the fence, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot 
Fairy</font> fortunately came to the rescue and opened the gate, allowing all to pass.</p>

<p>A bobbing flashlight slowly approached signaling what could only be a wanker.&nbsp; Some wishfully guessed it 
was the hare, hoping to catch the hare no less than 100 yards into the so-called run.&nbsp; To everyone’s dismay 
it was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font>.&nbsp; While <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> said something along the lines of “the last check was back there,” a new bridge crossing the Blackstone 
River caught everyone’s attention.&nbsp; Ignoring any mention of checks, the newly constructed bridge beckoned 
everyone to cross it, while incorrectly assuming, for sure, the hare had crossed the river here.</p>

<p>After crossing the river and heading up-stream for about a quarter of a mile without any marks to be seen, 
questions began to surface.&nbsp; With the exception of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, nobody has seen a single 
mark on trail.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> kept asking with increasing urgency, “how do we get back 
across the river?” since he knew the beer check was on the other side of the Blackstone.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> kept reassuring that there is a bridge up ahead.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the pack began to spread apart along 
the monotonously straight run down the Blackstone bike path with no marks, no checks, no nothing.&nbsp; The usually 
fleet-footed <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> was sagging back due to too much President’s Day celebration 
earlier that day.</p>

<p>One mile, two miles passed.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> was worried as no bridge was to be 
found.&nbsp; “Uh oh, the Martin Street bridge is out,” exclaimed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.&nbsp; He 
insisted the river wasn’t too deep for a wet crossing, but <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, living up to 
his name, would have none of that.&nbsp; “Ah, it’s only ankle deep!” <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> exclaimed, 
failing to fool anyone.&nbsp; They continued up the path, as the bike path petered out and re-started again.&nbsp; 
Still no marks, or any sign of the hare for that matter.&nbsp; Unfortunately, all was not lost.&nbsp; Finally, 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket, Dry Foot Fairy,</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> reach the Rt. 116 foot 
bridge, nearly three miles north of where they last saw any signs of the hare.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> lagged so far behind, that some wondered if they turned 
back (the only smart thing to do).</p>

<p>Once across the bridge and on the correct side of the river, they headed south.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> took the railroad tracks.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> had none of it (still traumatized by being cuffed in Woonsocket – another Fuwangi hash), and took his 
own path along well-lit roads.&nbsp; Over and over again, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> tried to 
describe the location of the beer check.&nbsp; “The parking lot of an athletic club right off of Mendon Rd,” he 
kept repeating to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.&nbsp; “Yeah, yeah, it’s the Boy’s and Girl’s Club,” <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> kept replying.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> knew it was not the Boy’s 
and Girl’s Club.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> not so secret sexual obsession with children seemed 
to overwhelm him, driving him to run faster.&nbsp; Even <font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> quietly expressed 
concern.&nbsp; Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> reached the 
beer check (thankfully NOT at the Boy’s and Girl’s club), found the beer, and pondered where everyone, including 
the hare, could be.</p>

<p>Periodically, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> sounded his horn, only to excite the neighborhood mutts.&nbsp; 
Finally, a beer later, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> reached 
the beer check, along a fence next to a sand pit.&nbsp; No <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,<font color="#FF0000">
Ben</font>, or <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>.&nbsp; The night began to look promising after all.&nbsp; And 
then the hare arrives with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> in tow and spirits began to sour.&nbsp; More reason 
to drink another beer.&nbsp; Everyone complimented <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> on the wonderful trail we 
did not run.&nbsp; Except for the beer, the only positive contribution by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> was 
the drive back to the start in his parent’s hoochie mamma van, as the conversation turned to how many times <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi’s</font> parent’s had sex in this impressive love machine.&nbsp; Everyone went to Tuck’s 
for the circle.&nbsp; For trying to put clothes on Sponge Bob, the previous hashit, <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> proceeded to earn this week’s hashit.&nbsp; The wankers went into Tuck’s where the waitress 
immediately ordered the tap of Guinness to open up.&nbsp; Brilliant!&nbsp; Life has meaning after all, even though 
it was still just another total waste of an evening.</p>
