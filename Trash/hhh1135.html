Hash 2007</font></p>

<p><font color="#008000">Run #1135</font>,
December 30, 2007</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">Hare:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bondo
Jovi</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">Location:</font>&nbsp;
Woonsocket</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">Weather:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;:
40's, clear</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">Present:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;Concrete
Feet, Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS,
Cumsockit To Me, Just Sean. Visitors: Holy Ozone, Crucifux (Boston),
Pig-F*cker
(Half-Mein), Europe&Otilde;en Whore (Boston?? H3). Non-runners:
Dogmeat, JBSly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">The Run:</span></p>

<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">Like I said in the last write-up,
this will be short (like
the run) and sweet (unlike the run). <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Bondo</span> was a
holiday hare, as both he and
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span>
seem to be, year after year. This allows the RIH3 to ensure that no
visitors in their right mind will ever return for a holiday run with
us. I
guess the 'right mind' clause doesn't apply to <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Holy Ozone</span> or <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Pigf*cker</span>! It
was
downright embarrassing to see all these visitors. We knew what was in
store for
them, and cringed. While waiting for the Half Mein express, the beer
was
flowing plentifully. This was the only saving grace.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">OK. The "trail". There were only two
questions in our minds.
1) Clockwise or counterclockwise. And, 2) Beer check in the garage or
on trail.
The answers: Counterclockwise, and on "trail" (albeit one block away in
Jovi
Juice's parking lot). What more needs to be said? A street loop through
Woonsocket, less than a mile total. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Pigf*cker</span> and <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Concrete</span> tried
to make it
interesting by bushwhacking along the river in Cold Spring Park, but
this did
them no good. The beer was adjacent to the park as mentioned above. It
was very
hard to get even the smallest rise in the rhubarb.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Circle was held in the unfinished
first floor. Ratings for the
run? I will not belabor the obvious. Total:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-69 to the 69<sup>th</sup> power! Hashit to <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span>, for the
crime of having known the hare the longest. A naming(?) for <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Just Sean</span>: to
cap
the general lameness of the event, the hare was smelling his own meat
pies, and
couldn't wait. The rest were starting to get drunk (Several beers and
NO
running will have that effect!). So <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Just Sean</span>
became: "<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Let's F*cken
Eat!</span>"
Pathetic. But the food was good, the beer was OK, and most of us
urinated in <span class="SpellE">Bondo's</span>
private stock of beer in the basement for revenge.
What a way to start a year!</p>
