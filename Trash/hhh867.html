my garage?”</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> tried to be 
different, as if he isn’t already, on setting somewhat a different type of hash. 
Thinking we were here for the workout, he planned a beer keg sprint around his 
block, after warming up exercises of weights, squats, pull-ups, and 16 ounce 
Bondo Beer curls.</p>

<p>The hounds displayed little enthusiasm, as we were 
expecting, at the very least, a small exertion on his part to set trail.&nbsp; We 
watched, astonished, as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> explained the 
evening’s events. Barbells were fashioned from bars attached to 5 gal beer kegs. 
3 dumbbells stood around watching him enthusiastically go through each event. 
They were arranged to slowly build muscle warmth, until the grand event arrived.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 16 oz Bondo Beer Curl: Starting 
position was the Beer Engine table top, then lifting slowly to the mouth and 
pouring in a sizable amount. This was repeated until the glass was emptied, and 
the other arm was then exercised. 10 lifts each arm.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Keg over the Head Thrust: 
repetitions of lifting a full 5-gallon beer keg over ones head. Keeping the arm 
straight overhead for a full 30 seconds and repeated until the requisite number, 
10 was attained.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Keg Squat: A bar was attached to 
two 5 gallon kegs, and we were to squat between them, place bar over the 
shoulder, stand upright and then squat again touching the kegs to the floor. 
This was repeated 15 times.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .25in">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Final event was taking a keg and 
running the half-mile around <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> block. The 
judge left discrimination and ingenuity up to the competitors.</p>

<p>Since very few of us chose to waste energy on the 
ridiculous, we went straight from the 16 oz curls to the keg run, in an effort 
to get on with food and beer. Now 5 gallons of liquid plus the steel keg weighs 
about 50 pounds and to run any distance with this awkward container, outside on 
ice, would be difficult, if not dangerous. Taking that in mind, the race began:</p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was first to 
grab a 2-wheeled dolly and strap his keg aboard.</p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in">Then <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> placed his 
keg in a backpack strapped to his back.</p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in"><font face="Arial" size="2">Basket opened the top and poured what turned out to 
be Woonsocket water on the floor of the garage, which quickly turned to ice.</p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in">We all stormed out the opened garage door at the 
sound of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> fart. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS
</font>was first to make it to the pavement, and started up over the snow mound 
on the sidewalk. He was quickly passed by Basket as he ran out to the plowed 
street running with the now empty keg on his shoulder. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> got his wheels caught in the first snowdrift, he then un-strapped 
his keg and tried to catch the fleeting 2 ahead of him.</p>

<p style="margin-left: .5in"><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was first to 
arrive, follow shortly thereafter by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, and 
sometime later by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, huffing and puffing. 
Awards were given, a swing low sung, and we adjured upstairs to some Bondo 
Chili, pool and beer. Pretty Pathetic I’ll say.</p>
