<p>Euthanasia isn’t a bad thing.  Actually, it’s quite humane.  You know – like when you have to put down your old dog 
that can’t walk, control their bladder, or groom themselves.  There’s a point in life when a being becomes so old that you 
just want to say “f*3k it, you’ve used up all your good years now it’s time to move on.”  Such is the feeling we have with 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  And this hash attempted to relieve him of the burden of living by letting him play 
around in the woods, by himself, in the dark, to what we’d hope would be his timely demise.  But it was not to be………..</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was to have been the hare, but a last second swap had <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> taking his place.  The pack showed up at Effins in Smithfield, which had just recently been renovated.  A new 
clean pool awaited us.  Some freshly tapped kegs awaited us.  Heaven awaited <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  As 6:30 
rolled on and the sun slowly set over the horizon the on-out was identified as crossing over 5/104/Farnum Pike and around 
back of Box Seats (home of mucho expensive-o pitcher-o).  A little confusion occurred here, but trail was finally found 
heading south towards the dam.  <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> lead the way.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Candy Kaner</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> rounded up the rear.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> also managed to find himself 
a nice piece of trail trash (although technically, it wasn’t trash) in the form of a Molson Canadian table umbrella.  
Yahoo for <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>!</p>

<p>Trail led farther south towards the reservoir’s dam and the first check was encountered.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font> went left towards, and on, the road.  <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Candy Kaner</font> followed.  And soon found out they wish they hadn’t, as trail really went 
right over the Woonasquatucket Reservoir’s outlet, which was 3” of fury (sound familiar <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>?), and back onto dry land.  Holding his umbrella high, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> lead the way using 
it to clear though hundreds of small flying bugs.  A second check was encountered at the path’s intersection with an 
apartment complex, and umbrella-toting <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> quickly found true trail to the left.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> found a little girl’s bike.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was not to be found?  <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cares?</p>

<p>A second cross over 5/104/Farnum Pike (and a quick wave to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> as he drove in late) had 
everyone circling around a small pond and at its end check number 3 was located.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Candy Kaner</font> went left.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> rode straight with <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> not far behind.  With false trail called by <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and false trail called by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> there was only one option of 
where trail could go – left over the outlet stream from Stillwater Pond.  Hey, it’s fall and it’s fairly warm.  We might 
as well use the wet shiggy while we can.  A couple fishing looked at us strangely as all (all except <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> that is) braved the chest-high water towards the other side, where trail continued east towards the pond.  
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> didn’t get wet.  No one was surprised.</p>

<p>Not far up the stream a “B” was spotted, so close to the beginning of trail, awesome!  <font color="#FF0000">Mr. Rogers
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Friar Tuck</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> and the others slowly walked out 
to a large rock that stuck out into the stream and enjoyed the brew.  Some wondered where <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> was.  And then we saw him, on the other side way back near the couple fishing.  Attempting to draw him across we 
cheered and jeered and beered.  It didn’t work.  At least it didn’t work the way we hoped as <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> wussed out and got a ride over via canoe.  Pathetic!</p>

<p>Expecting the beer check to be ruined any second we downed beers and hid others awaiting the old one’s arrival.  It 
never happened.  Thinking that our options where to go on trail and catch up to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, or 
turn around and make our way back to the cars it became plainly obvious that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was meant 
to be in the woods by himself.  And if we were lucky he wouldn’t come back.  A quick turn back down trail, from the way we 
came, up over 116 (<font color="#FF0000">Mr. Rogers</font> voiced his confusion on why we did this) and back down to the 
trail had us going back towards Effins in no time.  Somehow the pack split up, with <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
leading <font color="#FF0000">Candy Kaner</font>, <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie
</font> farther west towards the cars by the way of his trusty car headlight-sized headlamp (<font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> said head?), while the others stayed farther east and hit up the mystery car.  You think this might be an issue, 
but seeing as the first group still had a good amount of beer left in their pitcher they stayed around the cars despite 
hearing horn and whistle blasts aplenty.  I mean, why would you expect <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> to actually know 
where they were going?  After the beer was done, and once the whistle blasts became annoying the small group headed east 
to see the rest huddled around the Basket-mobile drinking from the keg.</p>

<p>And unfortunately, for us (and him), <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> managed to make it.  This only means that he’ll 
have to suffer through life until he meets the reaper through some weird incident like misuse of a Tom Cruise-adorned butt 
plug, or from heart attack # baker’s dozen from a polish sausage, or being hit by a car after bring dragged into the 
street by his whining, crying, annoying, unintelligent dog.</p>

<p>Pluses from the run included no <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> at the beer 
check, beauty view over the reservoir during the sunset (which was NOT planned by the hare).  Negatives were – well, 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> did make it back, having to organize the group after the run from different locations 
and having to cut the trail short in order to leave <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> out on trail.  Mathematical total, 
<b>-6.9</b>!  Hashit was passed around a few times but eventually went to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.</p>

<p>What Effins didn’t know WAS going to hurt them as the group proceeded to the back porch, stripped down to their 
man-panties and jumped into the wonderfully clean pool.  Some swam.  Some dove.  <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
stayed on the shallow end.  Hash 1: Effins 0.  Lots of chips and salsa were eaten and lots of pizza too.  One chicken 
sandwich got thrown in there somehow, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows how that happened - huh <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font>?  The amazing part?  Effins doesn’t quite know what to charge for pitchers so the drinkin’ was cheap.  
Yahoo!</p>

<p>A bunch of songs later and we left that place like a $5 whore – used and abused.  Pool dirty?  Check.  Beer drunk up?  
Check.  Chips and salsa munched down?  Check.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> no longer with us?  Crap.  Maybe it’ll 
work in his (our) favor next time…….</p>
