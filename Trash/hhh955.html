<p><font color="#FF0000">Miles and Miles of Wickford Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #955,</font> August 2, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Tinker</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Co-Hares:</font>&nbsp; Short-Shorts, Just Kayaker.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 80’s, Humid but clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Dr W.H.O., Oozing S.D., SESYB, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS, Seamus. 
<font color="#0000FF">Short time visitors/Backsliders:</font> Just Evelyn, Just Donna.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Tinker’s Nest (the real one), Franklin Street, Wickford.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Please Note: The trail herein described is a composite of all the trails run in Wickford from the last century. 
This write-up is knowingly redundant and unnecessary. In fact, if the enterprising reader wishes to avoid reading this 
tripe, he or she will find ALL areas of this trail combined in the write-ups: #793, #820, #861, #902, and #940. Thank 
you for your time.</p>

<p>The start was at the hare’s well-known abode on the tidal flats of Wickford cove. Arrivals were greeted by a 
worried-looking co-Hare, <font color="#FF0000">Short-Shorts</font>, who was strongly encouraging water intake before 
starting this run. The hare himself muttered something about getting carried away. The hashers had some beer. Seamus 
showed his disapproval by leaving at least seven pounds of moist and steaming feces on the hare’s curb.  But six-thirty 
arrived, and they were off.</p>

<p><i>Mile 1:&nbsp; </i>Frequent large marks led down Elam street to Rt 102 which was followed west to just past the 
Middle School, where trail turned left on a dirt road leading to a small neighborhood, and ultimately turned west on 
the old railroad tracks that have historically been the backbone of Wickford hashing. The group stayed together until 
the first real check, which had <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>blindly blazing ahead, off-trail, <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>making a large circle and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> finding trail with <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. Fortune favors the blind, and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>picked up the marks across Rt 1 long before the others who finally emerged on true trail to cross the 
road just north of the Oak Hill Tavern. Marks were plentiful again, and they all ran up Haverhill, turned left on 
Georgia and right on Virginia (the only thing virgin they would see this night) to the road into the woods heading 
northwest. They rejoined the railroad tracks.</p>

<p><i>Mile 2: </i>All the hashers were again together after a half-mile of meaningless checks. The last of these was 
close to the exit last used by the hare for Run #940, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> explored this, only to find 
what appeared to be an ancient or erased hash arrow on a rock at the end of the street. He was not to be fooled, and 
turned back. He encountered an equally confused<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font>, as well as former two-time hashers 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Evelyn </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Just Donna</font>. They had been surreptitiously 
following the flour, reliving the wonderful times they had had with the RIH3 in the past.  They provided some 
recommendations for the hashers. These were ignored. They were invited to join the hash again. This was ignored.</p>

<p><i>Mile 3: </i>Finally <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tried, against <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> 
advice, and turned up the side path to Warburton Ave. Amazingly, his freakish eyesight cleared up long enough to spot 
some flour further up in the road. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> had missed this completely. [Note to any 
Ophthalmologists who might be reading this: There’s a fortune to be made if you run with the RIH3.]&nbsp; They regrouped, 
and emerged, crossing Ten Rod Road, and running past the sheep, goats and bull that had had <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> so excited the last has here.</p>

<p><i>Mile 4:</i> Trail again led through the back of the Paul Bailey’s Ford parking lot, to the trail entering 
Cocumscussoc State Park heading north. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> led mainly because his need for beer was 
becoming acute, and he hoped that the hare would duplicate his last beer stop in these woods since he had duplicated 
everything else. But it was not to be. A check on the trail led to an acute reversal of direction and the trail began to 
bushwhack&nbsp; east. Several other checks were encountered until one finally stumped <font color="#FF0000">WHO,</font> 
and he circled aimlessly around this check until the others finally caught up with him and began doing the same. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> finally found trail by the simple expedient of heading for the swampiest area, looking 
for shiggy. There was no shiggy. But there were marks, and he called the others on turning south and east.</p>

<p><i>Mile 5: </i>The trail emerged back on road, and continued east on Juniper Dr back to Rt 1. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing </font>led across and through the police station parking lot, making sure to look suspicious and to sound his 
whistle loudly. His acting the terrorist as well as public nuisance was to no avail. The North Kingston police were 
too busy answering telephone complaints from residents whose property adjoins Cocumscussoc to even look out the window. 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, followed by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
curved around behind the police where a group of teenagers were loitering. They asked <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
what he was running for and, always anxious to corrupt minors other than his own, he replied: “Follow the mystic white 
powder; it will lead to beer and satisfaction.” They considered the offer, but one look and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, and they declined wisely. The hashers entered Wilson Park and 
followed trail on the shoreline of Long Point.</p>

<p><i>Mile 6:</i> The trail was now in tidal marsh, but it was still possible to keep the feet dry. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> were faithful to the trail.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> took 
the opportunity to slip into the woods to see if he could duplicate Seamus’s feat at the start. Not a chance. Near the 
boat ramp, a “BN” was seen, but no marks to indicate which direction. But a fellow in a kayak hailed the group and 
pointed out a barely visible blob of flour on an small boat ramp across the 50 yd channel on Cedar Tree Point. An old 
inflatable airline life-jacket was provided for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. It leaked, but not quickly enough. 
The hare arrived to man another kayak, while <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
cooled off by making the swim. <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> afraid that Seamus might drink too much of the 
brackish water which was well-tainted with sewage, refuse and oil, was led around the inlet by <font color="#FF0000">
Short Shorts</font>.</p>

<p><i>Mile 7:</i> The landing was marked by cat-calls from the house that owned the ramp, especially when viewing the 
effect of the cold water on <font color="#FF0000">SESYB’s</font> nipples. The effect on <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO’s</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s </font>equipment was no less profound, if less blatant. <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was hermetically sealed and felt no water whatsoever. Trail led to Ocean Ave. and into 
the backyard of a house where a cooler stood, glowing in the setting sun, beckoning like the holy grail. After a 
brief prayer, the first arrival <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> reverently opened the first beer, and checked his 
watch. It had been two hours to the beer.</p>

<p><i>Mile 7 (cont.)</i> The rest of the group straggled in, and the lady of the house, apparently related to the kayak 
guide, came out to join the soggy crew for some beer and mosquito bites. The hare, the kayaker and another neighbor also 
joined them. The beer was consumed, songs were sung and Eastern Equine Encephalitis and West Nile Viruses were risked. 
It became dark, and it was decided to continue.  <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> was given a flashlight, and they 
were off, much to the relief of the homeowners and neighbors.</p>

<p><i>Mile 8 &amp;9:</i> Trail led south and then west on a path along the shoreline of the salt marsh. The flashlight 
was useful for a few minutes, but they soon emerged on West Main. Marks indicated another swim to the hares backyard. 
All ignored this and followed Brown St around to the alley leading to the same spot. The hare provided a hose and the 
early arrivals showered off before opening another beer.</p>

<p>The circle was joined. Ratings for the run: a swim, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker-</font>style checks, some bugs, 
a police station check, and darkness were over-ruled by prolonged running on pavement, lack of shiggy, lack of lost 
hashers, lack of virgin trail, and presence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Total -0.69. Hashit to <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>of course for not swimming his dog across the inlet. After religion, burgers and hotdogs 
were grilled and the evening ended in a sedate and seemly way. Pathetic.</p>
