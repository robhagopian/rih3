style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">As the first 
major snowfall of the year tapered off, only a few actually decided to brave the 
icy roads to join in the Special Sunday Xmas Hash.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And most thought it wise to bring 
something to help them in the deep snow. <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>, 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi </FONT>and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> opted for 
skis; <FONT color=#ff0000>Swampy</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> 
and <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> tried snowshoes and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> went bare. Smart <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>! 
[Note to self: leave the skis behind, next time!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">At 2 PM, they 
were off. The marks were in ski tracks, with some blue powdered chalk. Trail 
began steeply uphill, across Pound Hill Rd., on Woonsocket Hill. The skiers 
carried their skis to the top of the first rise; the snowshoe-ers had it a bit 
easier, but unshod <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> found it easiest of all. 
Trail led due south. Both <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> had difficulty getting their skis back on. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> succeeded. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> after 20 
minutes of trying, gave up, and proceeded on foot. This proved very 
fortunate.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The hare had 
promised at least one circle jerk, but apparently no one had been listening. 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> led the 
group as they turned southeast at a check. They came out into a neighborhood. 
The hare led <FONT color=#ff0000>Swamp Whine</FONT> uphill and west. He marked 
the check. Ten minutes later, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> arrived at the 
check. The majority of the foot/snowshoe/ski marks went left. So <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> went right. Trail was steeply uphill at this point. 
Another two checks were ignored, and <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> emerged on a 
fiberoptic cable line to find the hare, <FONT color=#ff0000>Swamp Whine</FONT> 
and the beer check!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">They were well 
into their second beer by the time the stragglers emerged, led by <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT>. Soon, all were present except <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. There was some rejoicing, but more interest in how 
anyone could have possibly become lost on this trail. He finally showed up, did 
a facial snow angel, and was serenaded with the “12 Days of Ramadan”. Finishing 
up, the trail was all downhill from here. With <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Fuwangi’s</FONT> assistance, <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was 
able to finally get his skis back on. This was very unfortunate. The left ski 
was fully iced, so <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO's</FONT> progress down the hill was 
most amusing to <FONT color=#ff0000>Swamp Whine</FONT>, and by the first turn, 
the skis were off again, for good this time.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The trail came 
out through a neighbor’s yard onto Pound Hill Rd. Somehow, the hare was able to 
convince the lead pack to take Comstock Rd, and a brief bushwhack to Industrial 
Rd. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Swamp Whine</FONT> 
(surreptitiously aided by <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO’s</FONT> pocket GPS) simply 
followed Pound Hill back to the cars. The group left the parking lot without 
incident, and convoyed to Bellas, where they were ferried to the hare’s and the 
circle. <FONT color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT> made a brief stop at Gators to pick 
up <FONT color=#ff0000>Just Katie</FONT>, and the circle was 
formed.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The run was 
rated. Too much pavement, too little shiggy, and no fractures, broken equipment 
or loss-of-hashers. Total: -0.69. Hashit made the rounds from <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> to <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, but it ultimately ended up with <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Flobanger</FONT>, for being unable to convince his girlfriend to 
join the actual hash. They swung low, and moved inside.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Quite a feast 
was there, with enough food for double their numbers. And when finished, the 
Yank-Me Swap. There was the usual collection of beers, pornographic magazines, 
and handcuffs/sexual aids. But a publication: “I Like Rainbows, But I’m Not 
Gay”, and a pair of Dr Who Socks were the hits of the evening. For the occasion, 
The Bad Doctor had provided another educational video, and all watched, 
pretending to be scandalized. Ho, Ho, Ho! Another Merry Christmas 
Hash!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
