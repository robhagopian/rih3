The directions were rather amusing, sort of like following sheep off a cliff. Was this a set up, did the hare really mean the following and, of course, I paraphrase here. Follow Inman Hill Rd until it ends, then travel on the dirt road, and then drive through the field and take the first right into the next field. WTF, Jimmy isn’t there any decent parking spaces in the countryside?

A meager gathering was supping a few beers in anticipation of the colorful comments that escaped the mouth’s of the new arrivals as they exited their car’s after traversing what could have been some test drive trail for a Yugo. Good job FU was not there, he would have shit himself and that loud muffler of his.

Trying to write this trash in late November is a bit of a challenge, looking at the satellite image of the start it did bring back some memories but they were interspersed with waives of things that might have happened or could have happened, most of which had really never happened yet.

The notes taken by Donkey were sparse, suffice to say he wrote down the names of those present and no hints of anything that may have transpired on trail or at the circle. Thus, this could probably go down the anals of RIH3 history as being a pathetic write up. But, then again by the time Basket actually gets to post it, the rest of you won’t have a clue what happened that night either.
