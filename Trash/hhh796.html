<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The usual crowd gathered promptly, minus the
geographically limited <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font> (who is restricted
by statute to areas of Rhode Island north of 41.5 degrees N Latitude) and <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font>, who has a pathological fear of South County because the deer ticks
might hide in his luxuriant hair. A virgin approached, despite having visited
our web site. <font color="#FF0000">Just Susan</font> had thought to get away
with self-naming, and called herself &quot;Too Slow&quot;. The pack was mightily
confused by the sexual implications of this. She was however, treated to the
RIH3's best behaviour throughout the evening (given our track record with
virgins lately: no one comes back for seconds, several have reportedly forsworn
running and drinking entirely, and a few have taken Holy Orders with the Little
Sisters of the Poor).<br>
<br>
After instructions from the hare prompting a Mexican Hare Dance from <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, the pack was off. Over a rise, they
descended to the bank of Phelps Pond and followed the SE shore briefly,
disrupting several groups of pilgrims who had come to these healing waters in
celebration of Bolivian Independence Day. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. W.H.O</font>.
and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> led <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS, PW,
Just Susan</font> and the hounds along the trail, while <font color="#FF0000">Basket,
Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> ambled along the New London
Tpk to Division Rd where the trail emerged and crossed the road, turning west
into some pitiful shiggy, which even the hounds did not deign to wallow in.
Basket, attempting to miss the beer stop again this week, chose the false trails
reliably. Given the site of his posterior in neon-green girlie running shorts,
no one was anxious to follow him. This allowed <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Dr. W.H.O.</font> to share the lead. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> followed casually, looking for poison ivy to
test the newly reinforced seals on <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS's</font> &quot;Enviroarmor&quot;
(TM). <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was in short cutting mode. Most of
these short cuts led to longer distances, as well as more exposure to shiggy. <font color="#FF0000">Just
Susan </font>was overheard to comment admiringly on the pack's athletic prowess.<br>
<br>
Past a field of junked cars, crossing back northwards across Division Rd, the
trail led through minimally open deer paths, again with sadly avoidable shiggy.
It was gratifying to the pack to realize however that the hare, in order to
place hash marks in the middle of several particularly toxic swamps, had had to
run through the swamp (so easily bypassed by the pack) himself. The beer check
was attained, Newcastle Brown Ale, in a field close to Route 95. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker
</font>had bribed the hare for inside information about the location of the beer
check in order to shortcut and save his energy. Following <font color="#FF0000">Async's</font>
instructions, he had run through Nooseneck down to Breakheart Hill in Exeter, up
Rt 102 to Cedar Swamp, swam across both Reynolds Pond and Lake Mishnock, and ran
up Mud Bottom Brook to get to the check. Nevertheless, he arrived in time for
the last beer, as well as the chance to join in a four part rendition of
&quot;There was a little bird...&quot; &nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Just Susan</font>
stated that the almost ethereal beauty of the pack's harmonization sent chills
down her spine. And who has heard the RIH3 sing the chorus: &quot;A**hole,
a**hole, a**hole, a-a**hole...&quot; and not felt the same?<br>
<br>
Back on trail, they ran east, following 95 through some of the feeblest nettles
ever encountered by the group. The hare, feeling that this was insufficient, set
several concealed lines of barbed wire, a &quot;Malay Man-trap&quot;, trip wires
with bent saplings and pungi sticks, and a &quot;figure-4&quot; Box snare. Apart
from Baxter and <font color="#FF0000">PW,</font> no one was fooled. Cleverly,
the hash marks soon straddled a wire fence with nettles and bittersweet vines on
both sides. Which side should be taken? Either side could lead to the true
trail. But if the wrong side is picked, one might have to go back or even climb
the fence. After long minutes of argument, azimuth checks, GPS readings and
pondering, the group split up: four on each side of the fence. They regrouped in
a clearing 10 yards east where the fence ended. It is exactly this brilliant and
innovative approach to this type of obstacle that makes the RIH3 legendary.
Finally trail led to some good swamp, then over a rise and on in to Phelps Pond
where the&nbsp;Cape Verdean Fish Dance Festival was in full swing.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Baxter</font> led
the way for Bondo, Dr. W.H.O. and Oozing for a brief dip before the circle,
sending hordes of frightened families running for their cars. The others
gathered the beer at the cars, and returned to the pond, where the circle was
held, at 2-4 feet depth, depending upon one's position on the arc of the circle.
Several suspicious patches of unusually warm water were felt by all who were
downstream of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. A rendition of &quot;Singin'
in the Rain&quot; with liberal special effects was started while waiting for
Tinker to arrive. He had again been advised of a short cut by the hare, and had
gone via Tarbox to Andrews Hill and back through Moosehorn Corner. But again he
made it, and the beer was broached. Incredibly, the hare still had left-over
beer from a Christmas party back in the 1970's, and once the initial round of
fresh Guiness and Newcastle was finished, the group was left with stale
Cranberry Lambic and Winter(1978)Ale. Many of these same bottles had been
refused by the same runners at the Snake Den Run (#776) in March, so they were
almost like old friends.<br>
<br>
In spite of the beer, the hare received charitable ratings from most, mainly to
impress the virgin with the pack's forbearance. Overall: 6.9. The virgin gave
the wrong name, was made to cum by some guy named Bob, and equally enjoys all
sexual positions. She almost attempted to sing the tragic but ineffable
&quot;Seven Old Ladies Locked in a Lavatory&quot;, but she and the pack
foundered sadly with five ladies to go. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing,</font>
noting the angry and disappointed bystanders in the pond, calmed the locals with
an astounding imitation of Nusrat Fateh El-Khan imitating Amalia Rodriguez
singing fado in a smoke-filled cafe in Lisbon. This along with a recitation of
the first part of Book II of Camoens' &quot;The Lusiads&quot; by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
had the crowd in tears of joy. The Hashit was presented by its current recipient
<font color="#FF0000">PW</font>. He had brought with it a giant eggbeater as a
scepter wholly appropriate for the group. It had the unfortunate effect of
making the hashit unusually desireable on this occasion: Bondo dreamed&nbsp;of
whisking his wort, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> thought it would make a
wonderful protective device in thickets on trail, <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
W.H.O</font>. thought the proctological uses were too numerous to name, and
Basket felt a glimmer of hope that with this device he might at last achieve
sexual satisfaction of a sort. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>took notes
for his current project: a paper on dysfunctional group activities in the
middle-aged. It ended back with <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> for no good
reason.<br>
<br>
The hare led the pack (minus <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>)
to the on-on-on at a former sports bar, now &quot;Tomaselli's Pizza&quot; in
Warwick, where the group's arrival prompted a rapid and panicked emptying of the
dining room, as well as additional soundproofing of the glassed-in bar area by
the management. [Note to RIH3 Members: Stop ordering appetizers!] The food was
plentiful, but no pitchers and the overall cost per member would have bought
each member a summer home in Pakistan. With indoor plumbing. <font color="#FF0000">Just
Susan</font> proclaimed how much she had enjoyed herself, thus indicating by
past historical precedent that the RIH3 will never see her again. But she'll be
able to live off the leftovers from her small pizza for almost as long as<font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> can keep old beer. At any rate, the group was remarkably mellow,
and enjoyed themselves with a soporific grace that befits their aging members.
So to speak.<br>
