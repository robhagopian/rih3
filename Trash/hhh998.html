<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The hare had resolved to celebrate her graduation by setting her first trail in at least a decade. This was sure 
to bring out the curious and the nostalgic. So to prevent an overcrowded (and expensive) hash, she had made certain to 
send out bad d’erections, with right turns required where only left was possible, and two choice of circles to park in. 
But the ever-resourceful and idle wankers of the RIH3 are used to bad d’erections, and most of the regulars eventually 
found their way to the circle at the end of Salisbury Drive, at the northeast corner of Rhode Island College to join 
the hare. As 6:30 approached, even <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was sighted, cruising around at the other circle, 
looking for the start. A quick cell-phone call, and he was directed to the true start. Around 6:45, they were finally 
off, starting with a check.</p>

<p>True trail was found by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, leading slightly south of west on grass, crossing a few 
parking lots into some woods. There was plentiful poison ivy. Soon a check caused confusion. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried a powerline west. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> north into a neighborhood. Their 
calls drew the rest. But soon it became apparent that this was an unnecessary loop. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> realized this first and turned back south into the woods. Trail resumed west. 
An access path was followed north of the track and baseball fields. Not much in the way of woods, but more poison ivy 
was encountered.</p>

<p>Another check again led to a regrouping. True trail led across a metal ladder/bridge to a field (of poison ivy) and 
then out onto Fruit Hill Ave. A four way check on pavement was encountered. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried 
straight: 2 marks then false. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> tried north on Oak Grove: no marks. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> went northeast on Fruit Hill, 2 marks then false. He impishly called On On, leading the 
pack astray yet again. Ha Ha! What a card! <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> 
found true trail leading south on Fruit Hill Ave. The rest followed.</p>

<p>A check near the entrance to RIC turned the group southwest on Metcalf. Shortly, the first Beer Check was discovered 
at the Ruff Stone Tavern. A fine and welcoming establishment this was, with the head of a large dog (St Bernard?) as 
its logo. Once the hare caught up, they entered and had pitchers of Guinness and Bass, distributed in 8 oz frosted 
glasses. [Why would a bar bother frosting 8 oz. glasses? Do they cater to Newporters? But I digress.] <font 
color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> was admitted to the establishment, and was much admired. The group was unusually 
well-behaved. There was no singing. But with only two pitchers for the 11 hashers, no one was about to lose any 
inhibitions just yet.</p>

<p>After finishing off the beer, they were on out, through back door. Trail led on Brook St southeast to a check, and 
crossing Fruit Hill Ave., they re-entered the woods. Eastwards they ran, with little of note to challenge them. Small 
amounts of poison ivy were found, but nothing like the luxuriant growth at the campus. They came onto the Triggs 
Memorial Golf Course. Crossing Hole #1 (379 yd, par 4) was no challenge as the light rain was starting, and no new 
foursomes were beginning. However, they continued onto hole #9 (391 yd, par4). A group coming to their balls on the 
fairway was surprised by the hashers. They crossed in front of the golfers with calls of  “On On!”, “Hashing through!” 
and “FOREskin!”. The hare had to hang back to apologize and make excuses. Possibly sexual favors were exchanged.</p>

<p>The second Beer Check was at the clubhouse. Once the hare broke away from the irate foursome, she provided Bass in 
bottles, served under a tent outside the clubhouse. The rain was now steady. And with an audience on and off the course, 
it was inevitable. The singing began. The clubhouse emptied of paying customers. But the rhubarb made its first 
appearance in a few weeks. After a few dozen songs, the group was all too willing to head out in the rain for the rest 
of the trail. The hare warned of a steep rock climb on the way back. In the rain. Crossing some poison ivy. Things 
were looking up, or was it just the mood-elevating effect of two beer stops in the last ¾ of a mile?</p>

<p>On Out led east between #13 (447 yds, par 4) and #14 (140 yds, par 3). No golfers were seen. No poison ivy was seen. 
But in the rain and waning light, it was hard to see the fairway. They emerged on and crossed hole # 15 (496 yds, par 5).  
Trail was led by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> northeast along the border of 
the fairway. They came to a water hazard at #16 (302 yds par 4). <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> valiantly (i.e. 
stupidly) followed marks in the mud along the shore of the hazard.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">DFF</font> took the cart path. They ignored the frantic calls from 
the hare who was trying to get the FRB’s back, afraid they might miss some shiggy. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
began searching for balls. He found some in the poison ivy, but they were only golf balls.  His wife will again be 
disappointed. Finally they crossed out of the woods and emerged onto College Rd.</p>

<p>A check led east to first left (right) and through a parking lot north to some woods in back. Another check sent 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> west on an on overgrown paved walkway. <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> found true trail by following the poison ivy north. A short bushwhack began. It curved 
slightly to the west to a large rock. This was climbed. From the top, flour words could be made out. “ONE ELL 31-1” 
it seemed to say. The hare, at the base of the rock claimed that it read: “H3 THE END”, but this was patently not the 
case. It was raining pretty hard, though. But there was no beer. There was no poison ivy. There was no reason to 
prolong this. Crossing the rock, they ran out to Salisbury Rd. and the cars. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
distributed his balls. This was sufficient to cause the group to agree to circle up at the On On On, back at Ruff 
Stones.</p>

<p>They drove back to Ruff Stones, singly and in convoys, only <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> lost because of a 
broken seal on his Kevlar armor. After changing, refreshing, cleaning, wanking or whatever, they entered. They put 
some tables together, and at the hare’s insistence, started the circle. Sitting!. Menus on their knees! The Monks of 
St Bernard hid in their cloisters for shame! But (while the waiter took orders!) they rated the run. The ratings 
overall were favorable: rain, 2 Beer Checks, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, poison ivy, confused golfers, 
loss of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, and a possible regular addition to the hareline: <b>+6.9</b>. (Forget 
the pavement, lack of shiggy, no losses on trail, excessive flour use, and 8 oz frosted glasses. But the RIH3 is 
nothing, if not forgiving! Especially if it means more regulars setting trail.) Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> to <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> to <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font>. Don’t ask!  The circle 
was completed, and the food arrived, signaling time to really start singing. The hash was encouraged in this by the 
bartender who, being a frustrated rugger, came and sat in to sing verses of all the classics. Voices were strained, 
eardrums were pained and no one complained! Pathetic!</p>
