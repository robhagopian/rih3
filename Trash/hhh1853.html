It's back to school week and O'B is starting us off from the basics. We be startin' from the Lodge. WHO knew this would happen, but he didn't show up. Neither did Rusty, as he was back in Ireland. Basket, OOzing, WIPOS, Butt Plug, Cracker, Fineass Cuntsultant, Sautee Man and son Just Jaz, Just the Tip, OMIT and Pussy joined O'Bone'r behind the Lodge for a memorable Hash.<br/><br/>
There was one flour mark in the driveway going behind the Lodge, but after Chalk Talk, O'B sent us across Breakneck Hill Rd into Lincoln Woods. Most of us easily crossed the busy street, but OOzing made a hop, skip and a jump over the drainage ditch and went head over heels on the bank. WIPOS thought he'd take a shortcut and went left into the woods behind the Lodge. We didn't see him again until the end.<br/><br/>
The trail, in Lincoln Woods, followed familiar and well worn tracks out along the horseshit laden trails. From the start I tried shortcutting and went downhill towards Quinsicket Rd. I could hear the pack to my right and uphill as I hit the pavement. I went right and soon found flour going left  into the woods. I called the pack on, and continued following flour alone for over 15 minutes. Slowly, I could hear the pack behind me, as I followed the meandering trails up, down, and around the many trees, rocks and many blowdowns. At a check near the fence on private property, I went right towards the ball fields and found a mark. Just the Tip caught up with me and he continued straight, but finding only one mark, I turned around and went left.on flour. After a couple more checks, I ran out of flour at the roofless building and started back to the check. JtT and Butt Plug were wandering like chickens behind me. I went uphill and found flour and PG; and was back on trail again. We continued to the small pond/cave and found Beer at the top of the rock pile. <br/><br/>
Eventually everyone but WIPOS showed up. 
Beer, orange food and songs were enjoyed as we called for WIPOS. Beers done, we started back crossing the roads and back to the Lodge. Cracker found an Iphone on the road that was later found to be owned by a young lady that had it tossed out of the car window. How Cracker found it and why it was tossed is left to conjecture. <br/><br/>
Back at the Lodge, we circled in our usual location as OOzing went into the bar to find WIPOS. He was found sitting at the bar and eventually joined us near the end of the Circle. We roasted the Hare of her trail setting. Most comments were supportive as O'B looked drained from the trail in the hot and humid conditions. Nonetheless, she got a .069 and drank for her efforts. Backsliders Butt Plug and Fineass were questioned by OOzint. They drank and sang WAAA in honor of Rusty not being there. The virgin was questioned and refused to say his father made him cum, but did say he enjoyed the Hash. Next Hashit was tossed around and although I thought it would stick to OMIT or WIPOS should have gotten it, it was mine to drink for. We went into the Lodge afterward and found the redecorated back room lacking the salad bar and our free jalapeno. There were also no green peppers...disappointing.<br/>
