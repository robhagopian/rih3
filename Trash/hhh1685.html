With the trail being on the longest Monday of the year, it makes sense that the hares would pick a place about as far in the outskirts of the state as possible. Despite that, there was quite a crowd, most of WHO were on time. The trail began with a long stretch without a check in sight, and hardly any marks. With the promise of a Check Back 8, everyone was hesitant to go too far ahead. While there was finally a check, the lack of marks continued throughout the trail.<br/><br/>

After passing the lake and a dead turtle, the pack wound its way through the woods, eventually finding a suspicious arrow diverting the trail. Despite knowing full well it would likely lead to the check back, several members of the pack decided to take one for the team and find out for sure. Which they did, having to backtrack only to find that the hare had left a new arrow pointing towards to actual trail. It wasn't before long that we found water, and of course the beer right next to it. The 2 cans of Captains Daughter were quickly snatched up, leaving an otherwise typical beer stop. Just Pat came waltzing in right as the final beers were almost taken, and revealed that he followed the now defunct trail to the check back, despite there being distinct marks to the proper trail. And yet here I am writing this.<br/><br/>

The pack made its way back to the cars for the circle, where we were able to cool our feet and get a little wet. Amish in particular somehow managed to make the harriettes even less wet despite kicking water at them. The trail was given overall positive ratings, leading to an overall negative .69 rating. I don't think the on after was ever truly decided. WIPOS went to ocean mist anyway.<br/><br/>
