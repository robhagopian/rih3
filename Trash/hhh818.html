  With little fanfare, the dogs were loosed and they were off, north on the 
  driveway for the Greater Rhode Island Baptist Temple.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The road was clear at first. After passing the Temple 
  itself, paralleling Rt. 295, a light covering of snow was encountered and the 
  flour stopped, to be replaced for the most part by footprints. The trail led 
  to a field covered with pockets of standing water, the sad result of a septic 
  system accident after a particularly moving revival meeting at the Baptist 
  Temple. Negotiating these water hazards was no problem, and the group spread 
  out over the field trying to find the true trail. Occasional marks of whitish 
  orange could be seen by all except for the visually challenged

  but the best sign of the hare's passage was still the footprints. 
  Unfortunately it was discovered that when everyone spreads out over a field 
  looking for footprints in the snow, the result is: an awful lot of footprints. 
  This led to several hound-created circle-jerks that would have heartily 
  satisfied the hare, had he witnessed the scene.<br>

  Finally, trail leading west into the woods was found. Skirting around the 
  sides of Cat Rocks, bushwhacking (through the prototype for the Johnston
