<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">The “Oh Wow, it’s Another ‘Round the Reservoir Hash” Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1046</font>, May 1, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Diamond Hill Park, Cumberland, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 60s, partly cloudy, windy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Async, Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Oozing SD, SESYB, 
Fuwangi Boner, Seamus.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Not Present:</font>&nbsp; : Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, Oozing, Dryfoot Fairy, Dr. WHO, Amish 
Ithead, Cumunder, Async, Seamus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><i>Note: It was no surprise when directions were finally posted sometime mid-day Monday that the hash would be in 
Cumberland.  If <font color="#FF0000">Fawangi</font> was too lazy to post directions earlier, you know he’d also be too 
lazy to lay trail far from home.</i></p>

<p>Just like <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> gear, the pack showed up in layers.  <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dryfoot</font> were first 
and took off with the hare on time.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were a 
few minutes late but not far behind.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was next to last and somehow <font 
color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> took the rear entrance (maybe a renaming to Lu-Lu is in order?!) and followed trail 
backwards to meet everyone post-beer check.</p>

<p>Things started off by leading the pack uphill for a scenic view of Cumberland.  Or at least I assume, being late <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and I followed the toots of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> rather than the hare’s flour-marked trail so I don’t know for sure.  Haha, toots.  By a pair of fruits.  It 
rhymes, get it?  Man I need more sleep.</p>

<p>Anyway, going up the ski slope and then back down the other side led us to a dead end street within a condominium 
development filled with the friendliest of occupants.  One was even nice enough to step outside and greet <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> with a “Don’t you realize this is private property….you’d better not be coming back through 
here again!!!”  Strange, if I saw <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> plop out of the woods in front of my house I’d stay 
inside and lock the door, a character of his nature is never up to any good.</p>

<p>After a short spell of pavement, trail led back into the wilderness going east.  A little bushwhacking here, a little 
bushwhacking there and next thing you know a beautifully packed trail was before our eyes.  And the reservoir.  Wonderful 
Diamond Hill Reservoir.  Wow, what a shock.  With <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> leading as FRB, <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and a newly shaved Seamus (I much prefer the look of a shaved pussy to that of a shaved dog) close behind, 
everyone headed clockwise around the reservoir.  There was a check or two, but they fooled no one.</p>

<p>Upon arrival at a “BN,” <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turned left and 
climbed the face of a steep hill towards heaven in search of the nectar of the gods.  Instead they got <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, who’s not God and foolishly climbed up after them with no beer in hand.  Hoping they could 
fool other hashers, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> blew and blew his horn (being able to blow your own horn, isn’t 
that a prerequisite for Grand Master?!), and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> called on-on.  <font color="#FF0000">
Dryfoot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> soon arrived.  Only <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> stayed on 
trail (not counting the hare, of course) although not due to superior intellect, but due to complete laziness.  With beer 
still not in sight and the super cool subset of the hash up on the rocks high above you think he’d get off his lazy ass 
and  look around a bit.  But he didn’t.  Once the super cool subset of the hash came down from the rocks true-trail was 
found to continue following the reservoir’s edge and much farther away than the “near” of “beer near” should mean, we 
arrived at the beer check.</p>

<p>Although no songs were sung (other than a single pathetic attempt as everyone chugged their beers prior to heading out) 
the beer check did have some Victory Storm King Stout (STORM KING!!), which is pretty damn good and pretty damn strong 
despite <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> criticism, so not all was lost.  As the beverages were being enjoyed a flash 
of yellow streaked through the woods – <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>.  Much to his shagrin, the Chariots of Fire 
theme song was not to be played for his arrival.  Discussions on the Interhash, the past Saturday’s Purgatory Chasm 
Boston Shiggy Hash and other nonsense were held prior to a quick departure back on trail.</p>

<p>The pack headed left scaling yet another steep hill while <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and Seamus continued 
straight.  Much to our displeasure both trails converged not much farther ahead so the two were not lost to be arrested by 
Cumberland’s finest.  After more up and downhill action the group came out into the back of a new neighborhood, although 
not the above mentioned development with the friendliest of people.  And <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> did we see?  No, 
not <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> been with us the whole time – none other than 
<font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font>.  Camouflaged by hiding her normal fluorescent pink vest under a black fleece she 
talked about heading this way and that way on trail but never reaching the beer check.   Much shrieking occurred.  Back 
into the woods and back up the ski-slope hill the pack finally settled in near the cars and the circle was formed.  More 
Victory was consumed (STORM KING!!) and the run was rated.  Despite the setting sun everyone could see the brown on 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> nose he gave it a 20 on his scale.  <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> was pretty 
happy about spending some quality time with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> in the beginning.   <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> complained about the lack of septic system shiggy.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> complained about <font 
color="#FF0000">Dryfoot</font> being quiet.  Mathematical total: <b>-0.69</b>.  Yahoo!  Hashit given to <font 
color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> for some reason, I’m not quite sure (STORM KING!!!).  Much shrieking occurred.  The 
driving winds moved everyone along to Tuck’s were more beverages were consumed along with bread and soup.  Seven more days 
till I need to see you wankers again.  Thank god.</p>
