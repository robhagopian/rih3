and yours truly. The run set off after our customary photograph into the
woods after we had been told that at least 20 Lb.’s of flour had been dropped,

meant on the road somewhere between his house and the trail, as we all
had problems seeing the trail at some stages. The evening air was cold
at around freezing point, with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Deep Throat

was only too glad to oblige and offered to put some shape into her. They
quickly disappeared and were not seen again until the beer stop which was
at the end of the trail. This run had good qualities for a summer run,
up and down round and round with checks well placed, but someone should
have told </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
it was winter. All the ingredients of a good run and no doubt took a while
to set, but some of we runners mentioning no names except </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
were whining and others amongst us suggesting the run was boring. After
a good fifty or so minutes of up hill and down dale with so many circles
many of us very nearly disappearing up our own backsides, we arrived at

was in a dilemma as Jake had taken the car keys and locked all the doors

to display his disappointment at such a poor run, finally </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
