<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> Dr WHO</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Mid-30’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Hill-Roberts Elementary School, Attleboro, MA</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Async, Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS, Seamus, Jake,
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font>. <font color="#0000FF">Latecummer:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Starting from the School, the trail led back out Roy Avenue to a check which had <font color="#FF0000">Async, 
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>all going into the woods in various wrong directions. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>finally picked up the flour in a patch of refuse and slime (his natural habitat) heading 
northeast into a nature preserve. After a few stream crossings, and a few boggy areas the trail came out to Hope Ave., 
and turned right back in to a loop trail with double checks.  <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> got it this time and 
crossed the Seven Mile River, leading the way into a bog/briar bushwhack that ended up in the Newell Cemetery.</p>

<p>After blaspheming and desecrating for a while, they crossed onto Read St. where a check sent them into the Attleboro 
Water supply at Orr’s Pond. Trail led southeast through the fields, across a bog and uphill to a “CB 4” which satisfyingly 
was not discovered by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> until all had sloshed through the muck. Back they went, re-
crossing the bog. They turned east towards the sounds of gunfire. Apparently, this is what there is to do in Attleboro on 
Monday nights. Being somewhat nervous about this unseen target practice, they let <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
take the lead. Unfortunately, the trail turned south before anyone got winged.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the trail led to another and more extensive bog. The hare tried to follow <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS </font>as he leapt across one small stream, and ended up losing a shoe in 14” of mud. While digging it out he could 
not give any hints, so when he caught up to the pack, they were confusedly looking for trail on a gas pipeline. The hare 
thoughtfully directed <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> down a long northeast 
falsie. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had taken the wrong turn by instinct and was headed southwest back to the 
first bog.  <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> tried to follow the hare, who led straight across the pipeline to the 
trail on a winding path through some old tire dumps and poison ivy. Eventually they came out at the power line along Rt 
95, where they found the Beer Check. The stragglers caught up and they all had some beer.</p>

<p>On In led southwest on the power lines, through a small bog. They came out through a new home construction site, and 
turned south on Read St. Trail then led west through a neighborhood, following chalk marks that even the hare could not 
see. Luckily this stopped them all from wasting time on a few unnecessary checks that they all blew past. The path back 
to the cars was discovered when they encountered a bewildered <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> who, arriving late, 
had tried to back track. He was foiled again by the hare’s incompetence.</p>

<p>They circled up behind the Little Red Schoolhouse. Ratings were favorable naturally: multiple bogs, disorientation of
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, gunfire on trail. Total: 6.9! Hashit stayed 
with <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> because she wasn’t there to defend herself. On On On was at Weatherlane’s on 
County St. Another brilliant effort by the bad Dr.</p>
