<p class="MsoNormal">This is only a summary. If <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span>
remembers it better, he
can redo the write-up. F*ck this, anyways! Why am I always stuck doing

But I digress. For Xmas, then, the hare set a trail from the Hardware
store at
the Forestdale exit off 146. Some visitors showed up, certain to be
disappointed. The hare was live setting, in crusted snow. The trail was
a
counterclockwise circle, with a nice falsie to the right up to the
powerlines
almost immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pack was
fooled long enough for the hung-over <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);" class="SpellE">Fuwangi</span>
to catch
up. It then turned northwest on 146a, and turned into some light woods.
The
river was crossed, and trail turned southeast, entering the North
Smithfield
industrial park. There was a beer check. I have no clue where at this
point.
But enough was provided that I was soon thereafter able to pee my name
in the
snow for <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Just Rebecca</span>. So that was OK, at least for me. She appeared
unimpressed. Soon thereafter, trail led along and then crossed the
railroad
tracks. 146 was crossed. The pack was mostly together. They came out on
Great
Road. Trail turned northwest again. Holy Ozone found a school desk that
had
been made into a makeshift toilet(?) He of course had to bring this
along. And
that's about it for the trail in my limited recall. What do
you want? It's
f*ckin' April, already!<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The circle was held at
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket's</span>. The School desk/Toilet was
filled with ice for the hare to sit upon. The run was rated: some
shiggy, some
bimbos, and beer weighed in against the substantial pavement, and lack
of
losses on trail. In the Xmas spirit: total +0.069. <span class="SpellE">Hashit</span>

Cum Socket-to-me. The visitors were punished, as if they
hadn't had enough to
endure, with the trail. The group moved inside for food, and the <span class="SpellE">Yankme</span> Swap. The only gift I can
recall was my own
carefully mastered DVD copy of "Flesh Gordon".

So, please feel free to send <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Basket</span> your re-writes. I'm
moving on the New
Years' Hash. That one will be even worse, but at least the
torturous &frac34;
mile of Woonsocket trail isn'</p>
