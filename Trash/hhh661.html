<P>It was a dark and stormy night.&nbsp; Fog covered the highway as I drove
along
<BR>Rte 44 toward the old stagecoach stop at Cady's Tavern.&nbsp; The fallen
snow from
<BR>the weekend's storm had been thawed and refrozen into a slick river
of shiggy as
<BR>rain fell heavily upon the strange orange marks upon the trail, now
<BR>disappearing in the night. Fuck me say's the hare…fuck you say's I.

<P>The hounds arrive slowly at first, even cautiously, in concern of life
and
<BR>limb.&nbsp; Surely, the Hare had called off the insanity of hashing
in such a
<BR>night.&nbsp; "Never," said the Hare, " and don't call me Shirley."&nbsp;
First to
<BR>arrive was <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT>.&nbsp; "A saintly soul
floats on the Stygian river;
<BR>And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore!
<BR>See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!"
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT> then arrived next followed by<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
the Slut</FONT>.&nbsp; Wondering why we would be
<BR>here on such a night, rain falling now in buckets, what were we thinking?&nbsp;
"In
<BR>vain I struggled to realize -- to regain it. Long suffering had nearly
<BR>annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an imbecile -- an
idiot."
<BR>We drank a beer, a Sam Smith Imperial Stout, but even it's strength
gave
<BR>little resolve to the night ahead.&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">WIPOS</FONT>
pulled in with <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Cheap Licker</FONT> just
<BR>behind.

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT>'s horn blew the hound to hash.&nbsp;
"And now have I not told you that
<BR>what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses? Now,
I say,
<BR>there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes
when
<BR>enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well too. It was the beating
of the old man's
<BR>heart. It increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the
soldier
<BR>into courage.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even yet I refrained and kept still.
I scarcely breathed. I held the
<BR>lantern motionless."

<P>The flour started across 44 in George Washington Park.&nbsp; Dodging
cars,
<BR>crossing the road was dangerous enough, but the trail called us on
ice and coldness
<BR>there.&nbsp; Flashlights illuminated the danger here.&nbsp; First to
fall was <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Cheap</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Licker</FONT>. "It was many and many a year ago,
in a kingdom by the sea, that a
<BR>maiden there fell whom you may know by the name of Abigail Licker."&nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT>
<BR>joined the fallen as feet above head did fall.&nbsp; "Ah, broken is
the golden
<BR>bowl! The spirit flown forever! Let the bell toll!"&nbsp; The hare
must of
<BR>thought his deed was done&nbsp; "He shrieked once -- once only. In
an instant I dragged
<BR>him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled
gaily, to
<BR>find the deed so far done. But for many minutes the heart beat on with
a muffled
<BR>sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through
the
<BR>wall."

<P>Much flour was lost in river flow, but enough was left to cover trail
<BR>towards beer and beyond.&nbsp; We each thought of what cost this hare
must pay for such
<BR>a devious trail. "There was an interval of utter insensibility; it
was brief;
<BR>for, upon again lapsing into life, there had been no perceptible descent
in
<BR>the pendulum. But it might have been long -- for I knew there were
demons
<BR>who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration
at
<BR>pleasure."

<P>Finally, the beer stop amid trees standing tall there a small shack.&nbsp;
A
<BR>slight protection against the storm, but enough to enjoy the Sam Adams
Cream
<BR>Stout. "Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned
more
<BR>narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed
to
<BR>be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been
great.
<BR>Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled
<BR>web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary
dilapidation"

<P>I opened the bottle without hesitation.&nbsp; "Down -- steadily down
it crept. I
<BR>took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral
<BR>velocity. To the right -- to the left -- far and wide -- with the shriek
<BR>and the plunge of a damned spirit! to my heart, with the stealthy pace
of the
<BR>tiger. I alternately laughed and howled, as the one or the other idea
grew
<BR>predominant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down -- certainly, relentlessly down!
It vibrated within three inches
<BR>of my bosom! I struggled violently -- furiously -- to free my left
arm.
<BR>This was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter,
from
<BR>the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.
Could I
<BR>have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized and
<BR>attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted to
arrest an
<BR>avalanche!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down -- still unceasingly -- still inevitably
down! I gasped and
<BR>struggled at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep.
My eyes
<BR>followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most
unmeaning
<BR>despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent, although
death would
<BR>have been a relief, oh, how unspeakable!"&nbsp; Thank god for beer
and hash.

<P>Flashing of lightning shone bright the night air, as rain danced upon
the
<BR>wooden wall of shelter there.&nbsp; An occasional thunder burst interrupted
our
<BR>singing for but a minute, and then a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT>
fart prompted us to again join
<BR>trail. "&nbsp;&nbsp; 'O God!' half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her
feet an extending
<BR>her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these
lines -- 'O
<BR>God! O Divine Father! shall these things be undeviatingly so? -- shall
this
<BR>Conqueror be not once conquered? Are we not part and parcel in Thee?
Who --
<BR>who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor? Man doth not
yield
<BR>him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness
of
<BR>his feeble will.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, as if exhausted with emotion,
she suffered her white arms to
<BR>fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed
her last
<BR>sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips."&nbsp;
"Let's get the fuck
<BR>out of here," said <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Cheap</FONT>.

<P>The end was near when the final beer stop was found behind trees, not
far
<BR>from Rte 44.&nbsp; The hare was called into the circle, "The old man's
hour had come!
<BR>With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.
He
<BR>shrieked once -- once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor,
and
<BR>pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed
so far
<BR>done. But for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound."&nbsp;
The
<BR>circle was just as quickly finished as rain, falling relentlessly,
drove us
<BR>on to the Inn of Cady's.&nbsp; In the warmth of the friendly abode,
was <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">RIPTA</FONT>.&nbsp; She
<BR>claimed she tried, in vain, to find trail, and even showed us wet stocking
<BR>as proof.&nbsp; "Mimes, in the form of God on high, Mutter and mumble
low,
<BR>And hither and thither fly --&nbsp; Mere puppets they, who come and
go
<BR>At bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro,
<BR>Flapping from out their Condor wings Invisible Wo!
<BR>That motley drama! -- oh, be sure it shall not be forgot!
<BR>With its Phantom chased forever more, by a crowd that seize it not,
"

<P>Beer was ordered and food to warm the bellies and fill the sole. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT>
<BR>presented the newly improved RIH3 Hashit, and it was quickly given
to <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Cheap</FONT>
<BR>as the most deserving and best fitting for such an award. "And now,
as if
<BR>exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall, and returned
<BR>solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her last sighs, there
<BR>came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips."&nbsp; "Fuck me",
fuck you,
<BR>indeed, the Hashit is yours to enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The conversation
that followed was strange
<BR>indeed, and much was thought and spoken until we parted for the night.

<P>"Out -- out are the lights -- out all!
<BR>And over each quivering form,
<BR>The curtain, a funeral pall,
<BR>Comes down with the rush of a storm,
<BR>And the angels, all pallid and wan,
<BR>Uprising, unveiling, affirm
<BR>That the play is the tragedy, "Man,"
<BR>And its hero the Conqueror <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Worm</FONT>."

<P>We drove home, the storm now ended and none thought more of that fuck,
the
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">WORM</FONT> nor <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">PW</FONT>
nor <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bird</FONT>…nevermore till Betty Ford.&nbsp;
