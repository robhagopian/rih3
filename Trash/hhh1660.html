WHO was thinking about combining a chilly Plunge with a Hash? A momentary lapse of clear thinking cancelled that, as the ice covered river was not very inviting. The trail was marked in both red and blue flour, making a very patriotic sign as WHO didn't like Basket's choice of color and added red to every mark he placed on the frozen snow. <br/><br/>
We started from the parking area for Weetamoo Woods, Lafayette Rd, Tiverton. Working our way along the yellow trail, then south on the cemetary trail to the Pardon Gray Preserve, we were blasted by wind blown snow crossing the field. A good check here had the pack spread out looking for flour, now coverd with a thin layer of the white stuff. A check was found on Main road sending the pack down Seapowet Rd. We worked our way easterly to the Emilie Ruecker Wildlife Refuge on the multi-colored flour pasted on telephone poles. Winding our way along the trails, we found the Beer stop in a marsh overlooking a frozen landscape. Revival's You Thirsty was on tap, but WHO forgot the orange food. There were a few complaints about the pavement, but the Hares took in all in stride.  <br/><br/>
We traveled back to Bill the Beak's for the circle, where the old bugger had a few choice words about the Hare's inviting themselved in just to get out of the cold. The plan was to stay there and order pizza, but as it was New Years Days all the pizza joints nearby were closed. The Hares got their Down Down and sang "It don't smell the way it did before". Backsliders Beak and Y Shitoed drank as well as Fecal. It was Fecal's last Hash before leaving for his new job in FL. Then it was off to 110 Grill in Fall River for the best food we've had in a long time.
