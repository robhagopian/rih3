<p><i><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3">[Sung to a possibly recognizable tune]</font></i></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3">Come and listen to the story of Raging Queen, the hare<br>
Who came from Connecticut, his hashing trail to share.<br>
He promised the RIH3 a shiggy-sort of romp<br>
So he loaded up his truck and he headed for Great Swamp.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>[Spoken, with a Tennessee drawl and a chaw in the left cheek]</i></p>
<p>Muck, that is<br>
Prime Shiggy<br>
Deer ticks.</p>

<p>Well, he set the start along beside the mighty Pawcatuck<br>
It was mighty far from Glendale, but he didn’t give a f*ck.<br>
He hid some beer in bushes (Thank God it wasn’t Bud!)<br>
And he drove to Great Swamp Monument to prove he was a stud.</p>

<p>Phallic, that is<br>
Large Erection<br>
Obelisk</p>

<p>He left his truck and set off east, beginning to lay trail<br>
He knew his “A to B” course soon would lead him to the rail.<br>
He hoped to go through prime shiggy before he reached the train<br>
A pity that the bastard has not even half a brain</p>

<p>Hasher, that is<br>
Drank into insensibility<br>
Presenile dementia</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on back at the start, right near Biscuit City<br>
The hashers were arriving and their moods weren’t very pretty<br>
O where was the hare? It’s well past six-thirty!<br>
Looking for some flour marks, they started to get dirty.</p>

<p>Scouting hash, that is<br>
No marks<br>
Found the beer, at least</p>

<p>Async first, and Oozing, and then WIPOS, always true<br>
Then quite late, the ever-wanking Slasher Dr. W.H.O.<br>
Puff-n-Stuff and his only friend (I can’t recall his name)<br>
Came all the way from Boston (cause their trails are always lame).</p>

<p>Idiots all, that is<br>
Optimists<br>
Doomed to disappointment</p>

<p>After half an hour, in the chilling evening mist<br>
They looked northeast along the trails and started to get pissed<br>
A waving figure running towards them, could it be the hare?<br>
Almost seven thirty and the bastard just got there!</p>

<p>Sweat-soaked, that is<br>
Muddy<br>
Dripping blood</p>

<p>The hare said: “This is sure to be you wankers’ greatest trail!<br>
“Just go up a little ways, right along the rail.<br>
“There will be a little mark, turn left to shiggy-heaven<br>
“It’s somewhere near a powerline marked: 156-47.”</p>

<p>Yeah, right<br>
Trust the hare<br>
Morons</p>

<p>Async led the crew northeast, he was a kindly fella<br>
Always shouting ‘Jump, assholes’ when he saw the next “Acela”<br>
Oozing and WHO followed close with Puff-n-Stuff and friend<br>
WIPOS walked back with the Queen to safely see the end</p>

<p>On On, that is<br>
Miles to go<br>
Deathmarch</p>

<p>After miles of running hard, the leaders found the pole<br>
A path nearby led westward, which they followed at a stroll<br>
For not a mark, no flour did the suffering hashers see<br>
Just a maze of deer paths and some single-ply T.P.</p>

<p>Used, that is<br>
Woods-potty<br>
Does a hasher shit in the woods?</p>

<p>They all decided eventually that this could not be right<br>
The hare had promised shiggy, but he didn’t promise shite<br>
They headed back onto the tracks to see what they could see<br>
A mile back, WIPOS and the hare, laughing heartily</p>

<p>Wrong pole, that is<br>
Oops!<br>
Come on back, y’all</p>

<p>They regrouped by a filthy mire, finally some luck!<br>
The hare went in to find the trail, thigh deep in the muck<br>
He disappeared into the briars and shouted: “Come along!”<br>
The hashers dived into the swamp, and soon they were ‘on on’</p>

<p>T.P. at last, that is<br>
True trail<br>
Not for long</p>

<p>Mud and ticks and briars, poison ivy and swamp gas<br>
Quicksand, vines and unnamed vermin crawling up your ass<br>
In short, the trail was all that any hasher’d like to see<br>
But soon the bloody hare was lost; there was no more T.P.</p>

<p>F*cked, that is<br>
Back to the tracks<br>
Shit!</p>

<p>Async slunk back down the tracks, abandoning the group<br>
“It’s the birthday of my wife,” he said, “My dog has got the croup.”<br>
The rest moved further southwest where the hare had seen a road<br>
The craving for some beer had caused a judgment overload.</p>

<p>Dumb, that is<br>
Even for hashers<br>
Cretins</p>

<p>The road was found, the hare led on, his confidence renewed<br>
I can’t believe the hashers didn’t know that they were screwed.<br>
First north then east then south then west, the hare kept doubling back<br>
Till finally the group came on… the f*cking railroad track!</p>

<p>Enough!, that is<br>
Back to the cars<br>
Beer.</p>

<p>Back they walked along the rails, they sang without a care<br>
Of sexual perversions, and the dickey di do’s hair<br>
They saw among their distant cars a flickering light unsteady<br>
It was the Boston’s KRO and Rhody’s EverReady</p>

<p>Beaver, that is<br>
Conveniently late<br>
Couldn’t find a mark</p>

<p>They all drove to the monument to circle for a while<br>
The hare said: “Follow this path for about an eighth-a-mile”<br>
Twenty furlongs later, they emerged beside the stele<br>
The beer was broached, “The monks…” was sung, the hare began his spiel</p>

<p>Excuses, that is<br>
“How ‘bout that shiggy!”<br>
“Trail of the year”</p>

<p>The ratings were remarkable, it was a “lovely run”<br>
The RIH3’s short of hares, so they declared it fun<br>
The visitors and latecummers, they couldn’t stand his whine<br>
And so the final total was a gentle 6.9</p>

<p>Charity, that is<br>
Ten o’clock<br>
What damn restaurant is open?</p>

<p>On on they drove into the night to Mark’s or Mike’s or Mork’s<br>
Not worried that they all looked like bedraggled dweebs and dorks<br>
They settled in, had food, had beer, they finally quenched their thirst<br>
The queen said “See you later.” They said: “Not if we see you first!”</p>

<p>End, that is<br>
Another hash<br>
Yawn</p>
