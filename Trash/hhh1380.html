Following on a dismal turnout for Dragon Boat races on Saturday and being beaten by cheating bastards, there was still an interest in seeing everyone again even though it was a short time since we had only parted company. The location was only one exit away from the DB races, but the run start was actually held as a closely guarded secret until late Monday when the hares finally figured out that they needed to share this info if the pack was actually going to show up.<br><br>

The parking lot was next to a ball field full of screaming kids, so we could hardly hear Hairy?s explanation as to what ?S? & ?B? & ?C? meant. Briefly, S was a shot stop, B was the usual Beer stop and C was a camera stop for those inclined to take pictures of themselves (no camera was provided). Hairy continued his intro and told us that he had no idea as to where LB was at that time, perhaps she?s lost, I just don?t know.<br><br>

Most of us donned headlamps for the first night time run at this end of the year, the rest promised to keep up with those avec lighting. Trail led us out onto the street, even though we were within spitting distance of some glorious woods. Dr. WHO, him of vast knowledge, decided to shortcut into the woods along with Wee Balls at his side. The rest of us were led by what looked like Lance Armstrong, but it was nun udder than Oozing sporting his bike AND wearing a yellow jacket. Cries of drug user and other obscenities were hurled his way; hence he led us down various incorrect garden paths and made the running distance a lot longer.<br><br>

We meandered through streets broad and narrow in full knowledge of the fact that we would eventually make our way into the heretofore mentioned woods. But, first we were treated to the ?S? stop where we were greeted by a bottle of something that usually requires a prescription. The stench of the root beer schnapps was so vile as to make one?s teeth hurt, others not perturbed by said stench actually refused to take the stuff out of the paper bag for fear of being labeled a drug user or something like that. At this point Async decided to move on and avoided the pond crossing by using the bridge; Just Shaymus took the water route as did several others. <br><br>

Oozie was last seen riding along highway but veered off into some bushes after hearing the cries of the local kids mimicking us with their ?Are you on-On, mister?. Finally, we hit the woods running by practice sessions for future soccer stars and standabout Baseball players, WHO could care less about the ?C? mark that lay ahead and SheMale led us on in search of the beer. We were now shouting backwards to try and get PG and Crotchy to catch up with us, and they did so as we arrived at the shitty beer stop. Hairy and LB had steered us on a long bad trail and made us double back to the beer, by now it was getting dark and the lights came on for the first time. The usual chatter happened at the B, songs were sung and time slid by. Next thing you know we are on some kind of Butt Plug trail leading back to the cars, the circle was held in the bushes and a wee bit into the comments portion we were greeted by the presence of WIPOS for the first time. Overall run rating changed with this late arrival and it turned into a positive something, which in my mind makes for some very strange math. The Virgins made it to the circle, and the moment of the evening happened when returnee, Crotch Tiger, had to question herself. She had a problem getting composed, breaking into laughter whilst trying to cum up with questions in her head then she followed it up by not knowing the answers to her own questions ? definitely a hasher!! Hashit went to Rusty, again, because he writes this trash.<br><br>

On-on was held at some pub in a shopping mall, where Oozie virtually lost his shirt when he (won/lost ?) the bet about Andy Murray winning the tennis match ? the prize was Oozie buying cans of Guinness for everyone. A tall order, well filled.<br><br>
