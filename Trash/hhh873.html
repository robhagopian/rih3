<p>Like the late Reverend, I too had a dream! I had a dream 
of a perfectly marked trail, when the rhody hash stalwarts would forget to cum 
out on a Monday night and in their place a half dozen 
scantily-clad-beer-chugging nymphets singing and dancing to the fresh sounds of 
the sitar, and in place of the infernal seemingly never-ending Mon Night 
Football, would be telecast heart-pumping and leather-thumping cricket much to 
the chagrin of an intellectually challenged citizenry.</p>

<p>The truth lies somewhere in between, for altho' twas a 
perfectly laid trail, the aforementioned stalwarts did indeed show up. The 
Million Man however presumably marched onwards and rumour has it were sighted at 
the Warwick CCRI campus, where they proceeded to recite the Koran, throw Molotov 
cocktails at every moving object and chant anti-semitism slogans all in the name 
of peace and Islam. In response, a million miles away a certain army grazed a 
couple of suspect homes to the ground. The home belonged to a certain 
self-proclaimed Bodhisattva who brewed a wicked holy drink and possibly, by the 
sight of the equipment, ecstasy. Luckily, the deity was away preaching( some say 
moaning and groaning with much profanity) in middle America. But we 
digress...what is this? A <font color="#FF0000">DrWHO</font> write-up?!</p>

<p>Talking of whom, it appears he remains stupefied by his 
xmas gift and is overcome by its intoxicating smell, er, taste.
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> set a fine trail indeed. It meandered into 
the woods circling away from the college, far into the depths of wild nature 
away from homo sapiens habitat (yes,and away from <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> 
too), with encounters with all sorts of wildlife. Up cliffs and into valleys. 
Deep into Lincoln into territory hitherto undiscovered by this hash. And to 
commemorate Capt Cooks crossing of the Antarctic this day in 1773, and 
subsequent discovery of Antarctica in 1840 by the Russians, the hare led the 
pack over a just frozen lake Olney. The lake groaned underneath the weight of
<font color="#FF0000">Wipos</font> 3 layered GoreTex clothing, but the pack made 
it across not once but twice and into the beer check. Strangers attempted to 
follow the pack, but as <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> warmed himself with his own flatulence, they made 
a hasty retreat and called the local Guard fearing an Iraqi-led chemical attack.</p>

<p>What a hash!! Now had <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
set the run, well one can only guess he would take the pack on a never-ending 
run 'neath power-lines, with less than three marks and leave the hash to fend 
for themselves. And to think the hare would ask the aging marine to fill in for 
him. Lucky for us!! The ONIN, once again convened to that fine establishment, 
the Lodge. The pack instinctively broke into the Gloria Gaynor tune I Will 
Survive that topped the charts this week in 1979, no doubt finding the interior 
70 degrees more hospitable than the outdoors 0 below. <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> favoured the vegetarian dish which sent the kitchen personnel in a 
frenzy and outdoors to pluck any surviving wild cabbage from the swamp behind.
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> relied on popcorn for sustenance instead. 
Guinness was enjoyed by all and with a joint prayer for no more 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> hashes, 
the pack retired into the cold, misty night....</p>

<p>OnOn,</p>
