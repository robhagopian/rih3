<p><i>Editor’s Note: In solidarity with the writer’s strike in the entertainment industry, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO
</font> has refused to write the trash for this run. <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> has provided notes and 
the <font color="#FF0000">Bodhisattva Bondo Jovi</font> himself has agreed to perform the duties, even though he was not 
present.</i></p>

<p>I wish to say that RIH3 is loosing the ability to remain a good and vibrant hash. recent events have made me question 
why would I want to run or walk with this shitty hash. first of all the pavement is made for cars and not for runners 
second the run should be over by 8pm in order to get to an on on on timely fashion. third <font color="#FF0000">basket's
</font> runs are the most pathetic and long for nothing runs that last till 9pm and then some. forth <font color="#FF0000">
Dr. WHO</font> is trying to be like <font color="#FF0000">basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">asynk</font> is trying 
to be like <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. fifth <font color="#FF0000">Ooozing</font> is trying to dress like 
<font color="#FF0000">wipos</font>. well i could to go and on but rih3 use to be the best hash in the state now the 
<font color="#FF0000">bodisavett</font> has druoghts. Irregardlessly, I am doing this fucken writeup because that lasy 
basturd <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> said he would buy some of my beer if I did so here goes…</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Justinmyass</font> is reely a true asswipe so why no one expected this kind of fuckup is beyond 
me  when he was hare which is mostly why i stayed in wonsocket of course, being all-knowing i knew what was up… but a 
whole bunch of assos came…not reelly… to heritage park including another virgin just kat who was dragged along by her hair 
or something else by <font color="#FF0000">just zeke</font>. Trail led out into the woods which might be a good start but 
the fucken hare said there were two turkey-eagle splits which is planning like a moron if you ask me… The first one came 
up soon… after crossing a river and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went off 
together to have some gay time together on the eagle trail while trying to get just haines and just sean to go off some 
other way… the bimbos were stucked with the hare until the two groups came together again for the last fucken time on this 
shit trail…</p>

<p>There was a whole lot of bush whacking now and of course the <font color="#FF0000">bodisavett</font> likes bush and he 
likes whacking but he would have been disappointed as the group now got split up halv the time on paths and halv the time 
in the briars, crossing beaver brook with no fucken beevers to say the least… there were fucken arrows every wich way so’s 
that whenever you came out of the bushes onto a trail, a fucken arrow would tell you to go the wrong way…we all know 
<font color="#FF0000">basket</font> doesn’t follow arrows he doesn’t even see them probly… so he and <font color="#FF0000">
Concrete</font> and maybe <font color="#FF0000">Eenie-weenie</font> were off one way while <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>
 and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> led donkey and pubic another way and the rest of the bimbos were with the just 
boys…and everyone was looking for the sheperd’s hut not that that would help… there were a lot of fucken lights floating 
around in this shit sandwich I’ll tell you… the hare had left, and maybe gave wipos a hint as well, the dickhead…</p>

<p>They finally got fed up so’s <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> got out his boyscout compass and said I’m heading 
northnorthwest by east or somesuch shite so the resyt of the wankers decided to follow him except of course <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> who was happy to be lost with someone close to his age concrete I mean…<font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> led his group out to some lights which of course were a backyard and they all got through without anyone 
getting some rock-salt in the ass or even hearing a siren…what are these fucken people, chickenshit? or what… they were 
now out on pavement on rt44 turning left when what should appear but another fucken arrow! This trail reellly sucked.</p>

<p>This was no wonsocket pavement either, it hurt the knees and so they were all gonna just head back to the cars but some 
overachiever saw another fucken aroow! and turned left again to find a playground, a hare and a wipos… drinking the fucken 
beer. And of course everyone fucken made it to the beer probably smelling the hare or something…everyone except <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrtete</font> of course but spent that much time in the woods alone with <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> and anyone can get pretty fucked up…so they had their shit beer and sang some fucken songs and finally headed back 
to the cars…</p>

<p>Ok they circled and as usual without <font color="#FF0000">Bondojovi</font> there to give accurate ratings they came up 
with a <b>-6.9</b> or something…but I’ll give you the revelation of truth…it was a lovley run. Hashit went to <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> cause <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> has been getting too attached to <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> toy if you know what I mean, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> has had to extract it in the 
operating room to or three times already…so they finished up and decided to go to Chester’s for the on on on… a bad 
decision at least for <font color="#FF0000">Just Sean</font> who got caught speeding and probly is just kooling his heels 
in the pokey right about now…they did the usual shit with food in the beer and their not inviting the rih3 back to 
chester’s any fucken time soon I can bet or at least they’ll lock up the oyster crackers from now on…</p>
