<p><font color="#0000FF">Title and Theme:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat's</font> world is a world of extremes. Happiness often lies too close to sorrow, new 
life is too closely connected with death, joy is followed by disaster too quickly, so much that one wonders how anyone can 
remain optimistic in such circumstances. It is a world for people for whom hashing life is very important, but who also 
constantly worries about the dangers that threaten the safety of the hash. Extreme feminism is one of its most dangerous 
threats.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Setting:</font></p>
<p>The story is set at Snake Den Park and at the Dame Farm, the farm of <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, both in 
Rhode Island. Some important events take place in Burrilleville and Bishop Hill Tavern. The story actually begins in 1967, 
when <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> is negative 7 years old. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> is born 
in 1967 and dies…<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows when.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Summary:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat’s</font> hashing mentor, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, hates wankers 
chasing bimbos. In 1969, when a hasher reaches under her kilt, she wounds him with a scalpel. She is a hasher with RIH3 
where many hash casualties occur. Here she nurses hasher <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, who has lost nearly 
all his mental faculties and who is slowly dying of too much beer. <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> uses him to 
make herself pregnant. Her daughter she calls <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font> accepts a job as Grand Master at Hashing School and there <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> grows 
up. <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> becomes an inveterate hasher. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat's</font> 
ear is partly bitten off by Ben, the dog belonging to the <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> family. <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> is generally disliked. He refuses to have Ben put down and this is the beginning of a long 
feud between <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> and the <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> family. When, at 
the age of fifteen, <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> has to choose a sport, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover
</font> happens to be at a hash, where she watches the wankers. Their hare is <font color="#FF0000">Amish It Head</font>, 
who has recently come east in order to give his daughter <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> a better education. He never 
realized that girls were not allowed at RIH3.</p>

<p>The only thing <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> knows about her mother is that she is a hasher, and when she sees 
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> she at once embraces her and calls her mother.  <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font> registers <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> for hashing and <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat
</font> often meets <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> at the hash. When <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> tells <font 
color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> that she will only marry a hasher, she decides at that moment to become one.</p>

<p>During her graduation year <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> sends <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> her 
first story, which she does not like. That same year <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> tries to seduce <font 
color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font>, but he appears to know nothing about sex. <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> 
decides to take <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> to Burrilleville after her graduation, but before leaving she 
tries to finish with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> where she had to stop before. Taking her to the infirmary during 
the night, she meets Ben, gets into a fight and bites off part of the dog's ear. In Burrilleville, <font color="#FF0000">
Trail Hoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> move from one hashhouse to another before settling down 
in a rented apartment (somewhere on Snake Hill Rd). <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> has to be her mentor's 
guide, because she speaks no German (<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> does?). She wants to write a book, but does not 
know how to start a story. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> only writes to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. 
<font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> become interested in 
<font color="#FF0000">Franz “Boom Boom” Grillparzer</font>, an unimportant Austrian writer, and they discover his name 
everywhere.  She decides to use the name in the title of her first major story, a story about a hasher who is employed to 
inspect bimbos and pubs, but who uses his whole hash chapter to carry out this task. When <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> meet some (man)whores, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover
</font> wants to talk to one of them about lust. Afterwards <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> regularly meets 
this man, <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill</font>, who is much older than she is.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover’s</font> writing goes faster since she has decided on the title 'A Sexual Suspect'. 
<font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> in the meantime meets some American hashers and finds out afterwards that she 
has contracted a venereal disease. Also the (man)whore <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill</font> is suffering from such a 
disease and <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> visits him in a very expensive clinic where he dies shortly after. 
After his death she goes back to work on 'The Pension Grillparzer'. When <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> 
finishes her book she sends it to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for her opinion. After fifteen months <font 
color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> return to hashing. After reading <font 
color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat's</font> story, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> marries her. They have already arranged 
that <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> will take charge of the housework after the birth of their first child, 
who is a boy called <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover’s</font> book 'A Sexual 
Suspect' is an enormous success.' When her father dies she takes care of her mother and the house becomes a centre for 
women in trouble, who see in <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> a last resort. One of her companions belongs to the 
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> movement. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> is a 10-year-old girl who has hashed and 
had lost her virginity. As a protest against what happened to <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, these hashers also have 
lost their virginity.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat's</font> first novel, Procrastination, about Burrilleville in the years 2005-2006, 
is published and receives favourable reviews. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> have a second son, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> writes a 
second novel, called Second Wind of the Cuckold, of which the success is slightly smaller than that of her first novel, 
and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> takes on a second job as a professor of English.</p>

<p>Their friends, Seamus and Ben, have marital problems and the result of attempts to help them are that for a time 
<font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> is involved with Seamus and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> with Ben.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> introduces her latest companion, <font color="#FF0000">Roberta “Boom Boom” 
Muldoon</font>, formerly <font color="#FF0000">Robert “Basket” Muldoon</font>, a famous football player, and now <font 
color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover’s</font> bodyguard. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> often worries about her 
children and when <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> wants to spend the night with a friend, whose mother <font 
color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> does not like, he tries to persuade him to stay at home. When the woman visits him, 
she clearly offers herself and feels insulted when <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> turns her down. <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> has gone to her house all the same and <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> wants him 
out of it, as he thinks the woman is mad. He decides to go to the house and finds it in a disgusting state. The woman is 
obviously drunk and asks him to rid her of something upstairs. The something turns out to be a boy in her bedroom and 
<font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> has to use her trail-finding techniques to get him out. Once more the woman 
tries to seduce him, but he decides to carry the sleeping <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> home.</p>

<p>One day <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> hears that <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> has died in childbirth 
and he phones <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> wife to offer her condolences. She is not aware that <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> died several months ago, and his phone call gets through on the day that Ben finally dies, 
and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> wife thinks that this is one of <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat’s</font> cruel 
jokes.</p>

<p>At home <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> finds <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> reading a story by one of 
her students, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, and detects a guilty look on her face. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS
</font> is <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat’s</font> opposite in every way and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> has 
fallen for him. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> wants her to read one of his stories, thinking that this would 
attract her towards him again. This story is called Vigilance and is about a hasher who is obsessed with beer in the 
suburb where he lives. After reading it <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> indeed loves <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er 
Squat</font> very much, although she does not like the story.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> often panics when one of the children catches a mere cold. She has nightmares 
during which she finds herself unable to wake up one of her sons. On a cold, snowy day one of <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS's</font> former fashion advisors informs <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> that <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> is involved with <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. When <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> gets home, <font 
color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> makes believe she is drowning herself, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
realises that she knows about her and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. She assures him that it is all over now. <font 
color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> takes the kids to the pictures and tells <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to phone 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and break off with him. In spite of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font> protests, 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> drives over to her house and in his car they quarrel.</p>

<p>As he is unable to reach <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> on the phone, <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> 
races home despite very bad visibility. She crashes into <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS's</font> Saab and in this accident 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> is killed and <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> badly injured, so <font color="#FF0000">
Trail Hoover</font> becomes a hasher again. The <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> family moves into her house. 
With the whole family slowly improving, <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> feels like writing again. She and <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> have come closer together since the accident, although thoughts of the accident still 
disturb them when they are together. In her new novel <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> puts all her grief. The 
story 'The World According to Bensenhaver' is in fact the first chapter of her new novel. The subject is hashing and the 
reactions of the victim and of the investigating police officer.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat's</font> publisher, dislikes the story 
so much that he does not want to publish it. When <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> insists, he publishes it in a 
pornographic magazine. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> still feels this reluctance when the novel is finished, but 
does publish it after all.</p>

<p>The <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> family goes on holiday to Burrilleville in order to recover fully. Here, 
late one night they receive a telephone call that <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, who has entered politics, has 
been shot by an anti-hasher man. Her funeral is to be the first hasher funeral in New York. Not even <font color="#FF0000">
Saw’er Squat</font> is allowed to be present, so <font color="#FF0000">Roberta “Boom Boom” Muldoon</font> dresses her in 
hash clothes. But in spite of hers disguise <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> is recognised by <font 
color="#FF0000">Snotty</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> younger sister, who accuses him of having murdered her 
sister. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> can only run away, chased by some hashers. On the plane to Boston, she 
meets <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, who writes a note that she has lost both her shoes, and that she had been on 
her way to see <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>. Now <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> tells her that she 
can stay with her family.</p>

<p>At Burrilleville, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> tells <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> that both <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font> father and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> have just died. After the funerals the 
<font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> family decides to stay at Burrilleville, where <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> will teach and <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> will be the hare. They have another child, a daughter, 
called <font color="#FF0000">Great at Giving Head</font>. In her will <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> has 
appointed <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> to be the executioner of her last wishes. As a consequence her house 
is turned into a Foundation supporting hashers with all sorts of problems. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> wants 
to make an exception for the <font color="#FF0000">Tinkers</font>, whom she considers insane. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker
</font> even writes an article about these hashers, because she, too, thinks they are not behaving in a normal way. The 
reactions that <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> receives to this article infuriate <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat
</font>, who strongly attacks them in a written reply. The situation becomes explosive when two <font color="#FF0000">
Tinkers</font> try to run <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> down with their car, but she escapes and the hashers 
are killed when the car hits a wall. In the meantime <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat's</font> son <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> has become quite a good artist and when <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat's</font> first story is 
reprinted, her son illustrates it.</p>

<p>One morning <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> talks about writing to her favourite hasher <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>. Writing means to <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> trying to keep everyone alive. 
That same day a hasher enters the hash where <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> is the hare, walks up to her and 
shoots her. In her final moments <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> recognises in her attacker a <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>. She is thirty-three when she dies. The hasher turns out to be <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font>, who has recently run out of beer.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> lives to be quite old and never remarries. <font color="#FF0000">Roberta “Boom 
Boom” Muldoon</font> looks after <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> becomes a 
hasher. <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> outlives all the others and becomes a doctor.</p>

<p><br><font color="#0000FF">Things that struck me during hashing:</font></p>
<p>A thing that struck me, was the fact that <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> describes certain things, that come across 
the hash later in a very detailed way. Like the gear-shift-shaft, which misses its top, so it's quite sharp. Many checks 
further, in a car accident, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> falls with his eye into the shaft, he loses one eye.</p>

<p><br><font color="#0000FF">Most exciting mile:</font></p>
<p>In the hash there isn't just one especially exciting mile, that points out. But if I had to chose one of them I think 
I'll chose the one in which <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> speeds up the driveway, the engine stalled and the 
headlights out, and runs into to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS’s</font> Saab:<br><br>

(page 350) '<font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> hit the bottom of her driveway at about forty miles per hour she 
came of the downhill road in third gear and accelerated just as he exited; she glimpsed how the driveway was glazed with 
frozen slush, and worried momentarily that the Subaru might slip on the short uphill curve. She held the car in gear until 
he felt what grip he had of the road; it was good enough, and she popped the sharp stick shift into neutral - a second 
before she killed the engine and flicked out the headlights.<br><br>

They coasted up, into the black rain. It was like that moment when you feel an airplane lift off the runway; the children 
both cried out in excitement. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> could feel the children at her elbow, crowding 
each other for the one favoured position in the gap between the bucket seats.<br><br>

'How can you see now?' <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> asked.<br><br>

'She doesn't have to see,' <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> said. There was a high thrill in <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi's</font> voice, which suggested to <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> that <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi
</font> wished to reassure himself.<br><br>

'I know this by heart,' <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> assured them.  It was, after all, Snake Den.<br><br>

'It's like being underwater!' cried <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>; he held his breath afraid of shiggy.<br><br>

'It's like a dream!' said <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>; he reached for his brother's hand for “we’re all queers 
together!”<br><br>

This is the end of chapter 13 (<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> catches a cold) and in the beginning of chapter 14 
(The World According to Marcus Aurelius) <font color="#FF0000">Amish It Head</font> tells us how the <font 
color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> family will recover after the hash, which is described two paragraphs further.</p>

<p>In this hash <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> gets killed, which is described in the end of the chapter. <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> loses one eye. <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat</font> has a broken jaw and twelve 
stitches in her tongue, so had to write messages like the <font color="#FF0000">Tinkers</font>, which she hated. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> needed two stitches in her tongue; broke to teeth and suffered neck aches for the rest of 
her live. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> lost three-quarter is of his penis.  'It's like a dream!' were the last 
words <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> said. But it turned out to be a nightmare.<br><br>

<p><br><font color="#0000FF">My own opinion:</font></p>
<p>The hash had everything a hash needs in my opinion. There were lots of funny parts but there were also the emotionally 
parts. Dramatic parts quickly followed funny parts. It was an easy trail to run, because there were not many difficult 
checks, and if there were difficult checks, you could get the direction of the trail out of the distant horns.</p>

<p>My favourite hasher was <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. He has, as a little child, an other look on the world 
than the elderly people, he also uses other words for things, like the Under Toad: <font color="#FF0000">Saw’er Squat
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> warned the children of the undertow of the sea, it would drag them into 
the sea and drown them, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> thought there was a gigantic toad under the water that would 
drag him under the water and drown him if wasn't paying attention.</p>

<p>The passages between <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> were often funny.</p>
