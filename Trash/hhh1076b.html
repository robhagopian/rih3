<p>Basket</font>.</p>

<p>In keeping with the theme of inexperienced hares making the hash suffer through miles of pavement, this week’s hare 
more than lived up to the bargain. Starting from Box Seats in Smithfield, there wasn’t a lot he could do, perhaps. But 
note to hares: it is better to reuse some woods, than to set an asphalt marathon. At any rate, the hash set off promptly 
at the appointed hour. Surprisingly, trail was picked up on the path along the reservoir, heading west then north.</p>

<p>The reservoir path was pleasant. Frequent swampy areas and a little bushwhacking made for some enjoyment for those on 
trail, led by <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> stuck to an inner path. <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> promptly got lost. The trail made the most of the shiggy before coming out to the first Beer Check, at a 
loading dock between two warehouses.  Been there, done that. But at least <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> were missing. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
arrived. So much for that positive mark.</p>

<p>Onwards they went, beginning the long and arduous trek on the macadam. North on Farnum Pike, northeast and uphill on 
Brayton Road, east on Rogler Farm Road; it’s almost to painful to revisit in memory. They turned right on Rt 7. Trail 
would have to lead into Bryant College. It didn’t. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went in, anyways. The rest stuck 
with the hare. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> were still missing. There were 
certainly no marks to follow, that’s for sure. Passing Parente’s, the group knew that the hare must have chosen the 
powerlines, as the only alternative would have been to stay on pavement and take 116 back. This would have resulted in 
certain death for the hare. So they turned in, and picked up the marks a few yards in on the powerlines.</p>

<p>These powerlines are possibly the most overused powerlines in RI. Every dip, every rise, every puddle and every briar 
is well-known to any hasher that has run with the RIH3 for more than a few months. The hare, carrying the beer from the 
first check, called an impromptu BC #2. What imagination! But at least this time they were left alone by <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, wandering somewhere on Bryant’s campus. So after lightening the load a bit more, they 
continued south, and came out at 116. They turned right. They ran the pavement back to Rt 5. They turned right. They ran 
the pavement back to Box Seats. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was waiting for them.</p>

<p>The circle was short but not sweet. The run was rated. Lack of virgin territory, lack of shiggy, sustained pavement and 
lack of bimbo’s could not be made up for by two beer checks, loss of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> (and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>), and incompetent markings. Total: <b>-6.9</b>. Hashit: the choice was clearly between <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> won (lost)! 
On On On was rapidly moved to Effin’s once the owner of Box Seats came out to investigate the crew. And from Effin’s, a 
groundswell of sentiment forced the migration to Parente’s in search of the tight-pants waitresses. They were missing. 
But <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> and <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> 
still managed to move in on some bimbos at the bar. The less said about that, the better.</p>
