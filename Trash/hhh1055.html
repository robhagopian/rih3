<p><font color="#008000">Run #1055</font>, June 19, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; East Providence/Seekonk</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Clear, Low 80’s</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr W.H.O., Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, Amish It Head, Dry Foot Fairy, 
Mrs. WIPOS, Seamus, Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> trails are unique. He is no stranger to swamps. (Run <a href="hhh1001.html" 
target="new">#1001</a>.) In his usual garb, he is impervious to briars, thorns and poison ivy; he does not hesitate to 
incorporate these elements into his runs. (Run <a href="hhh812.html" target="new">#812</a>.)  He also enjoys long and 
meaningless false trails. (Run <a href="hhh772.html" target="new">#772</a>.) He is fond of idiosyncratic marking schemes. 
(Run <a href="hhh880.html" target="new">#880</a>.) He sees no particular virtue in using virgin territory. (See all 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> Runs!) And he is not worried about overuse of asphalt. (Run <a href="hhh884.html" 
target="new">#884</a>.) In fact the one common result of a <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> run is that it is sure to 
Annoy. Greatly. With a capital “A”. This run was no exception.</p>

<p>The trail started from the ballfields on Rt. 114 in East Providence (See Runs <a href="hhh922.html" 
target="new">#922</a>, <a href="hhh812.html" target="new">#812</a>). The few arrivals looked hopefully at each car pulling 
into the lot. But there was a softball game starting, and only five hashers were present. The hare’s car was empty, and 
after <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> broke in and no beer was found, the group reluctantly acknowledged that it was 
6:30. Fluorescent green squares stapled to trees were apparently the mark of choice. Led by <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>, they turned into the woods. Immediately, they bushwhacked through a swamp. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
decided to forgo this and walked around the perimeter of the fields. He was soon joined by <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font> as trail came back out. A worthless loop! Tell me that’s not annoying!</p>

<p>Circling the edge of the fields counterclockwise to the north, they eventually turned back in and headed generally 
east. More swamp was encountered. Now the swamp was interspersed with briars, and what could be the largest and most 
profuse growth of poison ivy in the state of Rhode Island. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> found the first stream crossing, and they led through the waist high Ten Mile River. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> followed. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> took one look, and 
turned back. Things were looking up. But, he left his dog with the hashers. Annoying moment #2!</p>

<p>The trail led through a maze of semi-paths, briars and more poison ivy, before crossing the river again. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> found the opportunity to cross a third and fourth time 
on a falsie. <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> horn remained ahead, and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> wisely 
chose the poison ivy trail heading east. Finally, they all came out together to find the hare, in a clearing just south of 
Hunt’s Mill. With all the recent rain, the Ten Mile River had transformed into the Ten Mile Cataract at this spot. The 
point chosen for crossing was clearly impassable. But the hare called the group south with his horn, and then led the way 
across at a small island which shallowed and split the torrent. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed and was directed 
south along the stream on a path that led out to the streets. Ben required restraint. Especially when trail led across the 
busy Rt. 44. That’s pretty annoying, too (although you can’t blame the hare completely).</p>

<p>On the opposite side of 44, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> found trail continuing south on Lynn Street. The group 
lost marks briefly. The hare called them back to a well-hidden mark turning them right, and through a vegetable garden 
into a marsh with a prolonged stand of phragmites. There was no path. Only occasionally was a fluorescent green square 
found, precariously attached to a cattail. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tried his own route. He could not be seen. 
But he could be tracked both by sound and smell. No quicksand was encountered, and for the first time there was no poison 
ivy. And the water never got above mid-shin. Luxury! But all good things must end. They came to a cobblestone quarry. The 
loosely piled stones offered the (futile) hope that Ben or <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> would get buried alive in 
an avalanche. <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and the hare wisely entered the 
quarry and walked to the next mark while <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
struggled along at the edge of the massive loose stone pile. Trail was recovered, and turned east. They emerged on Rt 114A 
at the Massage Parlor. The hare had made no advance arrangements. All were annoyed.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led south on 114A. He knew what was next (See Run <a href="hhh772.html" target="new">
#811</a>.): the little known Nature Preserve opposite Tort’s. Sure enough, the irritating fluorescent green squares led 
into the preserve. Now this preserve has some lovely paths, a pond, a small stream. It is quite idyllic. But there is one 
area. An obscure central swamp, choked with briars and poison ivy. Guess where trail led. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
should know better than to follow trail here! After all, there’s only a few ways out of this preserve. But, hoping against 
hope that beer was near, they continued southwest into the muck.  Emerging briefly into some fields, they skirted the edge 
of a horse paddock, and climbed down, back into shiggy. Finally, they came out on Leonard Street, and ran back to 114A. 
Another worthless loop.  And no beer yet! F**ing annoying!</p>

<p>The third phase of this trail commenced. This was bad news. Your scribe does not wish to annoy you further with the 
woeful trail of pavement and tears that led from 114A to County Street, under 195, and up Rt. 6, under the Wampanoag 
Trail, past on-ramps, and tractor trailers, on shoulders and through construction zones finally entering the neighborhoods 
on Moorland. Or the tale of the trek through the subdivisions past confused homeowners, barking dogs and alcoholic 
housewives from Moorland to Rice to Clyde past Kent Heights Playground (Run <a href="hhh7760-something.html" target="new">
#760-something</a>.) to Gardiner, and finally to #10 Gardiner, and the home of the hare. The beer stop was guarded by the 
hare’s wife, who visibly cringed when she saw the hare (or was it <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>?) So your scribe 
will not describe these things. But, the prosecution rests.</p>

<p>The beer was another eccentric collection of Magic Hat offerings or Long Trail or something equally annoying. There was 
a fire (most useful in the humid, 85 degree heat). But the hare provided some Tecnu to attempt to reverse the worst of the 
poison ivy, and the smoke from the fire did somewhat discourage the mosquitoes. It was assumed that <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> would have long since departed, so they finished their beers and agreed to circle back at the cars. The hare 
and <font color="#FF0000">Mrs. WIPOS</font> drove <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot
</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> took Ben and Seamus, and began to run 
back. They thought someone might drive out and rescue them. Ha! Back at the start, the auto-hashers met… <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>! He was asked to drive out and rescue his dog and the others. But he was dry. He was not 
about to leave the cooler that he saw in the hare’s car. Finally, the runners arrived. Now, that’s annoying!</p>

<p>They circled up in the woods at the start of the trail. The run was rated: no beer vs briars, pavement vs poison ivy, 
roads vs rivers. It was difficult to come to a consensus. But the increasingly voracious mosquitoes and the lack of 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> ultimately decided the issue. Total: 
<b>+0.69</b>. Hashit was only briefly discussed. And given to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Or <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> cares? They beat a hasty retreat (Bad retreat! Bad!) to the Red Bridge 
Tavern (See runs <a href="hhh989.html" target="new">#989</a>, <a href="hhh922.html" target="new">922</a>, <a 
href="hhh884.html" target="new">884</a>, <a href="hhh812.html" target="new">812</a>, <a href="hhh804.html" target="new">
804</a>,…). But at least they avoided karaoke night at Tort’s. The word “annoying” wouldn’t come close!</p>
