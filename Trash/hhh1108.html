<p><font color="#008000">Run #1108</font>, Jun 25, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; JIMA</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; North Scituate, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; ~80, sunny</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish Ithead, Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Just John, Basket Boom Boom, Dr. WHO, 
Oozing, Just Holly, Dryfoot Fairy, Seamus, Ben.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>After hearing about all experiencing a good workout at last week’s brilliant hash in North Kingston, <font 
color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> thought he’d counter with one of the shortest runs on record.  It took just a tad over 10 min 
to get the beer check!  And even in the 80 degree heat everyone (minus <font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> boobs) barely 
broke a sweat.</p>

<p>With the long-anticipated, but unexpected, return of <font color="#FF0000">Dryfoot Fairy</font> we could only hope for 
a wonderful event.  A run with ticks, rivers, brush and cold, delicious, thirst-quenching beer.  But this was not to be.  
The group assembled at Manning Field in North Scituate with expectations low and beer bellies empty.</p>

<p>The hare arrived last-second with the only positive feature of this hash in tow (<font color="#FF0000">Just Holly
</font>) leaving an arrow out due south past the ball fields and into the woods.  A quick check had <font color="#FF0000">
Amish</font> going right and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> leading left, on 
true trail.  A quick return had Amish rounding up the rear not far from <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dryfoot</font> chattin’ it up like a bunch of ladies.  Once into the woods an arrow lead left up a fairly 
steep sandy hillclimb and then east to a slight downhill.  With <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just John</font> easily cruising out to a lead the rest in the rear could hear (and 
see) them loop back around to the sandhill.  Not wanting, or needing, to do that again <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
made a 180 and met the others back on trail downhill leading towards the ballfield.  <font color="#FF0000">Dryfoot</font>, 
trying to overachieve to make up for all the runs he’s missed in the past few months followed true trail and made a second 
ascent up the hill.  A few puddles, a few patches of moss and 10min 32sec after the start we were at the beer check.  That 
is if you call Honey Brown beer.  But there were spicy Doritos and as mentioned earlier, <font color="#FF0000">Just Holly
</font>, so we had that going for us.</p>

<p>With some songs sung and the “beer” gone best bet was to head back to the cars and to the Bishop Hill Tavern for food 
and real drinks.  At the back end of the parking lot we encountered not one, not two, but three fire trucks.  Apparently 
they were conducting a training search and rescue and after seeing we were ok decided to move on.  Good thing, as there 
was barely enough “beer” for us, yet alone all of those wanks!  With <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> having alone time back at the Vanogan (hey – they had to burn off all that energy unused by 
the hash somehow!) the circle moved along quickly and shortly.  Just like the hash!  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> 
knows what the comments were, it couldn’t have been much based on the short time we were on an actual “trail.”  What I do 
know was that the rating ended up being a <b>-69</b>, far too generous in my opinion!  Hashit went to <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> (after his return to the group following finishing with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>) 
for confusingly putting on more Kevlar, Gore-Tex and other high-tech clothing for the circle than the actual run.</p>

<p>A quick trip up 6 to the Bishop Hill Tavern had us orally pleasuring (via song, how else!?) our waitress Laura, and 
making a new, yet scary friend.  A new friend that made <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> wonder if he was going to leave 
the tavern alive.  The hare must have worn himself out putting together that trail as he and <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Holly</font> didn’t make it.  We only missed <font color="#FF0000">Just Holly</font>.  With trails like this, is it any 
wonder that <font color="#FF0000">Dryfoot</font> doesn’t show up anymore?  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> knows!?</p>
