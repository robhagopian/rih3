<p><font color="#008000">Run #926</font> January 12, 2004</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location: </font>North Smithfield, at a Weigh Station and Gay Rendezvous on Rt 146 South<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather: </font>High 20's, Clearing from a light Snow<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi, The Slasher Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, Oozing 
Syphilitic Dicktaphone, Summer's Eve Seven Year B*tch, WIPOS</font>, Seamus, Ben and Jake.<br><br>
The Run:</font></p>

<p>It only gets more pathetic, week after week. And this hare should be renamed &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Fuwanker</font>
&quot;! From the dual-lane weigh station at the powerline intersection, trail led bushwacking south east, initially 
parallel to 146, then turning more south up the hill, through some minor swamp, with a few zigs and zags back west to the 
powerlines. Marks were pink or white flour on trees, pink flour on the snow, or the hares size 17 boot prints, at least 
until the dogs trashed the trail.<br><br>

A long and pointless trek on the powerlines WSW, with annoying but worthless checks that favored the mentally-challenged 
(<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>) who became FRBs by simply ignoring (or, more 
likely, missing) the checks and bulling straight ahead, while <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> got some exercise going on lateral falsies.  But the wankers blew past 
the BC, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>in particular heading off towards Cady's, while the rest climbed to the crest 
of Whortleberry Hill for beer.<br><br>

The Beer was a Winter Ale and a Wheat beer. What are we coming to? It hardly seemed worth it to try to finish it all before 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> realized the error of his ways and returned.<br><br>

Ater the beer, trail continued WSW on the powerlines down the hill and then south on a dirt road to a check which had: 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> saying &quot;F*ck this&quot; and heading back on the powerlines to the cars, <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> bushwhacking off trail south,<font color="#FF0000"> 
Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> hanging back suspecting the hare was up to something and ending up 
heading southeast into a car graveyard and &quot;Deliverance&quot; country, and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> on true 
trail, a giant circle jerk back to the powerlines. Another waste of a Monday night, and they all eventually straggled back 
ENE on the powerlines to circle up near the cars.<br><br>

Ratings for the Run: 0.69, mainly because of a pungent odor at the circle courtesy of one of the dogs (or <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, no one could tell)!<br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">Hashit:</font> Dr WHO, for following Basket and admitting to reading a map before the Hash (take a 
look in <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>'s car some time, you wanks!)<br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">On On On:</font> The Lodge in Lincoln, $18 per, including the cost of flying french fries.</p>
