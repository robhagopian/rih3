<font color="#3333FF"><i>The Run:</i></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, the d'erctions were nearly a-okay 'cept the
last half. After passing the park,&nbsp; which was named different to what the
hare told us and U-ing, I found the hare in the park sitting and reading (or at
least pretending). When informed that his d'erections will have everyone lost,
he exclaimed &quot;Sod them all!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, having asked a virgin to cum, I therefore
went outside the park and waited there (also the park gates were to close after
dark) and here <font color="#FF0000">Flushy</font> drove by and thinking me lost
(nothing new) came and chatted. One by one, the wanks showed up and thought me
lost, but stopped needless. The virgin appeared as did <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
realizing his parking folly and at 630 pm had us run back into the park to the
first check, which took the trail back northeast than south and back east out
into the sea where the pack soon got their feet wet in the wet marsh and soon
unto the BC where <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> was waiting (no,I did not
miss anything, the run was that short as the hare was still reeling from the
spleen injury incurred whilst attempting to bugger our old and feeble GM).&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The pack gladly jumped into the sea and enjoyed
beer and enraptured the virgin with many a tune...the duration at the BC was
twice that spent in the entire run! Beer consumed, the pack headed out towards
the cars and met up with<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> who was God knows
where the entire run! The circle up was on the other side of 114 amongst poison
ivy and down downs to the hare, the virgin and the hashit (<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>)
for committing sins too terrible to mention. ON IN was at the head of the bike
path (whats a <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>run without the bike path?)
where the pack was met by <font color="#FF0000">Flushy, Mrs.WIPOS</font> and the
lovely hostess who persisted despite bad behaviour from yours truly! A good time
had by all...ONON. </font></p>
