<blockquote><p><i>“Nine hundred ninety-nine RIH3 hashes gone by, Nine hundred ninety-nine RIH3 hashes;<br>
One more I suffered, that I wish to forget, Nine hundred ninety-eight hashes gone by.”</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i><b>Scribe’s Note:</b>  This week bimbos and hounds together outnumbered the male wankers – Unbelievable!  It only 
took 999 runs for RIH3 to finally get its act almost together.  Unfortunately, it was more like a one in a thousand 
freak occurrence.  So for this serendipitous and joyous occasion, the scribe will exclude the names of the regular 
ball-bearing (get it? Ha, ha) hashers from the write-up – ala <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, 
and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>.  I for one say good riddance!  That much closer to a perfect hash.</i><br>
<br><br>

It was a warm sunny day, perfect for picnics and cook-outs; however, pathetic weather for a hash.  Being that it was a 
holiday, the hash started at two o’clock.  And on the eve of the RIH3 1,000th, nobody could guess who might come out of 
the woodwork.  <i>Who is this idiot I’m talking to?</i> Thought <font color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font>, visiting from 
West Virginia.  It was <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font>, of all possible hashers!  Didn’t he die like 10 years 
ago?  Incredible!  Coming out of his grave to hash again.  Then <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> arrived 
from CT.  <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> in the presence of two youthful bimbos.  He thought he was in 
hash heaven until the regular wankers gradually showed up.<br><br>

A Woonsocket wanker brought <font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Jake</font>.  Adding to the 
bimbo and hound count, <font color="#FF0000">Granola</font> arrived with <font color="#FF0000">Shits on Bunny</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Briar</font>, and sadly her boyfriend in tow.  And to complete this joint RIH3 - AKC hash, 
<font color="#FF0000">Seamus</font> finally arrived, yet disappointingly so did the hare.  At least the hare brought 
a pitcher of beer and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> to ease the tension in the air.  <i>[If only he could 
have ditched the shrink.  But I digress.]</i>  By the time everyone congregated, <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Sarah</font> could never have known she’d be in the presence of so many wankers with dogs (outside of a West 
Virginia coon hunt).<br><br>

The pathetic group stood around with uneasy and quiet anticipation, as though something spectacular (or disastrous) 
would soon transpire on the 999th RIH3 hash.  Or perhaps it was the hare, promising some virgin territory, in 
Burrilliville of all places!  Well, he was still blind and recovering from his eye operation, thus light or dark, it 
made no difference.  It all could be virgin from his perspective.  Nevertheless, they were off, heading northeast 
out of the middle school parking lot and into the woods.</p>

<center><p><br><img src="Images/999/TheEasyStuff.JPG" border="0" padding="10"><br><br><font color="#0000FF">The hare's 
vision on a good day</font></p></center>

<p><br>First check was quickly reached, and all hell broke loose.  The horror!  The co-hare dove straight into the woods, 
ignoring the obvious trail to the left or right.  Incorrectly assuming that the co-hare had some inside knowledge, 
most followed him into the woods, scampering around looking for any sign of a mark.  Even <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> were fooled.  
After 10 minutes of aimless wandering, <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> found true trail heading west along 
the shiggy-less trail.<br><br>

<font color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font> confessed that West Virginia hashes never run on trails.  What?  Which West 
Virginia was she from again?  Oh yeah, the up-scale yuppie urbanite West Virginia.  Already regretting this hideous 
mistake, she bravely (stupidly) continued on, and gave up the last chance to retreat and escape.  Trail soon reached 
Chepachet River, where the question was not “if” but “when” the trail will cross the river.  Most guessed wrong at the 
check searching along the banks of the river.<br><br>

At about this time, <font color="#FF0000">Just Michelle</font>, celebrating her graduation from RISD, joined the hash 
and was welcomed by an empty parking lot.  Somehow, she found trail, since the hare didn’t bother to leave an arrow for 
any late-cumers.  And like everyone else, she dove into the woods at the first check, rather than searching along the 
obvious trail.  RIH3 mentality seemed to be contagious, even the highly educated were helpless to instinctively wallow 
in shiggy.<br><br>

<center><p><br><img src="Images/999/RumbleintheBrambles.JPG" border="0" padding="10"><br><br><font color="#0000FF">Just 
Michelle discovering the love of RI shiggy.  But those feet look awefully dry!</font></p></center>

<p><br>The first river-bank check turned out to be a tease, as true trail went into briars and rhododendrons heading 
back southeast.  Trail haphazardly zigzagged back and forth, covering every square yard between the middle school and 
the Chepachet river, thus assuring that at least one foot of trail would be virgin.  <i>[But this also assured that 
there would be no virgin territory in the area ever again, being that Burrillville is the village whore of RIH3 
hashing.  But I digress]</i>.<br><br>

With every potential virgin spot covered, trail finally led back to the river.  Fervent with glorious anticipation 
for a river crossing, the regular ball-bearing wankers waded across the river with confidence that trail was there.  
The co-hare declared “On-on!” but all others knew better.  The hare helped bring all on true trail, saying that <font 
color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> was hot (an unnecessary, yet explicit confession).  On the other hand, <font 
color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> was hot, as she was standing 10 feet away from the mark hidden on the river 
bank.  Trail went downstream for a short while, and finally, finally, finally crossed the river.  The two fly 
fishermen nearby had the unfortunate experience of witnessing an RIH3 river crossing.  Knowing that there would now 
be no trout in the area, they grumbled as they packed up and left.<br><br>

<font color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font>, not knowing the errors of her ways, followed the FRB’s along true trail, 
crisscrossing the foot path and into a plethora of fine mud, muck, and mire.  Most of the others wussed out and 
short-cutted along the high and dry foot path.  Heading east, trail exited the woods and onto Reynold’s street for a 
little pavement pounding.  Southeast along Rt. 7 to the 7/102 intersection.  Trail crossed 102 marked by an arrow, but 
the hare called everyone back to the non-existent beer check under the 102 bridge.  Everyone gathered on the north 
side of the river bank, anticipating the beer, but there was no beer.  On the south side stood the other co-hare 
from Woonsocket, alone with the beer.<br><br>

Even with beer on the other side, nobody cared enough to be in the company of that particular wanker.  Then <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Michelle</font> finally caught up, next to the beer and that particular wanker.  Now with a bimbo 
at the beer check, the beer seemed more enticing.  <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> was first to brave the 
heavy and fast currents of the Chepachet to the beer.  A few others braved the rapids in pursuit of beer.  Amazingly 
and unfortunately, nobody lost footing to be washed away.  The hare took the high water and crossed at the dam.  The 
ones with brains took the bridge across to the beer check.</p>

detainee escapee now turned proctologist.</font></p></center>

<p><br>All savored Trinity IPA and song broke out.  A couple in a canoe arrived to a singing bunch of wankers.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Granola</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Shits on Bunny</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Briar</font>, 
feeling sorry for them, welcomed the couple, failing to convince them that hashers were not lunatics.  Finally, the 
couple mustered the courage to tow their canoe past the hashers to cross the dam.  Of course, nobody offered to help.  
Typical wanker behavior.  It was time to continue the run.  Again, those with brains, took the 102 bridge across 
to trail leading southeast along Rt. 7.  The others, as well as <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, successfully 
braved the rapids again and slowly caught up to the others.<br><br>

And what's Jake doing?  No wonder the grin on his face!</font></p>
</center>

<p><br>South along Douglas Pike, and then west onto Victory Highway, they were slowly completing the clockwise loop.  
<font color="#FF0000">Ben</font> did his best on Douglas Pike to get hit by a car, but there would be no such luck on 
this day.  Before continuing, they all had to visit the sand pits of Burrillville.  True trail headed up the hill and 
into the woods.  The pack quickly spread out, leaving nobody to help the now lost <font color="#FF0000">Pecker 
Checker</font>.  Crossing Victory Highway and onto 102, the trail concluded back at the Burrillville Middle School.  
<font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> was first to arrive, thus showing that hashing is much like riding a bike.  
Or perhaps after dozens of Burrillville hashes, he had the area committed to memory.  The horror!</p>

The Burrillville Sand Pit.  Ain't she lovely?</font></p></center>

<p><br>As the hashers petered into the parking lot, everyone eventually arrived except for <font color="#FF0000">Pecker 
Checker</font>.  One particular hasher grew uneasy, as he was sure he would earn hashit again by rescuing <font 
color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font>, or worse given a new name that accurately describing his pathetic sex life.  
Fortunately, she arrived, and all was well.  Minus <font color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font>, they departed for 
the hare’s house for the circle and On-on-on.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font> offered a lame excuse for her 
early exit, grumbling something about having to pick someone up at the airport, or something to that effect.  This 
time, nobody made any bets on her guaranteed return to RIH3.<br><br>

Circle was held, down-downs for the hares, visitors, and backsliders.  Comments on the run:  More bimbos than anyone 
can ever recall!  Virgin, sparse, but truly virgin territory!  The return of <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font>!  
Beer check on the wrong side of the river!  No “B” marking a beer check!  Shiggy galore!  All brilliant!  On the other 
hand, nobody lost, not even the hare.  A particular wanker from Woonsocket was present for part of the run.  Total:  
<b>+6.9!</b>  Hashit:  Who else, that particular wanker from Woonsocket who had to ditch a hash for his father’s 
funeral.  Then the hare produced a printed version of “R I H 3” for everyone to take turns singing verses.  It was 
fine communal singing until the last three verses, authored by the scribe, and then the song went to sh*t.  Religion, 
and onto the food and more drink!<br><br>

With good food and savory Trinity IPA on tap, all were happy.  <font color="#FF0000">Dog Meat</font> coordinated the 
food preparations and revived the bimbo count after the loss of <font color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font>.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Jodi</font> arrived skyrocketing the bimbo count to astronomical levels!  Every hash should be the 
999th hash!  Even <font color="#FF0000">Granola's</font> boyfriend was unusually well-behaved.  Hmmm... <font 
color="#FF0000">Granola</font> should hash with RIH3 more often.  It started to rain, but it was too late to be credited 
to the run.  <font color="#FF0000">Pecker Checker</font> was enshrined into RIH3, and renamed as <font color="#FF0000">
Sneezergasm</font>.  Oh the things they do to ensure no bimbos ever return (save <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font>)!  Slowly, some started to depart, and a particular assoooo threw all the hash cash into the pool.  And 
just to increase his assooo-ness, he plunked the bills with ice cubes causing all the bills to sink to the bottom.  At 
least it wasn’t a tv.  Then the assoooo departed to everyone’s relief.<br><br>

Speaking of talking assooo’s…  The best part of the day came when the village proctologist claimed he had “Lulu’s 
Talking Asshole” with him.  Only <font color="#FF0000">Dog Meat</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Jodi</font>, the hare, the village shrink, the scribe, and the village proctologist remained to 
enjoy this classic film.  Plenty of girl-on-girl, two cigarette scenes, a talking Oscar meets Lulu and then engulfed 
by Lulu, and foreign language erotica fast-forwarded for added effect.  Spectacular!  On the down side, Lulu 
desperately needed a haircut, and the male actors could have benefited from Viagra.  On a whole, the scribe still gave 
it a three thumbs up.  And that concluded the 999th complete waste of a day.</p>
