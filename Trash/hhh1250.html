      <font color="#0000ff">The Run:</font> <br/><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">After days of rain, rain, and more rain, it was sprinkling fitfully. This kept the womenfolk away, and guaranteed that the kilts, worn in honor of St Patty&rsquo;s Day would need a trip to the cleaners before the next parade. The parking lot chosen for the start was small, but somehow accommodated all the cars. Promptly at 6:30, they were off, crossing the Hunt River on the road and then heading southwest parallel to the river, on a bushwhack.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">

      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Trail led to Rt 4 and then became confused. The markings were sparse and waterlogged. Finally CEP and DOB figure it out, and the trail doubled back near the highway. Marks were found crossing Davisville Road and back into the woods. Calling this area &ldquo;woods&rdquo; is not exactly accurate. The river had overflowed its banks and &ldquo;pond-with-trees&rdquo; was a better fit. Just enough marks remained to convince the group that they were on the right track. But as the water deepened, the marks were gone.<p></p></span>

      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The hashers were mostly together, hoisting their kilts (which led to some sights better not seen, in general. Some high ground was seen, across the main part of the river. Flexi and CEP showed the way, the rest followed. Bondo of course, was missing at this point. Climbing out of the chest-deep water, they searched the hill, and soon found a path, and a mark. Trail was resumed, and soon came to the grinning hare and a &ldquo;W&rdquo; check atop an old gravel working, with a fine view of Rt 402.<p></p></span>

      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Some cheap bourbon was shared (a fine way to celebrate St Patrick&rsquo;s!). Maybe a song or two was sung through chattering teeth. But it was not long before they were on their way again. Trail was now on a dirt road. This led to a neighborhood, and they found marks leading them to Olde Mill Lane, and then out and south on Davisville Rd.<p></p></span>

      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">All the marks were gone by now, so the hare had to give directions. They turned west at Devil&rsquo;s Foot Road, and got off pavement again. A brief jog down to another Sand and Gravel Pit, and they came to some old sewer pipes, and the Beer Check. Most people walked through the five foot sewer pipes to the beer. Most people slipped when they walked through the five foot sewer pipes to the beer. It was real funny. Ha, ha. The beer was Bondo brew. They all looked forward to a good cleanout.<p></p></span>

    <p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNoSpacing">
      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: "Times New Roman","serif"; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The trail back was all road, as the hare hadn&rsquo;t been able to figure out how to meet up with the trails originating in the parking area and heading south. But everyone was getting pretty sick of this by now anyways. They circled up near the cars. Ratings were based upon fine river shiggy. Everything else about this run SUCKED! Total: -69! Hashit went to Basket. The On On On was at Oakhill. I&rsquo;ve said enough!</span>.</p>
