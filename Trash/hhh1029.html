<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">The WIPOS Incident</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1029</font>, December 19, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing SD</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Attleboro, MA.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 20’s, snowy and icy.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish It Head, Basket, Bondo, Cumunder Pubic Saw-her-squat, Dr. WHO, Dry 
Foot Fairy, Great at Giving Head, Just Bob, Trail Hoover, WIPOS, and Ben.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Well, if I hadn’t seen it for myself, I wouldn’t have believed it.  Yet, it actually happened, or so they say.  <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.  Completely submerged in icy cold water – rather, nearly completely submerged.  He managed 
to keep the only part of his body that was NOT covered in <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>-gear out of the water.  Most 
believed that it was <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> proving to the rest that his <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>-gear could withstand all but the harshest, Antartic, March-of-the-Penguins weather.  Only a 
few skeptics, like myself, believed that it was <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> accidentially falling into the water.  
Yet, I was not there to see it for myself.  Thus, truth and myth will forever be woven into the grey areas of our 
memories.  Beer might have had something to do with that too.</p>

<p>After the ad-hoc <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>-gear proof-of-concept trial, I managed to catch the pack, at the '
corner of Tiffany St & West St, heading westward toward Orrs Pond.  Catching them was not difficult, for <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was leading.  In fact, I didn’t catch them, rather they caught me!  What would you expect 
following <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>?  Nevertheless, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> forged ahead trying to 
follow the marks left by the hare.  <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> followed.  And <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Bob</font>, well, who knows what he was doing.  Actually, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> didn’t know.  Neither did 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.  But then again, what does Bondo really know? Yes, that was a rhetorical question.</p>

<p>Yadda, Yadda, Yadda....</p>

<p>The <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> incident made everyone sketchy about crossing the frozen-over fingers of Oors 
Pond, except for those who missed the <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> incident (moi).  Following the hare, I managed to 
get to the beer check first (last one to arrive, first to the beer check… Brilliant!), because I was the only one brave 
(S-T-U-P-I-D) enough to cross the ice-ed over pond.  After all, the arrows pointed the way.  Others weren’t so observant, 
except for <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, who joined us shortly.</p>

<p>So <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, and 
I watched others circumvent the pond, and being the fool-hearted ones we were, we crossed the pond when the others neared, 
and called them over.  They started around the pond again, and when they got close, we mosied across the ice to the other 
side again.  This happened about a half-dozen times before the wankers figured out what we were up to, and crossed the ice 
to the beer.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was still missing, so all were happy with overwhelming joy, song, beer, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font>.  So when <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> neared, the pack crossed the ice again to the 
other side.  This time, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> wouldn’t cross.  And for good reason!  His BMI (<font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>-brew Mass Index) would surely mean one step would put too much pressure on the ice and he 
would surely fall in.  <font color="#FF0000">Just Bob</font> wanted to show <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> that it 
wasn’t that bad, and he moved into the middle of the pond, with his beer, and sat down drinking by himself.  It was an 
impressive demonstration, but he forgot to pull his pants down prior to sitting on the ice, like a true hasher would.</p>

<p>After the beer check, the pack wandered back to the cars on Westbrook Lane and wandered to the opposite pond’s ice for 
the circle.  Comments included, “pathetic trail”,  “pathetic trail”, and “pathetic trail”.  On the positive side there was 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, isolated by the ice, keeping everyone else safe (which surely <font 
color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> appreciated), and, of course, the <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> incident.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Great at Giving Head</font> was impressed by this new wintery experience for him.  And <font 
color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> was underwhelmed by this old wintery experince for her.  Nevertheless, the 
mathematical total somehow equaled <b>+0.69</b>!  Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for setting such a 
pathetic trail.  Not even Basket could earn such honors.  On-on-on was at Weathervanes, and that’s all I’ve got to say 
about that.</p>
