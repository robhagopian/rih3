<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>As your new Religious Advisor, I’d like to thank all <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> voted for me. What an honor! I 
hope your faith in me will be justified, and I promise to come to every single hash for the next year, even if 
<font color="#FF0000">Great @ Giving Head</font> doesn’t drive. I plan to bring my close friend, <font color="#FF0000">
Just Ariana</font>, for some of these hashes. I hope to bring new religious life to the RIH3. I plan to stop <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> from getting naked, to cure <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi’s</font> addiction to wanking, and 
to keep <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> from singing. Finally, I’d like to inaugurate my term by doing the writeup for 
the AGM hash.</p>

<p>I’d never been to Woonsocket before. What a place! And what a trail! Or rather WHAT TRAIL?!! Apparently <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>, the hare, had laid marks only in the immediate vicinity of his own house, rather than 
risk getting lost (again?) in his own neighborhood. At first, I thought that this had been all planned out. But as we 
started I noticed <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> grabbing a paintcan-on–a-pole as we ran off. I wisely decided to 
stick with him, as he turned right out of the hare’s driveway. The other choice was to turn left and follow <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. Ha! <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> had no 
problem with this decision either. So <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went 
off, alone again. Later we heard that they had frolicked together for a while in Cold Spring Park along the banks of the 
Blackstone. No further details were offered or requested.</p>

<p>The rest of us then, were led by <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>. At first we followed the hare’s marks, but soon it became apparent that there was some 
re-marking going on, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> paintcan-on-a-pole contained flour. The trail led northwest on 
Woodland, turned right on Gaskill. A few checks led to some confusion, but we soon picked up the trail on Summer Street, 
which dead ended at a house next to some woods. Naturally, trail entered the woods. We crossed some brambles into another 
backyard, and found an abandoned road heading northeast. <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font> were trailing, and found an irate homeowner.</p>

<p>The new hare now opened up a bit of a lead as he laid a check, turned back west and came to an overgrown pond. His 
trail led through some muck to the north side of the pond, and bushwhacked up a ridge, turning back northeast. This was 
some good trail. Garbage, thorns and mud! We all were starting to be glad we came. But we soon were disappointed to find 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> sitting on a rough bench in the woods. A “B” was marked, but no “b” was present. We only 
rested briefly, to see if <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> were in custody. 
Both were satisfyingly missing, so we turned back on trail curving back southwest to Warner Street.</p>

<p>Trail led back into Woonsocket, by a circuitous route. The hare stopped at corners and made check marks. He then waited 
for the FRB’s to make a choice, so that he could mark the opposite as true trail. Now this is an innovation in 
live-haring! Finally we came back to the real hare’s house, mostly because <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was getting 
pretty thirsty, and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS’s</font> cab fare wasn’t enough to have an impromptu beer check at a bar. 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was surprised that we had been out so long. We were surprised and gratified that <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> were still missing. But of course they arrived, and 
began to try to boast of their adventure. Luckily, <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> briar gashes were enough to shut 
them up.</p>

<p>The circle and AGM were combined. This was strange, but no stranger than the decorations in <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo’s</font> garage. He had tables with chairs, newspaper tablecloths, and old AGM handouts, yearbook, buttons and 
songbooks scattered around. As the group settled in with some <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> “chili” (salt-free and 
highly inflammable), <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> took charge. He gave himself a series of meaningless awards. Then 
he gave out strange things: a rubber cactus to <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, and to <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>:  a flask with a small statue that dispensed scotch through an even smaller penis. Reminded me of <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> coming out of the water at Effin’s. None of the boys seemed to have much trouble with a 
quick suck. I passed, myself.</p>

<p>Finally, the election of officers was demanded. Of course, there could be only one choice for GM: <font color="#FF0000">
Seamus</font> was unanimously acclaimed. As his first official action, he refused the penis scotch, lay down and farted 
noisily. For webmeister, also a foregone conclusion, the absent Dry Foot. There was a brief move to elect <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> to ALL the other vacant positions. But after some clamor and ruckus, <font color="#FF0000">
Amish It Head</font> found himself Master of Ceremonies, and I found myself Religious Advisor. It certainly is an honor. I 
pledge to accomplish nothing whatsoever in the year to come, and hope to imbue all of you with sufficient religious 
education that you will BURN IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY! (Just kidding! Except for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>!)</p>
