<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica">The Hare Line told of a 'Surprise 
Hare', and excited faces were seen on all, as the pack slowly grew along the 
Banks of the Blackstone River. <font color="#FF0000">Shine On, Deep Throat</font>, 
and <font color="#FF0000">Cream Whora</font>, made the long journey down from 
Bean Town, while visions of Sugar Plum fairies laying flour was on the minds of 
Groton Hasher <font color="#FF0000">Smirf </font>and a virgin brought by
<font color="#FF0000">PW</font>. The Rhody H3'ers were all nestled in their 
woollies included <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>, the <font color="#FF0000">
Slasher Dr.WHO</font>, late arrivals <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom,</font> 
and myself, while the Mismanagement team of Jake, Ben, Baxter and Zoe sniffed 
each other to see who got the turkey last night. <br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> announced the 'Surprise' was that he was 
setting trail LIVE FROM WOONSOCKET! The sound of &quot;Khauffbullshit, Kahbullshit, 
Kahbullshit&quot; was resounding from all, as the hare ran westward along the 
riverbank and behind the mill buildings in this small mill village between Rhode 
Island and Massachusetts. We waited a reasonable amount of time, considering how 
long the hare would have given someone else, 10 minutes and we were off. We 
stayed together for safety until we reached the bridge crossing the river, where 
the pack split into 3 distinct groups. One over the bridge, one straight on to a 
field, and the third was rounding the roadway behind the buildings. It was here 
flour was found again, and the pack joined like a heard of lumbering Wildebeest 
or is that Lemmings, whatever, we made our way out to main crossroads and 
encountered another check. </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size="2">Hoping for an interesting trail, 
maybe off road, was cause for all to be disappointed. True trail went straight, 
then straight, and finally straight again, until we exhausted our straight 
options. Then traveling south back towards downtown, where a check brought the 
pack down an embankment to the tracks. Rail Road tracks tend to go straight, and 
the theme didn't change much until an arrow brought everyone up the bank and 
down again on an unmarked falsie. <br>
With total disregard and respect for his fellow hashers, the hare brought us 
back to roadway and into his neighborhood. A final check and arrow, indicating 
Beer Near, to the right was ignored by all except for <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> and visitors, as we knew the trail could only lead to
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> garage and beer. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size="2">Circling up inside, as beer was 
given the not yet warm bodies from the trail, who should appear, but
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Hoover</font> 
dressed like a Rain Deer. Beak showed up next and the circle was formed. </font>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica"><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was 
justly abused in return for what he did to us. Visitors, then virgins were 
likewise treated to their Down-down, and Hashit was passed from
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, to
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> once 
again. It is amazing how this bunch of malcontents can find so little to 
complain about. The circle finished with an invite from <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> for all to take his Brewery Tour, and those that have already 
viewed the largest brewery in Northwest Rhode Island took the leave upstairs for 
more beer and food. </font></p>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size="2">After enjoying a three-course 
dinner that did not include chili or Woonsocket Dynamites, Santa arrived to 
distribute the gifts. The expense that many endured in purchasing these fine 
examples of hash material, was enough to choke a horse. &quot;Where's the recession? 
Don't they know money is tight? Hasn't 9/11 taught anyone to be sensible?&quot;
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="arial,helvetica"><font color="#FF0000">PW</font> was 
first to get his gift and promptly complained that he hadn't brought anything, 
and his gift was more than expensive. &nbsp;One by one all received their gift and 
each in turn was seen a small tear in the corner of each eye. &nbsp;Pool playing and 
darts rounded out the festivities, until each Who in Whoville made their way to 
their sleighs and home to snuggle in front of warm fires and wonder at the grand 
event today brought. <br>
