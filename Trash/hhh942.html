<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare: </font><font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi Boner</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Blackstone Bikeway, Lincoln</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Low 50’s, Raining</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>  <font color="#FF0000">The Slasher Dr WHO, Tinker, WIPOS, Basket Boom Boom, 
Seamus</font>.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>There was limited attendance again for the RIH3, despite ideal weather and near-virgin territory. And the rain had 
been hard enough to guarantee that the hare would have to reset (as indeed he did), leaving to lay more flour at 6:15. He 
left <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> with a chili beer, and putting this fiery brew down with Tinker and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>gave the hare more than enough head start.</p>

<p>Trail led from the bikeway parking lot on the bikeway northwest. It immediately diverged and crossed down to the banks 
of the Blackstone. A falsie along the canal towpath led <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font> to a dead end. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> chose to go up the hill along the river, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> followed. There were three parallel trails at varying height on the sides of the ridge, and 
it was apparent that it didn’t much matter which one you were on (except that the lowest was flooded in places, and was 
avoided). <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and Seamus led, and were first to cross under the Rt 295 bridge, followed at 
differing levels by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, then <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS</font>. Some had waterfalls to ease their way. Some did not.</p>

<p>Trail now meandered west, uphill, then down, following 295. There were many choices, but the true trail was actually 
well marked.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led, following flour without difficulty. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>chose this moment as usual, to strike out on his own. He keeps doing this. It must have worked for him once. 
But not in your scribe’s experience. As usual, he became lost.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> followed the marks carefully, and eventually came through a swampy area, crossing a 
downed fence to the first BC, at the abandoned rest stop on the southbound side of 295. He found the hare and a growler of 
IPA.<font color="#FF0000"> Tinker </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> showed up. While drinking and waiting for 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> the wind shifted and the unmistakable odor of decomposing flesh wafted from one of 
the abandoned buildings. While adding to the flavor of the evening, it did not improve the flavor of the beer. It was felt 
that this probably came from an animal trapped in the building, but it was not worth investigating more closely. But when 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> finally appeared, he made the rounds looking for the source. Apparently, he is not 
only blind, but has an impaired sense of smell. Luckily, nothing was found. [This is an interesting problem in hash 
responsibilities. What if there had been a body? Does one ignore the whole thing? Does one phone in an incidentally 
discovered corpse anonymously? Or does one try to explain to a youthful police officer what exactly four older men, one 
younger man, and a large, shaven St. Bernard were doing, trespassing in an abandoned rest stop, in the rain, drinking 
beer on a Monday night?]</p>

<p>At any rate, the trail continued, west and north onto a residential street, Timberland Drive to Kirkbrae, and then up 
and out to Old River Road, where it turned southeast and crossed back over 295. The Lincoln High School fields were 
reached, and trail led to the cross-country trails headed east. Numerous balls were found, of all types. <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> began collecting, and managed to accumulate a golf ball, a tennis ball, a softball, a 
baseball, and a field hockey ball. If not more! Trail led through the leaf and grass dump for the schools, through some 
skunk cabbage and finally to a slightly swampy area. The hare was found waiting, now out of flour.  He led from this point. 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>became fascinated by a rock, and fell behind.</p>

<p>The second beer check was a mirror image of the first. This was the northbound abandoned rest stop. There was again a 
growler of IPA. There was again an odor of decomposing flesh.<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> was again missing. At 
least this time, they had some balls!  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> finally puffed and huffed in, mud covered and 
unrepentant. He produced some absurd story about finding the perfect rock for his fountain in Glendale. He rolled it up 
the hill with all sorts of difficulty and left it by the highway. Right! Having had enough beer and enough decomposing 
flesh for one evening, the BC was cut short. They headed back out, skirting a swampy area and rejoining the bikeway near 
its turn-around point.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the cars, they stopped to circle up. Ratings for the run were outstanding: rain, dead bodies 
everywhere, two beer checks, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, lots of balls, etc. etc.  Total: 6.9! Hashit: is there 
any question? Then, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> gave away his balls, and they had religion. They came to the cars 
and regrouped at Tuck’s. Another fine evening for the RIH3. Could there BE any better enticement for a prospective hasher 
than this tale? Your scribe is sure that once this write-up makes the internet, we will be inundated with virgins. To make
