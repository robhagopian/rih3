<p><i><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></i></p>
<p>It was a dark and stormy night, the tell tale heart thumped a rhythm in all of the lemmings ears, as we waited the 
distant figure, making his way along a bleak and lonely Division Road all alone. As he came closer the outline of a 
desperate man, at the end of his rope, looking for some small kindness from his friends. It was <font 
color="#FF0000">Async,</font> having been lost in the deepest swamp of the Big River Sewage Slurry. All we could say to 
comfort him was, &quot;Where's the fuckin' beer?&quot; It was 28 past the hour, and it became quite evident, that no 
others would join us.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing, the Slasher, Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Baxter </font>were explaining to 
the Groping Groton Guys, that the hare knows this area like the back of his hand. Too bad he was always looking at the 
penis in his palm, instead of the back of his hand. He was quite disheveled and forlorn, and the sorry bastard looked 
like he had just arrived from Kabul.</p>

<p>Miserable instructions were given, and the pack migrated out towards the highway, over the very same dunes that were 
the final resting place for the &quot;Lone Jogger&quot; 5 years ago this week.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
had his Hash instincts in high gear as he proceeded to get lost off to the north, while the main pack crossed 2 dunes and 
followed a path to the south.</p>

<p>It was a path covered with pines, bending low to shelter us from the last breath of winter. A storm had brought much 
needed rain just the day before, but little was left, save that damned cold blast from Canada, chilling and killing our 
desire to be outside, with thoughts of a roaring fire, two fists of beer, while the naked waitress asks if there's 
anything she can give us?????</p>

<p>So much for the pleasantries. I found myself lagging far behind those of smaller waists and derrieres, and soon 
feeling the hot breath of Baxter on the back of my neck, made my hair stand on end. He's a devil of a dog. A full foot 
taller than I am when crawling up a sandy crag. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> followed a short way behind, and the 
three of us proceeded to shortcut to the road. We knew the trails would converge there, and it only made sense to save 
our energy for later.</p>

<p>The pack was just crossing as we arrived, and together the sorry band of malcontents made their way out to a putrid 
swamp.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> had not been seen in some time, so we wondered if there was a trick up 
the weasel's arse. We continued along a deer path, our across some standing water, leaping wherever possible from clump 
of grass to fallen tree. More often we fell short and up to our knees in the foulest stagnant water and of a stench most 
difficult to explain as my throat, even still tightens against the veins of my neck.</p>

<p>A Beer Check was found eventually, and it was sometime later that the bag of goodies was found. As all drank from the 
lovely liquid, <font color="#FF0000">Async's</font> voice, like the sound of so many tree frogs, came whispering across 
the water. He was paddling his canoe, and was quite quick to explain how he had set trail far off in the distance, and 
had planned to bring us across to the beer. His failing was he had gotten lost, and couldn't find his way back to the 
same location. After the start he had ran ahead of us and remarked the trail cutting off 5 miles of gut wrenching 
smell.</p>

<p>As we enjoyed the beer, other voices and a whistle was hear. Soon splashing and vicious complaints of the location of 
a beer stop brought a duo from Newport. I guess the weather wasn't better further east, and they decided to grace our 
hash.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Seaman Mixer </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Miranda Rights</font> had made it just as the last 
beer was opened. The more generous of us shared theirs, while the bulk hung tightly to their glass vessels. Having 
finished the beer, we started out across the same deer trail, turning northerly now and into deep standing pools on the 
back roads. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> tried to find the most shallow out along the edge, but instead found a 
steep slippery slope, and water splashing his most precious jewels, 'the balls of Mohammed&quot;. &nbsp;We were soon at 
Beer Stop number 2 and the circling up.</p>

<p>The hare got a Down-down, along with the visitors. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> got one for a fairly lame 
excuse, and many songs were sung until the beer was finished. We sojourned to the same old bar <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> always takes us to, and we had much joy and satisfaction, knowing we were safe and warm with 
beer near.</p>
