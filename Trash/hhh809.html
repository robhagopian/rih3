<font SIZE="2" face="Arial">
<p>The d'erections instructed the pack to pass the gate with the lion statues.&nbsp; 
LIONS?? The only angle the two bulls would resemble lions if it was pitch dark 
and you were engaged in K9/69 fellatio with Jake. Ah well, even the GM falls 
down to earth every now and then!&nbsp; Locating the start was as it appeared 
the most challenging part of the run.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The pack sans <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was sent into the park with 
promise of plenty of flour. It was well in the low 30s and dropping as the pack 
braved the wind and went looking for flour. On deeper into the park amazingly 
this bunch of half wits negotiated the sparsely marked trail. Soon we were 
joined by late cummer extraordinaire <font color="#FF0000">BasketBB</font>.
<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">DrWHO</font> led 
the pack towards the shore and back into the park and eventually to the BC. Here 
the pack was entertained by hash songs from a CD player!!&nbsp; Surely she 
didn't dislike our collective voices?&nbsp; No more likely the hare was showing 
off her new Cd player!&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> soon joined the 
pack and beer was consumed and the pack made it back to the start. </p>
<p>The circle commenced and by now freezing rain was upon us.&nbsp; Down downs 
to the hare, the hashit <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> (for latecumming and 
missing the hash the week before to go to Henfield hash) and
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> donned his <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
lookalike mask(eery!). The ONIN was at TINKERS bar...no not that
<font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>... otherwise we would have had great Thai 
food instead of shitty burgers! A minstrel played his merry tune and the hash 
gleefully joined in!&nbsp; All in all, a good time had by all...ONON.</p>
