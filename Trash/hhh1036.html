<p><font color="#008000">Run #1036</font>, February 6, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Cumberland, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 30's</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amazon.cum, Basket, Bondo, Dry Foot Fairy, Fuwangi, Oozing, WIPOS, Seamus 
and Ben.  Late:  Cum Under PSHS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The run started at the North Cumberland Middle School off Nate Whipple Highway.  The last time <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> visited here, it was 1996, and he was expelled for bringing alcohol on school property.  
And to celebrate his return, the hash brought alcohol on school property.  Brilliant!  Of course. the hare tried, 
unsuccessfully, to bring <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> back to his old school the previous year -- See Hash <a 
href="hhh983.html">983</a>.</p>

<p>For moral support, <font color="#FF0000">Amazon.cum</font> came along – under-dressed for the occasion, but nobody 
complained.  Wee nips were shared by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.  And with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> present, 
the pejorative 6:30 rolled around, and the pack was off, heading east along Nate Whipple Highway for a few hundred yards 
before an arrow was encountered pointing left (north).</p>

<p>The hare, for his part, made the most of the limited shiggy present.  As usual, there was some fore-play with the 
stream before all were made to get wet.  Unfortunately, this was not a good wet.  It was a cold, numbing wet.  Well, the 
hare seemed to gain some pleasure out of it.  Regardless, the pack continued north for a while, some additional checks 
were reached, then trail bent westward.  Most followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and the hare on true trail, but 
<font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> followed <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> on a short-cutting attempt.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> followed for a bit, skeptical and all.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill, the pack soon came together again after an obscure check.  Finally, finally, finally, someone 
followed the trail to the true top of the hill where the beer was stashed.  All were happy with IPA, Guinness, hot nuts, 
cold feet, and song.  The mood was blissful until <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> arrived with Ben.  Too bad <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> called <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to the BC.  That wanker!</p>

<p>After some time passed, all began to freeze.  <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> was becoming hypothermic, and even 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> felt a chill (unbelievable!).  So the pack resumed trail southward back to the school.  
Circle was held, and comments on the run seemed to focused on the disappointment that trail did not cross into a local 
apple orchard with an angry shotgun toting landowner.  By this time, <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> was turning blue, 
but managed to squeak out a positive rating of <b>6.9</b>, which managed to be the mathematical total!  Hash it went to 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, so what’s new?  That was a rhetorical question.</p>

<p>The wankers moseyed over to Tuck’s for some semi-hot soup, drink, and hot sandwiches.  To their surprise, they were 
booted from the main dining room as two separate parties were monopolizing the seating:  A group of geriatrics (about 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> age), and a group of middle-aged married women re-united as they graduated high 
school together.  Hmmm…. decisions, decisions.  Leave it to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to start the singing and 
gain the attention of the old ladies.  Leave it to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to seat himself at the table of 
desperate housewives (who seemed to get cuter by the beer!).  Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Amazon</font> felt left out 
as she was stuck with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.</p>

<p>Oh the singing!  Oh the singing!  Even <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> joined in the fray!  This would have to have 
been one of the best on-on-on’s in hash history, but the hare still can’t take credit for it.  Nevertheless, at about this 
time, <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under PSHS</font> was still late to the hash, alone, cold, and still trying to find away 
across the stream without getting wet.  But why!?!?</p>

<p>And with that, another pathetic Monday evening concluded.</p>
