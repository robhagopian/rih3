<p><font color="#008000">Run #1088</font>, February 5, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Lincoln, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 10s, clear, windy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Amish Ithead, Basket, Dr. WHO, Seamus, Eenie Weenie Dick, Justin My Ass, 
Dry Foot Fairy, Fuwangi Boner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>I’m not a doctor, but I play one on TV.  Or at work.  Or wherever I can convince women to let me look at their lady 
parts and quickly run away before the cops show up.  One thing about being a (fake) doctor is that you get a good idea of 
what a person’s made of.  What they’ve got going on inside their head and what they may have going on downstairs.  In the 
case of the RIH3, there ain’t much in the groinal area (this is the technical term, “crotch” to the layman), and on this 
night there was even was even less as the winds whipped along to the tune of a -10 to -15F wind chill.  Not even some IPA 
could get those things to unshrivel!</p>

<p>The hash started with a little excitement, more than we’d see on trail, and definitely more than we’d see for days 
until “things” thawed out.  The Man.  The Fuzz.  Johnny Law.  Apparently a group of people standing together in a 
restaurant parking lot appears suspicious, and a few patrons of the Lodge called for the cops to come check us out.  Makes 
sense though, the RIH3 is a rough and tumble gang of thugs (hahahaha), but after the first, second and a little later, 
third, cop realized we were no harm we were left back to our own pathetic existences.</p>

<p>As 6:30 rolled around (quite slowly too, that cold air made the clocks move at half their normal pace) the on-in was 
located behind the Lodge, leading northwest.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> jumped out front while the rest huddled 
together in a pack in attempt to stay warm.  Trail continued towards the north, then east, then southeast and then south 
back to……………the Lodge parking lot.  Brilliant!  We’d gone nowhere by going somewhere.  By this time <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> had arrived and graced us with his presence by coming in the out way.  Hey, I’m not one to judge - whatever 
floats his boat.</p>

<p>The hare told us true trail was across the street in Lincoln Woods, so we all ran in that direction, past the cops, and 
up the hill into the darkness.  Once again the cold wind ripped through us, almost bringing some to a halt.  A path was 
found leading towards the southwest and not too soon after a check was found.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> went left 
and downhill along the smooth, snow-covered rocks.  <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> went right and farther uphill.  
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> went, well – the only other way, straight.  After two marks he turned around most 
likely due to the cold air freezing his eyeballs blind.  After a quick jaunt downhill to find <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> it was determined that this was not the correct way to go, so uphill they went and <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> found trail leading straight past where <font color="#FF0000">Amish
</font> had stopped.</p>

<p>I can’t remember where <font color="#FF0000">Justin</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> were, I can only assume there was some butt-to-nut huddling action going on to keep warm.  
I can’t lie; I’d like to have been asked to join in.</p>

<p>After a bit another check was encountered and with <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> continuing to the left and downhill 
to a fence.  A lovely, wire fence.  Our hare is quite familiar with those, and would once again have a close encounter 
before the night was over.  Down the fence a “B” was found, a quick hop over and climb up the biggest rock in the field 
had us at the beer check.  The cold, cold, windy beer check.  Apparently we were on private property and in the middle of 
a livestock pasture, but that didn’t stop us from chugging beer down, shivering, and trying to get the damn thing over 
with as soon as possible.  Although, with no <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> we did have the slight desire to stick 
around and enjoy the peacefulness.  As we sat there, lights out, we could see him coming down the path and attempted to 
hide our location by sitting silently.  This was not to help, as <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> has enough reflective 
tape on his jacket/pants to bring a 747 in on final approach and with a quick sweep of his light <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> easily picked us up.  A few songs were sung, but mainly everyone wanted out.</p>

<p>Hopping the fence again had us turn to the left, back up to a set of power lines and back to Breakneck Hill Rd and the 
Lodge.  Beer check was held in the woods, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> announced his daughter had been married that 
day, and we bashed the hare for such a crappy trail.  But a short trail, and most appreciative in the weather conditions 
we had.  Boos included the lack of frozen lake shiggy, cheesy circle jerk at the beginning, and the fact that <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> found the beer check.  Cheers were – well, it was short?  Mathematical total: <b>-6.9!</b>  
The hashit was awarded to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> for being himself as we all wanted to get warmed up in the 
Lodge.  The waitresses apologized the cops, remembered <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> we were, but not that we ran on 
Mondays.  Sure.  Their attempt to get us hauled off was foiled.</p>

<p>The usual food throwing, black and tan mixing and immaturity was to follow.  Immaturity that usually occurs 
pre-puberty, but with their members shrunken and frozen this almost made sense……</p>
