this was familiar territory to most of the hashers. Too bad it was not familiar 
to the hare. <FONT color=#ff0000>Retard </FONT>had grown shamed from sponging 
free beers from the hash, and had agreed to set a trail. Next time, just conquer 
your shame, and keep sponging.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

trail. And west they went. There were no checks. Just west. They crossed a 
stream. Heading west. Finally, one of the three checks found that night sent 
them curving to the northwest. <SPAN

<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>, of course, went on his own way, and got lost.

color=#000000>Led by <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>CEP</FONT>, the hash found the second check, and doubled back a 
bit, south and then east. Only to be directed north, crossing the stream again. 
What a hash! The compass boxed in less than 20 minutes! The third check had the 
pack confused for a while. True trail led out to Beach St. But there was a mark 
(in snow) that looked to <FONT color=#ff0000>Amish</FONT> like an “X”, and 
initially the trail was assumed to be false. Finally, it was solved, and the 
hash was well-spread out, running East on Beach and then south on Taunton where 
the hare was encountered, giving encouraging 
remarks.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>An arrow marked the re-entry point into the woods. A confusing 
mark, “BD”, was seen. This was never explained. They finally ignored it and 
proceeded without much ado to the Beer Check, next to the stream. All straggled 
in eventually, with <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Pubic </FONT>coming in quite late, quite out of breath and asking 
<FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> for a smoke. The usual songs were butchered, and 
when the beer was gone a simple south to east dog-leg had them back at the cars. 
Circling up, the hare asked that the “Beermeister” bring out the beer for the 
circle. Blank stares. Not funny. But, by the same token, he was not joking. 
Rhode Island hashing custom had to be explained. And he is not named <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Retard </FONT>for nothing. It was decided to head south on Rt. 1 
where Basket remembered a liquor store. <o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Shemale Man</FONT>) arrived 
at the liquor store, and the hare came out with a few 12 packs. Oh, and he was 
almost arrested. But I digress.&nbsp;The circle was formed is an old 
mulch-and-discarded-tire pile behind the store. It was pretty much in plain 
view, despite their best efforts. The run was rated. Excluding the biting and 
fractious comments regarding the site of the circle, the best anyone could say 
revolved around the presence of two bimbos, the absence of <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> at the&nbsp;BC and circle, and the acceptable 
ice-shiggy. Pavement, few falsies and<FONT color=#ff0000> Basket</FONT> sealed 
his fate. Total: +0. Hashit went to<FONT color=#ff0000> Basket</FONT>, for being 
acquainted with the hare for the longest time. And they finished up, and tried 
their luck at Champions.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
