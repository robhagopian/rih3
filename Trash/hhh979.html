<p>It has been over two years since the hash has blessed Lincoln Woods with its presence, so the hare decided that 
with the memory difficulties plaguing most of the hash regulars, he could get away with recycling this location as 
virgin territory. And apart from <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> (probably having more cosmetic surgery), all 
the regulars were suckers enough to show up. Promptly at 6:30, they started, on the trail behind the Lodge in 
Lincoln.</p>

<p>True trail led east briefly. Most were smart enough to figure that the road must be crossed, so when a check 
appeared, they simply turned south and entered Lincoln woods. Trail led southeast on familiar paths, made only 
slightly more interesting by the presence of 3-4” of crusty snow.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led initially, 
as they began a circle around Tablerock Hill. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>picked correctly (for once) 
and started the climb west up the hill. Soon, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> found themselves on the wrong side of a small river, while <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> led the <font color="#FF0000">Fairy</font> on trail to a 
check on one of the paved roads on the crest of the hill. This one stymied them, though.  The entire pack caught up 
here. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tried left, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>tried right. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> went straight. They all came back. The hare was so proud.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> arrived, having walked trail backwards towards the confused noises. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> decided to have a sit down strike, until the hare caved in and showed them the 
way, to the right, downhill and northwest. They soon were climbing again, this time on Quinsnicket Hill. They circled 
the top and came upon the BC. What a marathon! It must have been at least 7:05 pm! They spread out to find the 
beer. Again, they needed help from the hare. But soon the beer was out and opened, and all (except <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, who was headed back to the cars and the Lodge) were happy. Some singing and a snowball 
fight marked the check, with most trying to dislodge <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> from his perch on a boulder 
for lack of anything else to do. Pathetic!</p>

<p>Trail back was uneventful: a short northeast-then-north bushwhack to 123, then back across the street to the 
Lodge. Two miles total, at most. But most were done in anyways. There were hills, after all. And all that snow. 
They circled in the woods behind the restaurant. Ratings for the run: flagrant recycling, clear weather, 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and<font color="#FF0000"> Bondo</font> at the BC, short trail, and no Just 
Ariana were balanced by… what? There were NO GOOD ASPECTS to this run! That alone converted this to a +69! Hashit 
was given to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, because he wanted it so-o bad. He had stayed up all night learning 
a new song, which he wanted to sing so-o bad. And he did. It was so-o bad! The circle was completed and they moved 
into the Lodge.</p>

<p>The Lodge has cleaned up considerably in the last few years and is getting pretty Chardonnay-and-Brie for the 
RIH3. Nevertheless, once the food came out, the hash was successful in pretty much clearing out the main dining room 
with some fine singing. Particularly effective was a long version of The Sexual Life of the Camel (“We’re all 
Queer together…”) sung to a pair of well-dressed older men eating together at a candlelit table in the corner. The 
stakes for last weeks bet regarding the return of <font color="#FF0000">Just Ariana</font> were reviewed. [They cannot 
be enumerated here, in case she for some reason reads this and is unduly influenced to return. We are counting on 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>paying for the On On On’s for the rest 
of the year. Oops!] Another hash behind us, and no closer to learning the errors of our ways.</p>
