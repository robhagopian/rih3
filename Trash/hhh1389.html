Date:  Nov 12, 2012<br><br>
Start: Soccer Field off Wyatt Rd, Middletown, RI<br><br>
Hare: Rusty<br><br>
Weather: Not too hot or too cold as I remember<br><br>
The Pack:  OOzing, Hairy Krishner, WHO, Pussy Galore, Fuwangii, Crotch Tiger, Basket, Ass Quack, Crabby, FloBanger, Shemale, Cisco Kid, among others lost to memory.<br><br>

It's a long way from Woonsocket and I arrived just as the pack was leaving the lot. It took me a bit to get our of my civvies and into my gear and it was long enough that I had to rediscover the direction of the pack. There was no noise to point me in a direction, so I wondered through a graveyard and into turned over farmer's field before finding one solitary mark of flour. <br><br>

That was all I needed as I soon heard the calls from the RIH3 searching at a check. I joined the fray and we all rejoined our efforts as Hairy and WHO located the trail. I was just behind Crotchy and soon discovered she's quite an athlete and being behind her has many positives. She's adept at finding flour and extremely flexible as she bends down under low branches  and crawls on her hands and knees through the thickets. I was in awe of her great form, and had no reason nor opportunity to pass her...why would I?<br><br>

The trail led us through a nature walk and out towards the bay, where beer was found at a beautiful overlook. There was much singing and rejoycing as we enjoyed IPA and orange food. A light breeze from the water quickly made the sweat I had acquired running behind Crotch Tiger turn to a chill. We all pressed ourselves together to save heat and enjoyed the beverage and company in the dark waning moonlight.<br><br>

It wasn't long before we finished the beer and started back out to finish the trail. Back at the cars, a cooler of beers was brought out by the Hare and the circle ensued. DD's were given to all those deserving, including the Hare, Backsliders, a visitor and finally the Hashit to AssQuack for some sin against nature.<br><br>

With the circle complete, and rated as a negative 6.9, some went home and others including: Crabby, Ass Q, Basket, Rusty, Crisco, Fuwangii, Hairy and LB, and others found the beer and food at PJ's just fine before making our way home.<br><br>
