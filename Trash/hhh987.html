<p><font color="#008000">Run #987</font>, March 7, 2005.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Beyond Hope</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:&nbsp;</font> Breakheart Pond, Exeter (Arcadia).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Low 40’s, melting snow.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Dry Foot Fairy, Dr WHO, Async, Oozing SD, Basket Boom Boom, Bondo Jovi, 
Ben, Seamus.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The return of the <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> one as hare was not viewed with much optimism by the 
usual crowd. Family life has a way of softening the brain, and his mental faculties were already suspect before he 
began to have children. But the hareline is sparse enough. So everyone decided upon tact. The starting point was 
choice: the boat ramp next to Breakheart Pond in Arcadia, at the end of a half-mile stretch of unplowed snow and 
slush on a dirt road. For a while it looked as if some of the cars might not make it. But God loves idiots, so 
eventually, the group was safely parked, and headed off on trail.</p>

<p>Trail initially led north along the shore of Breakheart Pond in an unpleasant mixture of snow covered slush. 
Footprints and marks were plentiful, and they were all together as they turned left and west on the yellow-blazed 
Breakheart Trail. There were a few checks, but virtually all of them continued straight. It was still enough to 
confuse <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. The trail was all uphill, defying the laws of geography. The main 
group crossed Acid Factory Brook on a bridge. They briefly left the yellow trail, but soon came back, crossing 
Phillips Brook, again on a bridge.  <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> was way ahead at this point, and it 
looked as if he might have all the beer for himself. But he met <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> at a check mark 
and the two of them managed to become confused enough that the rest joined and passed them.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> took the lead as trail turned south on the white-blazed Shelter Trail. This 
led to an abandoned group of cabins. This was a natural beer stop, so <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> joined by 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> began searching, hoping to find the stash before <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>could arrive.  <font color="#FF0000">The Fairy</font>, again showing a keen instinct 
for finding beer, came across the sign in a cabin with roof but little in the way of walls. A fine selection of 
canned Guinness and Beamish stouts was enjoyed. The rhubarb refused to rise, even with no bimbos or newcomers.</p>

<p>Beer finished, they continued on trail, south along the Flat River. One check was encountered, and given away by 
the hare, and they made their way back to Austin Farm Rd and the Hare’s Truck. A full load, with tailgate open, and 
they careened back through the slush to the parking lot. The circle was held. Ratings: straight with no checks, no 
one lost, too long, no bimbos vs slush/snow, good beer, return of a lost hare (even if he is a wank.)  Total: 0.69. 
Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> no, <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font></p>

<p>Regrettably, all made it up the slushy hill. They were heading for “a new discovery” by the hare, a little bar 
called “Marks” in Coventry (exit 6 not 6A). He really hasn’t run much with the RIH3 in some time, has he? With the 
new laws, Marks was for the first time smoke-free, and were glad to see the group. There were even patrons louder 
than the hash table. A few songs were tried, but no one noticed. Once again, pathetic!</p>
