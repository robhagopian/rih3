night. And visitors, too. What is the RIH3 coming to? Pretty soon, we’ll be

Starting from a Middle School in Norton, MA, the hash was eagerly prompt in 
setting off on trail, heading north east behind the school, leaving some anxious 
looking parents behind in the parking lot.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

to W. Main Street. A short pavement segment and they found trail turning back 
into the woods, now northwest. They headed briefly on a dirt road, and a check 
sent them east for a meaningless loop. Back on track, they continued northwest, 
well away from the Wading River. A few checks tantalized, but gave no 
satisfaction.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

the thin ice of the pond. It turned out to be just a long falsie. The pack 
turned around. There was great confusion. Finally, true trail was found, heading 
north and then east to the beer check. Less than 30 minutes had 
passed.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

Trail led southwest, crossing the Wading River. They hit a check with a falsie 
that would have led to the most direct route back on the road, but no one was 
smart enough to realize this. So they followed marks southeast on the other side 
of the river pretty much straight back to the school. They circled 
up.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

completed in one hour. Looked good for the hare briefly. However, <FONT

in a frozen pond, and minimal shiggy. Total: +0. The visitors were punished, and 
duly sang. The virgins were interrogated, and I believe, told a joke. Hashit 
went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT>. I’m not about to start remembering 
why, at this point in my life. And <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> is

Wetherlaines. But <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> can
