<p><font color="#008000">Run #994</font>, April 25, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Midway Trail, Arcadia, Exeter.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 40’s, clear.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Async, WIPOS, Oozing SD, SESYB, Bondo Jovi, Basket Boom 
Boom, Tinker, Dry Foot Fairy; Visitor/Two-timer: Pud Pirate (BH3); Seamus, Ben.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Everyone parked at Camp E Hun Te (that is the “White Church”) at first, because of typically bad d’erections. There 
were at least three different versions to choose from between the Hareline and the new guestbook. But at about 6:15, 
the hare ran up Rt 165 to the motley group. He directed them to park 200 yds down the road at the entrance to the 
Midway trail.  At the trailhead, all was quiet. <font color="#FF0000">Peckerchecker</font> had been expected. No show. 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, always early, was missing. Still no sign of <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Areola</font>. Many Virgins, promised by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> yet again, were not present. But the hash 
must go on.  And off they went at 6:30.</p>

<p>Trail led north on the dirt entry road to a check. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turned left.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> turned right, both on the Hargraves Tr. Both wrong, as usual. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> found true trail straight (on the Brook Trail). The next check 
was encountered just across the Flat River bridge.  Marks led south on far bank, and were faithfully followed by <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. Later 
arrivals <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> stayed on the near bank, suspecting 
chicanery. They paralleled the others. After a while with no marks, they decided to call “On On” to draw the leaders 
back across the river. At least there would be some amusement potential here. But only <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> could be fooled. No surprise!  <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> 
pressed on, heading northwest God-knows-where off trail, and bringing the visitor <font color="#FF0000">Pud 
Pirate</font>, naïve to their ways, with them.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> continued up the Brook Trail following secret directions from hare. <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> were too busy 
crossing the stream back and forth to be fooled by <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> plaintive calls from deeper 
and deeper in the woods. But they did attract <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> to their group.  Apparently, however, 
the trail was a circle jerk.  <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> returned to the Brook Trail with <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> ahead, and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> closing fast. Sounds exciting? Not a chance.</p>

<p>Trail continued northwest to a check at the intersection of the Brook and Barber trails. On straight, it then led to 
the junction of the Brook and Midway Trails. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> led the hare northwest on trails to some farmland. 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> were lost by this point, and headed off towards 
Breakheart Pond for a romantic interlude. The rest curved southwest, crossing Brook Trail to a bushwhack, southward. 
They came to the Falls River; options for crossing were explored. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> took the direct 
route, in the water, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and hare found a fallen tree 
to cross, while <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> tried a different log, resulting in a most satisfactory fall into 
the water halfway across.</p>

<p>Now trail led up the North South Trail to a check at Barber Farm. There were five alternatives. And four hashers. Confusion ensued. Unfortunately, this allowed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Pud 
Pirate</font> to rejoin the pack.  Finally, true trail was found by <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, turning southwest 
onto Mt Tom proper.  They soon caught up to <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>. Trail curved south then southeast to the 
summit of this mighty peak, and then turned down the slope partway to the first Beer Check.</p>

<p>Growlers of Scotch Ale and Porter were served. The absence of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> was unfortunately offset by the presence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. To make 
matters worse, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font> arrived. Arriving late, the trail had proved no challenge to 
him. [Given the combined 75 years of experience held by the well-lost <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, compared to the 7 month experience of <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, this should 
give some warning to those anticipating a long career in hashing and its effect on the intellect. Maybe it’s just the 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew. But I digress.] Nevertheless, the beer was cold, and the first mosquitoes of 
the year were appearing. A few songs were sung. But the stop was not prolonged as the beer supplies were running low, 
and the threat of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> stumbling onto true trail was preying on all minds. They set out 
on trail southeast..</p>

<p>As they approached Rt 165 on the Mt Tom Trail, marks led to a bushwhack paralleling the road east. The leaders 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Pud Pirate</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> followed flour dutifully. The rest stuck with the hare and continued on the 
Mt Tom Trail across 165. Finally the FRBs realized they had become the DFLs. More hash rocket-scientists at work! They 
followed the horns and whistles and backtracked west on 165 until the found the trail. They all ran up the ridge to 
the last of the Mt Tom Cliffs for second Beer Check in the sunset. Again, no <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> or 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>.</p>

<p>After brief refreshment, made briefer because they hare was running low on beer, they tracked in the dark, on east 
with a brief bushwhack to the hare’s truck on Mt Tom Rd. They drove back to start. Most unfortunately, <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were there. They quickly sprung apart, and got out 
of the steamy truck. Their litany of excuses immediately begun, was cut short by demands for the circle. Ratings for 
the run:  loss of two, two BC’s, and a sunset over lovely cliffs vs. too short, not enough beer, clear weather, 
optional shiggy. Total <b>6.9</b>. Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> for bringing <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font>.</p>

<p>The On On On was of course at Marks, exit 6 not 6A, only <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> abstaining because of 
embarrassment, no doubt. Beer wars were instituted. Prolonged singing was almost inevitable, with much appreciation 
from the crowd of regulars who requested repeat appearances every Monday. Poor fools, they may get more than they 
bargained for.</p>
