<i>The Manly Man is a swaggering man, carrying himself with pride and self-assurance.</i></p>

<p>The run was another man’s run, for manly men only. No women dared brave the wrath of the hare <font color="#FF0000">
Tinker</font>, known for his bizarre checks, his toxic shiggy and his blatant disregard for private property laws and 
other girlish niceties of civilization. No, this run was for MEN! Aha! It threatened rain. The men of the RIH3 laugh at 
bad weather! Ha! Ha! So it was that the masculine group gathered in the upper parking lot of the Oak Hill Tavern, and 
broke wind together, laughed loudly and deeply together, and adjusted their testicles together, awaiting the start.</p>

<p><i>The manly man goes where he wants, wears what he wants and says what he wants with no fear of condemnation.</i></p>

<p>Off at six-thirty, they ran briefly (but in a manly way) out north on Rt 1, and following the hare’s instructions, 
turned right just opposite Haverhill Ave. Led by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
they entered the woods. Trail led between two small ponds. A check caused some chaos, but soon trail was found coming onto 
the east-west railroad grade so often encountered during Wickford hashes. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> guessed 
right and soon called On-On.  The rest of the men followed. And then, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> found an arrow 
pointing north. He called the men across a small canal, into a brief bushwhack.</p>

<p><i>The manly man is not a follower and may not be a leader but, is undeterred by external forces or obstacles.</i></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> continued straight for a while and then tried to rejoin the group. Unfortunately 
for the group, he was able to find them as they emerged confused from the clockwise circle jerk that brought them back to 
the grade.  They continued east. It got worse. They encountered the hare. They came to another check. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> went straight. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> turned north along the banks of a pond. But of course, it was a “Tinker Check”. 
Finally realizing this, they turned back, and found trail coming out into a cul-de-sac that ultimately circled southeast 
onto Prospect St.</p>

<p><i>The Manly Man is not a quitter. Comfort and difficulty do not deter the Manly Man. He does his job to the fullest.
</i></p>

<p>Trail was followed now southwest on Prospect. A check led to confusion, particularly after the hare was sighted in his 
car. Was there some auto-hashing going on? Not with these manly and man-like men! They turned left on Ashton at first. 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> continued straight. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> waited for someone to call on. They ultimately turned back to Prospect and, with <font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font> picked up true trail east on Annaquatucket. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was on Amy (in a manly way, of 
course). He too heard the call, and followed. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> knew enough (inside information?) to 
head for the High School, and he caught up with the men as they milled around the back parking lot of the school.</p>

<p><i>The Manly Man does not bitch. He does not whine or moan about the task at hand but rather works beyond the call of 
duty. His attitude is "can do" or even better "will do".</i></p>

<p>Finally marks were rediscovered. They led east between the track and the tennis courts. A large figure was sighted 
ahead. It was <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>! Had he been hitching a ride? Or was it simply blind luck? We may never 
know. At any rate, he assured the rest that there was no trail northwards, and suggested that the group concentrate their 
search at the southeast border of the playing fields. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry 
Foot</font> immediately turned north. The rest followed.</p>

<p>Trail was found on Fairway, heading northeast. They crossed Rt 1A. Marks continued into a neighborhood on Elm Drive. 
They met <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. How had HE got there? Was there a rocket concealed in his stick?</p>

<p><i>The Manly Man forges his own destiny. He does not rely on public aid and socialistic programs. He is most likely a 
Republican.</i></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> assured the group that there were no marks to the left, and suggested they continue 
straight. They immediately turned left. Trail led past a few houses and then into the woods. On a peninsula in a small 
pond they encountered a very manly castle-shaped structure; a sort of he-man gazebo. It would have been a brilliant beer 
check. They all looked carefully around it, not believing the hare had not taken advantage. Sadly trail led on, into 
someone’s back yard, and then out onto Cold Spring Lane, at the Wickford Alzheimer’s Center (the hare’s home away from 
home).</p>

<p><i>The Manly Man lives with the cards he is dealt.</i></p>

<p>Running through the Center’s parking lot, trail was temporarily lost. Most scouted around the Wickford Public Beach, 
assuming that beer could not be far away. But there was more pain to come. Luckily, these men can take it! <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> finally picked up trail west on Beach. An arrow pointed north on Steamboat, and they ran 
northeast over street after street all the way out to the end of Poplar Point. Finally, they found the hare’s car. And the 
Beer Check. On of the hare’s old neighbors had traded up. He unwisely had agreed to allow the hash to decamp upon his 
sea-wall. And so they did.</p>

<p>Questionable beer choices and pretzels were shared. The baseball game could be seen on the host’s TV through the 
window. Manly Singing began.</p>

<p><i>The Manly Man likes to be entertained. He likes manly music. His music is a reflection of his way of life. It is not 
the Top-40 music made for the masses. It is honest, loud and individual. Sometimes it is off-color.</i></p>

<p>And then the hare suggested that they circle up here, as well. Oh, the travesty! But they moved down to the pebbled 
“beach” and circled. Partly in the cold water. No sweat for the manly! Ratings for the run: no shiggy, no trail after the 
BC, too much asphalt, wasted manly castles, and unpleasant close encounters with <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, could only be counter-balanced by the “Tinker Checks” and the farthest distance EVER 
traveled by a hare. [Until Snotty finally sets a trail, for crying out loud!] Total: <b>-0.69</b>. Hashit: No one could 
prove the various charges of auto-hashing, inside info, short-cutting, etc. So hashit of course went to the least manly: 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> drove some back to pick up cars (taking <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, thus 
causing great rejoicing to those left behind, but causing great distress to the already psychotic Ben).</p>

<p><i>The Manly Man loves cars. The manly car can be almost any car, except such blatantly girl cars such as pink 
Cadillacs. Or lesbian cars. Like Subarus. Usually it is made in America. Most manly men can do up to 80 percent of their 
own mechanic work. Hot metal, burning oil and caustic chemicals are the manly man's world. Manly cars must serve their 
purpose first. The Manly Man does not need air conditioning, a stereo, or other worldly environmental controls.</i></p>

<p>They were finally all picked up, and were in time for once for the steak fry at the Oak Hill Tavern. It was a fine and 
manly way to finish. Cooking raw and dripping red meat outside on an open flame. Drinking beer with bits of popcorn and 
peanuts thrown in. Trying to get Bleu-cheese coated cherry tomatoes into <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> beer.</p>

<p><i>The Manly Man eats, he does not pick and sort his food. He knows how to order and can pick his own wine or drink. He 
likes spicy and robust foods and has a fondness for meat. He is not a vegetarian. If the Manly Man is required to prepare 
the food he prefers to cook with fire and may even use a red hot exhaust manifold under the hood of his car. The only 
magic he might use is the microwave, because of the possibility this method carries for "blowing things up".</i></p>

<p>Baseball on the TV with the Red Sox winning 11-1. Doesn’t get more manly than this! Well, maybe if there had been an 
action movie on.</p>

<p><i>The Manly Man also likes movies. There are a few things that distinguish a manly movie. Number one is smoke. A manly 
movie must have some form of smoke. It may come from tires, guns, fires or best of all explosions. The manly movie should 
also have women. But that part is optional.</i></p>

<p>Sorry <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>! Sorry <font color="#FF0000">Cum Under</font>! Sorry, <font color="#FF0000">
Swallows</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Deep Throat</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Mother Goose</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bungy</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Shine On</font>! Sorry <font 
color="#FF0000">P.W.</font>! We hereby announce the RI All-men’s hash! (Don’t worry, ladies. You can visit any time you 
like. P.W.? You’re out of luck! The Manly Man loves women (not girls) and they are his weakness. The Manly Man must 
develop discipline in this area. The undisciplined man may become diluted and may become <font color="#FF0000">Hen 
Pecked</font>. (<font color="#FF0000">P.W.</font>!) At this point he is no longer manly, but is a servant to the woman. 
The Manly Man does not hit his woman. The Manly Man does not abuse his status or power. He need not rape, beat up or use 
violence to get his way. If the Manly Man is truly manly (and real women can readily recognize a Manly Man) he usually has 
enough women to suit his needs.)</p>

<p><i>Now having the outline to being a Manly Man: Go, young man and be an example of Manliness to all those whipped 
Girlie Boys.</i></p>
