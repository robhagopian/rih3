<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#3333FF">Present</font>:&nbsp; the
hare; <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Bondo Jovi, Async, Oozing</font> (yours
truly), <font color="#FF0000">PW, TinkerBell, DrWHOSlasher, Just Jeremiah</font>
(shoot him, he's <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> son!), <font color="#FF0000">ShortPeck,</font>
and returnee <font color="#FF0000">Flaming Arsehole</font>. And of course the 4
k9's...
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF">The Run:
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, the start again was classic <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.&nbsp;
The HHH sign quite visible on the post if you were one of the runners cumming
from the opposite d'erection... ahhh WIPOS!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We had already a cop (<font color="#FF0000">Jeremiah</font>)
but another showed up just as <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> exposed his
member to pee on <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> van! Good thing it has
shrunk beyond recognition that the copper could barely see anything at all!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, at 0630pm, the hash was sent back on the
h'way towards Rt. 4 and into the park and soon onto trail and a check that took
all the hash on the falsies as the trail led back on the h'way back to the
start! A clever circle check, the wank! The trail this time wound around the
cars and into the woods and around a river and onto a circle, straight thru to
another circle&nbsp; jerk back to a check and northwards onto true trail. <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>by this time was as good as lost, once again!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hash ran around more trail, including sand
dunes and into an opening that led to the BC.&nbsp; Beer consumed, the pack sans
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>went out onto trail, thru more checks with <font color="#FF0000">Async
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">FlamingA*£Le</font> leading, to a ancient
graveyard and the 2nd BC (yipee). Still no sight of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>,
the pack consumed more beer and headed back to the start where <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>,
with <font color="#FF0000">Baxter</font> and Ben came sauntering along. The
circle was in a stinking snapping turtle infested swamp, where the hare did his
downdowns as did the hashit( bondo) and an attempt to name Jeremiah led to
naught (too many beers!). The ONON was at a bar in Wickford where food and beer
was enjoyed by all!&nbsp; A lengthy discussion about our 800th was also held and
it promises to be quite the weekend.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">PW</font> skipped the on-on to help console the lovely
young wives, girlfriends and significant others left all alone on another Monday
night.</font></p>
