<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first snow of the season arrived this Monday
night at the most Northwestern corner of Rhode Island, at the <font color="#CC0000">Basket
Boom Boom</font> compound, and along with it a future GM, but later on for that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Hare, <font color="#CC0000">Async</font>,
laid trail in what he called VIRGIN territory bordering Snake Den Park in
Johnston.&nbsp; This being the first post-Thanksgiving Day Hash had quite a
number of turkeys show.&nbsp; Not all turkeys saw their fate at this holiday
season, and that just goes to show you, the good die young. Our turkeys included
<font color="#CC0000">Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Little Neck, P.W., Tinker (bell),
Oozing Syph, Basket </font>(late again), and our leader <font color="#CC0000">Jake</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The pack waited for <font color="#CC0000">Basket </font>for
what seemed like hours to<font color="#CC0000"> Bondo</font>, and was about 1 ½
minutes to the rest, and after that terminal wait, they were off and strolling.
The trail led the merry band back down the street. A check had all confused,
except <font color="#CC0000">Oozing</font> who always manages to find trail,
mostly because the others including <font color="#CC0000">Little Neck, Bondo</font>,
and <font color="#CC0000">WIPOS</font>, have their little heads up their asses
and &quot;Hang Check&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The trail followed a well-worn path into the
woods and skirted the <font color="#CC0000">Async</font> famous Snake Den. After
a short jaunt through the woods, they came upon a large mountain. They couldn’t
go around it; they couldn’t go under it, so they ran up it, to many &quot;What
the Fuck!&quot;s from our Brewmeister, <font color="#CC0000">Bondo</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#CC0000">Tinker</font> had been seen hobbling along dead last when
he decided to keep to the Low Road. This shows the need for education, as the
pack soon followed his advice and was running along the lower valley floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A couple of checks later had the pack confused,
but Jake this time found true trail over to a rocky overlook, and all found
flour going once again uphill. This time <font color="#CC0000">Tinker </font>decided
to take the High Road, and being just behind the lumbering <font color="#CC0000">PW</font>,
found that being downwind from that firm yet volatile butt could be dangerous
for one's health. The trail continued along the ridge until the Beer Stop was
found overlooking (you might see it if it were light out) a great scenic view.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Beers were opened, and a distant bellowing of a
moose or some animal in distress could be heard off in the distance.
Conversation ran from <font color="#CC0000">Bondo’s</font> &quot;What the
fuck, we’ve been here before!&quot; to<font color="#CC0000"> Little Neck’s</font>
&quot;I told you the beer stop would be up here!&quot; to <font color="#CC0000">Async’s</font>,
&quot;Was that Basket’s horn?&quot; A short while later <font color="#CC0000">Basket</font>
arrives from the rear. It is his best approach, and he quickly grabbed a beer.
Before he had a chance to enjoy the splendor of a cold yet robust Pete’s
Wicked, he was handed the Down-Down vessel for missing the last hash and was
renamed Cyclops for his recent misadventures. It seems that having been under
general anesthesia in the hospital is insufficient cause to miss the hash, or
gain a little compassion from this group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Last weeks Hash had its golden nectar spilled on
the ground while under the watchful eye of the ever vigilant DEM’ers, and the
fact that Johnston’s Finest had already made its presence noted this evening,
the circle was held at the Beer Stop instead of the end. Down-downs were given
to the 3 who had not the &quot;Gift of the Blarney Stone&quot; and for their
crime of &quot;Alcohol Abuse&quot; from last week. <font color="#CC0000">PW</font>
got one for getting, dare we say it…the &quot;M&quot; word, but then he’s
always been Pussy Whipped so it doesn’t matter that he’s made it a permanent
lifestyle. <font color="#CC0000">Little Neck</font> got one for his incessant
whining and <font color="#CC0000">Async</font> for his role in this
&quot;Virgin&quot; Hash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A swing low followed and the pack started out
once again, downhill along the Power Lines and crossing a knee-deep river, not
quite frozen as temperatures were still at mid-thirties (thank you Hare). A few
dry foot fairies found that going along the high ground was not only dryer, but
also shorter, and arrived at the car park before the remainder of the sloshing,
complaining, frozen pack. The hare chose to regroup at Swampy’s in Greenville
for libations and we were out of their wet cloths and into their cars quicker
than Shine On could say, &quot;I did not blow Rumson!&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Barmaid at Swampy’s remembered us from
previous stops here, and asked if we were going to wrap everyone in toilet paper
again, or stand up on the tables mooning the patrons, not that she minded our
antics though, as she was eyeballing Tinkers cute butt at the time. Food and
Murphy’s Stout were soon being enjoyed, and a moderate sing-fest followed. The
HASHIT was given to last week’s hare Oozing for displaying his Pakistani fault
of polluting the environment. Then the phone rang and the waitress asked if
&quot;Bill&quot; was here. Remembering that my mother use to call me that in my
&quot;PreHashDays&quot;, I answered and found <font color="#CC0000">Dog Meat</font>
insistent that I leave the fellowship of the Hash and go home directly. My
daughter was there and she was waiting for me. Finishing my stout, I jumped in
the car thinking that a catastrophic event must have occurred and an urgent
response was necessary. I arrive to find my children (yes I have procreated)
bought a puppy Saint Bernard for my birthday, and the cute little 7 week old
bundle was looking for a good place to shit and my oriental rug looked just fine
to him. He hasn’t had a beer yet, but as his father weighed 175 lbs., and his
mother 160, I’m sure he’ll make a fine Grand Master with a &quot;Don’t
leave the camp&quot; hash mentality…when Jake’s ready to retire that is.
OnOn!</font></p>
