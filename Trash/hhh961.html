<p>Trail started off in the School Street Medical building in Pawtucket. Flour led west to a path in the woods, where 
a check mark confused several who turned south away from the obvious noise and confusion of the Chinese Festival. 
Nevertheless, most were able to find their way north on trail, which led to <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> 
campsite at the shaded part of the State Pier.</p>

<p>Food was provided along with beer, and the group downed a few, and prepared for the r*ces by getting out their 
grass skirts, coconut bras and leis. The first heat was not until 10:30, so there was plenty of time to prepare. A few 
boom boxes were tried, but none could generate sufficient volume for playing the Hawaii 5-0 theme on the water. The 
group was forced to listen to some bizarre folk-music provided by <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.</p>

<p>With a half hour to go, the group headed out to the main area in formation, the first-team members hand picked for 
their ability to stand in a line when asked. The staging area reached, they formed a circle, and led by <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> performed their first (of many) renditions of the Haka. This is a Maori War-Chant, used 
by the New Zealand Rugby Team. &nbsp;It obviously fitted well with the theme of Hawaiians paddling in Chinese boats. 
Or so it seemed to <font color="#FF0000">Basket.</font> And the audience was most appreciative. They also enjoyed 
“Father Abraham” as performed by 25 people in grass skirts.</p>

<p>The first heat went off on time. In lane one, the hashers showed their stuff and handily crushed their opposition: 
the Pawtucket Police Department and the Corridor MisFITTs a group of well-meaning women who were either cowed by the 
Maori War-Chant or afraid of <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> steering. Victory meant semifinals, and a few 
hours later the team, with substitutions, was back in the circle. The Haka was again mutilated with great vigor and 
enthusiasm. (So much so that the organizers of the stage show later insisted that it be re-enacted on stage under the 
big-top for the seated audience of parents and children. Another triumph for the RIH3. But I digress.)  This time, the 
group performed the “Lion Hunt”. Again, some of the audience were perplexed. Several of <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO’s</font> patients were seen looking for a new surgeon in the Yellow Pages.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/961/dragon1_small.jpg" width="400" height="267"></p>

<p>The second heat was against the second boat of the NYC Metropolitan Area Dragons (“Absolutely M.A.D.) and the local 
team from Riverfront Lofts. The locals were no problem. But due to a combination of being in (perfect) position on 
the starting line too early, and bribery, corruption and incompetence on the part of the starters, the hash boat was 
caught with their skirts up and pants down at the start. Despite a valiant effort, they were beaten by the New Yorkers 
by four seats (1/4 boat length). It was a travesty. And it certainly couldn’t have been the effects of 5 hours of beer 
for some of the hashers.</p>

<p>The day wore on, and after the aforementioned stage performance, the consolation heat was a disappointment, with 
another close second to the “Peking P’Rowers” With all the collective time the hashers had put into training (some had 
spent total times upwards of 69 minutes of intensive training in the weeks before!) one would have thought it a 
foregone conclusion that we would win. But by this time, with the beer stocks running low, most were relieved not to 
actually have to perform the Haka again.</p>

<p>While some of the team headed for home, the hardcore stayed for the awards. Those who left missed: the cleanup, 
the Trinity brew, the awards, the circle, more songs, less Haka, the theft of Chinese Flags and near theft of the Red 
Bull tent, and the progressive and embarrassing intoxication of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, Fuwangi</font> and 
Just <font color="#FF0000">SESYB’s</font> Roommate’s Boyfriend which continued throughout the evening and spread 
humiliatingly to the East Avenue Café and thence to Waterfire in Providence. But just wait ‘till next year!</p>
