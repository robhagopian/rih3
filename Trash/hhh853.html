<p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size="4"><b>In the beginning…</b></font><br>
<font face="TimesNewRoman" size="3">God was alone. Not 
having a beer to drink or anything like that, he was bored out of his gourd, so 
he created the universe. In it he made stars and planets in spinning solar 
systems, that were pretty neat and fun to look at, but still didn’t give him the 
satisfaction of a good beer. So then God made the earth with lots of H<sub>2</sub>O, 
and put life therein, including the blessed yeast to make beer.<br><br>

<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> wasn’t around yet, so he didn’t have a good 
recipe to work with, but he knew that water was only part of the picture. So he 
pushed aside the seas and created the firmament, on which to plant barley. The 
barley grew and grew, but was soon taken over by weeds, and God would have none 
of that. He made animals, of all kinds to eat the wild weeds, and then made a 
buddy to drink the beer with, and called him Adam. And God was happy.<br><br>

Adam was running 
through the fields of barley, naked and alone, because God didn’t want him to 
see God just yet. He knew that might scare him, and a beer would settle things 
nicely, but he had plenty of time for that later. Adam was cutting down the 
barley and cooking it up with the water and yeast, and then he grabbed some 
funny smelling things off a vine. He called those hops, because it seemed to 
grow on long vines that hopped from tree to tree. Adam threw some of these into 
his vat of water and yeast and barley, and when he let it sit for a couple days, 
it tasted really good. And Adam was happy.<br><br>

Now God saw Adam 
drinking all this beer, and still wasn’t ready to show himself until Adam 
perfected the recipe, so he decided to give Adam someone to clean up after, and 
bring him his dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp; God reached into Adam, while he was asleep, 
grabbed a rib, covered it with shiggy, and called it Eve. She was extremely 
smart. She could balance a beer glass on her head, and do all kinds of fun 
stuff, without spilling a drop. Pretty soon, Adam got so busy with Eve that God 
was alone again, and he didn’t like it very much, but Adam was ecstatic.<br><br>

Still, having so 
much time on his hands, God didn’t rush in to fix things just yet. He sat back 
and watched as the population grew and grew. Soon there were men and women 
everywhere. They covered the planet, and drank a lot of beer, but didn’t do much 
else. Then, finally, God began to get angry. So he looked out over the land to 
find some just men. Men that could run and drink beer at the same time, and he 
found one, in the northwest corner of Burrillville, Rhode Island. And he was 
called <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom </font>of RIH3.<br><br>

<b>God's Plan to Save Us…</b><br><br>

<font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font> found grace in the eyes of the 
Lord. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was a just man and perfect in his 
generations, and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> ran with beer and God loved 
him for that. The earth was corrupt before God, and it was filled with violence 
and sloth. God rewards people who run with beer and are good, but punishes those 
that are fat and lazy.<br><br>

Have you ever done 
something bad? When your parents found out about it, what happened? I don’t know 
about you, but I used to get spanked. Have you ever been spanked? Did your 
parents spank you because they didn’t love you anymore? No, they love you very 
much, but they wanted you to remember to do the right thing next time. They had 
to deal with your behavior so you would change it. (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
lesson one, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> loves to be spanked)<br><br>

When God looked at the world that He had made, he became sad about how bad 
things had become. He had to deal with the world’s sin. He loved
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and he had a plan to save us all, everyone.<br><br>

<font size="4"><b>The Big Tadoo</b></font><br><br>

God’s plan to save <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was to have him build an 
ark. God knew how to build it and what to use to build it. He gave
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> very detailed plans about how to build it. 
What if <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>had decided he would just build it 
the way that suited him? What if he had said, &quot;Lord, I’ll build this boat with 
bricks. It will be the strongest boat ever!&quot; The boat would surely need to be 
strong, but the bricks would not be light enough to float in water. The boat 
would sink. Can’t you hear God saying, &quot;No, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, 
go for wood!&quot; (Gopher wood) Ha, ha! (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> joke)<br><br>

God always knows what to do, and he will tell us. So we should pray to know what 
God wants us to do. If we pray we won’t make mistakes and sin. God told
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to prepare a place for all the animals. How 
many animals of each kind did Basket bring? Yes, two pairs of every kind, male 
and female, but mostly sheep and goats and cows. God wanted to have them for the 
New World that would come after the flood. He had <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
bring plenty of food for them also. God always provides for us. Even now He has 
prepared a place for all people who love Jesus and will come to get us one day, 
just as He came for the animals and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing
</font>lesson 2, don’t forget the females)<br><br>

<b>Too much shiggy…</b><br><br>

God’s plan was for <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> to construct a large 
vessel that would hold all the different kinds of animals. About 75,000 animals 
would need to go on the ark. Could it hold that many animals? Could
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>build such a boat? God gave
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>a head start. He told <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> when he was 480 years old that in another 120 years the judgment 
would come. When Noah was 500 years old he began to have children: three sons. 
Then the <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> &amp; Sons Ark Supply Company began its 
task to build the ark. No one had ever seen much rain before. The earth had a 
mist, daily dew that would come, but that was it. They laughed at
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and his boat. Sometimes people may laugh at 
Christians and Moslems for doing the right thing, but what is important is that
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>obeyed God. We should obey God also, no 
matter what other people think.<br><br>

God told <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> exactly how to build the ark: it 
was about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet tall. It would have three 
decks, and a window for air. It only had one door. Through that door, all who 
entered would be saved. All who stayed behind would die. It only had one 
bathroom, which made things pretty messy downstairs, so most everyone, including 
the animals tried to get up by the window.<br><br>

The ark’s size made it six times longer than it was wide. This made it very 
stable in the water. If a large wave tried to turn it over, it would right 
itself. It would tend to position itself to face the waves. Even winds, blowing 
three times stronger than a hurricane, would not turn the ark over, but did make 
the smell a little better. The ark did not have a rudder to steer it. It only 
had to float.<br><br>

God was the pilot, 
not <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> because <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>was still drinking lots of beer and visiting the sheep. Do you have 
trouble giving the steering wheel to God? Pretend you are in the ark, with 
nothing to grab hold of except God. The ark had room for 750 railroad cars of 
cargo. It could have easily held 180,000 sheep, and you wouldn’t get much sleep. 
There was room for all the animals, and hay and corn to feed them. Most of the 
animals would nap and hibernate during the rocky ride. But how did Noah get all 
the animals on board? God supernaturally directed the animals to come to the 
ark, and promised them sex and beer. He brought them in to save them from the 
flood. (<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> lesson 3, sheep are good)<br><br>

<b>The Perfect Storm…</b><br><br>

So <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>built the ark, then his family went in the 
ark seven days before the flood when he was 600 years old. God brought in the 
animals and the Lord shut him in. The flood was the second worst disaster ever 
recorded in history. The <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi </font>AGM trail still 
holds the record for worst disaster ever. The entire earth was covered with 
water and there were no survivors except those on the ark. The fountains of the 
great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and the animals were surely frightened, but 
extremely happy with lots of beer and Vaseline. Great earthquakes hurled ash 
high in the air and it rained, as it never has. Even the waters under the earth 
came out of the ground. The water rose to a height that covered the mountains. 
The waters rose and the ark floated for 150 days, or five months.<br><br>

Even when it came to rest on the top of the Johnston Landfill, it was not safe 
for Basket to leave the ark. <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>obeyed God and 
stayed in the ark until 375 days after the rain began, and just before the beer 
ran out The Ark slipped down the side of the Landfill and finally stopped at 
Pacheco Park in North Smithfield.<br><br>

When they finally 
went out of the Ark, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> took the flour and laid 
trail. The sodden ground sucked up the flour and Baskets shoes like Eve did 
Adam, but <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>kept on. When
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>finally made it back to Pacheco Park, the
<font color="#FF0000">Fat One</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>,
<font color="#FF0000">Crème Whora Mr. Rogers</font> and Shine On had already 
left the Ark and started out looking for the new beer. <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing, Friar </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Summers Eve Seven Year Bitch</font> 
were confused from the smell, as they were in the bottom of the Ark, and they 
waited for<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> to return. Finally, they all went 
out and followed the trail <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had lain that 
day. And the trail was good.<br><br>

The pack made their 
way through the ball field and forest, stopping once or twice to find true 
trail, as the cunning <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> tested their faith. 
Then they came to the Slatersville Reservoir Upper Falls, and saw the early pack 
drinking the new beer on the opposite bank. They all swam across and enjoyed the 
Beer <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> Brought. And it was good.<br><br>

Now when they 
finished the beer, they gave<font color="#FF0000"> Basket</font> a 10-minute 
head start, and proceeded to catch him, for he knew where the rest of the beer 
was hid. As they ran through the sand and gravel yard, a toothless guard stopped
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and asked him if he knew where he was.
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> told him about the Ark and the beer and 
especially the sheep, and the guard got all glassy-eyed and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>slipped away, just as the pack was getting 
really really close.<br><br>

<b>The Big Finish…</b><br><br>

They ran down Tiff Road and just as they got close to catching<font color="#FF0000"> 
Basket</font>, he ran up a driveway and asked a homeowner if he could bring his 
friend along the lake trail. The homeowner was with God and he knew of
<font color="#FF0000">Basket’s </font>final trek, so he let him go. The pack 
chased <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>back to Pacheco Park, where everyone 
was wet and dry, because of the rain and no more beer. So <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>took everyone back to his house for food and beer. And it was good.<br><br>

Let's be ready when <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> sets trail again. Don't miss the boat!</p>
