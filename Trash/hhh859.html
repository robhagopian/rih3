<font color="#0000ff">Weather:</font> &nbsp;High 70's, Clear - a beautiful humid evening.<br>
<font color="#0000ff">Present: </font>&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS, Oozing, Trail

<p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">The Run:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font> the hare had planned to run the usual hash from his house. He was relying on 
the fact that they never clean the streets of Woonsocket, and flour and chalk traces from the last four hashes there are 
still visible and therefore reusable with no effort. Unfortunately, he forgot that Woonsocket's Columbus Day Celebration 
and Parade is a major public event. Representatives from the town council had heard that he would not be going to Ohio as 
he has for years on Columbus Day. They came to his home on Sunday and warned him (threatening a visit to his basement 
from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) to get out of town completely at least until 4PM. Forced from his home, 
he decided to set trail from Joe’s Rock in Wrentham at 2:00, figuring to come back to run the recycled trail from Cold 
Spring Park at the usual 6:30 time.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> arrived promptly at 1:45. The parking lot was almost full. But no hashers.&nbsp; 
Apparently, a pilgrimage to Joe’s Rock is the thing to do in Wrentham on Columbus Day. The hare came out of Birchwold 
Farm across the street at 1:55. It looked like it was going to be a nearly perfect hash, <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> alone, gamboling in the woods with lots of beer. Unfortunately at about 
2 minutes past the hour, like that sudden uncomfortable wetness that sometimes manifests after a Bondo-beer fart, <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>arrived. He was soon joined by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and then visitors: <font 
color="#FF0000">EB RIPTA</font> and a second timer, <font color="#FF0000">Just A.J.</font>&nbsp; [<font color="#FF0000">
Just A.J.</font> had had his virgin hash only the day before, with Newport. It had been hared in Tiverton by the <font 
color="#FF0000">Sweet and Adorable One</font>. His experience had been somewhat marred by the fact that he had chosen to 
follow <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> for much of that run. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was participating 
in this Newport event only because it was in his neighborhood and he knew the area so well. Accordingly, he got himself 
so lost he almost missed the circle. <font color="#FF0000">Just A.J.</font> wasn’t sure, but he thought that this might 
not be the way hashing was supposed to work.  <font color="#FF0000">RIPTA </font>had recommended trying again. They 
showed up for this hash, figuring that <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>has sustained too much blood loss in Tiverton 
to run two days in a row. But I digress.] The group set off across the street about 15 minutes late.</p>

<p>Trail was well marked, further proof of the hare’s progressive dementia. They ran south into the fields on paths that 
were well groomed. Checks served their purpose, keeping all together at first. But when they finally came out onto a 
powerline, <font color="#FF0000">Just A.J.</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO </font>were in the lead, <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">EB RIPTA</font> were following leisurely, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was lost. Meanwhile, at the parking area, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font 
color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> had arrived. They followed the HHH arrow and crossed into Birchwold Farm, and ran 
through the other parking lot.&nbsp; Lo and behold, the svelte form of the hare sneaking the beer to the BC could be seen 
in the distance! They saw no reason to run an actual hash, so they chased the hare. They had almost caught up with him 
just as <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>emerged from the woods far from any flour. They all managed to come together 
at the Beer Check atop a rock on the south side of the powerlines.</p>

<p>Back on true trail, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Just A.J.</font> traded the lead like 
a well-oiled machine, effortlessly coping with checks and falsies. Another example of how chance favors the unprepared 
half-mind. They made their way rapidly through the woods southeast across a streambed, up some single-track back towards 
the powerlines then fully south into the woods. The MA/RI border stone was passed on a dirt road and they soon turned 
west, now in Cumberland.&nbsp; The hare most unfortunately ignored the nearby Burnt Swamp and its brook that could have 
provided some much-needed moisture for the arid feet of the hashers.</p>

<p>A “Private Property Keep Out!” barrier was encountered and ignored as they made their way west. Crossing back into 
legal territory, the trail led north. More checks were dealt with brilliantly.  Finally, on what appeared to still be true 
trail, the FRB’s found themselves with Ben back on the powerlines at the check that had initially sent them into the 
woods. This wasn’t right. They looked north. False. South was wrong for sure. They checked east. No trail at all (but 
lots of briars, which successfully started <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> bleeding again. Perhaps he should be 
renamed the <font color="#FF0000">Bleeder Dr WHO.</font>). They tried bushwhacking in sundry directions off the cardinal 
points, all to no avail. “R.U.?” was sounded frequently with no response. Finally, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> 
advised that they repeat the loop and redo all the checks. What a knucklehead! They headed back southeast. [It might be 
instructive at this point, for <font color="#FF0000">Just A.J. </font>and for any new or prospective hashers who happen 
to be reading this, to review the Official Rules of Rhode Island Hashing. They are as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #1. Never follow Dr 
WHO.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #2. NO Poofters!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #3. There is NO Rule #3!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #4.&nbsp; Never follow 
Basket Boom Boom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #5. NO Poofters!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #6. NO trespassing unless 
absolutely convenient.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #7. Never follow any RI 
Hasher (they are likely to be Poofters).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #8. There are NO rules!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule #9. NO Poofters!<br>
Amen.]</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the BC, <font color="#FF0000">EB RIPTA </font>and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> had arrived.
&nbsp; After a time, <font color="#FF0000">RIPTA </font>grew worried, feeling responsible for the new boot. <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>grew restive (not having actually run at all this trail). The two set off, backtracking to 
find the lost wankers (while <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> tried to look exhausted, and <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> pretended to be searching for examples of poison ivy in the 
neighboring bushes).  <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>made it past the No Trespassing zone, where he met the two 
missing hashers nearing completion of their second loop. He wondered how they could have missed the giant arrow to the 
BC. With geometric precision and unanswerable logic, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> proved beyond ANY shadow of a 
doubt not only that there COULD NOT have been ANY SUCH ARROW, but also that the hare was a heinous pedophilic deviant 
(whose recent problems with impotence and homosexual ideation moreover made him a likely candidate to be the Beltway 
Sniper). <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>followed them to a giant arrow (obviously a fabrication ONLY MINUTES OLD, 
based on the grain pattern and the recent winds, barometric pressure and relative humidity). They turned left and soon 
joined the group at the beer check at the top of a huge rock.</p>

<p>The beer check was relatively sedate, with a few songs and little rude behaviour. In part this was because of the scant 
level ground atop the boulder where the hare had sited the check. But mostly it was because the crowds of children and 
young families who had paid their respects to Joe’s Rock had begun to arrive. Their apparent goal was to climb “Joe’s 
second favorite Rock”, the coincidental location of the beer check. Now suppose for a moment that you were a parent. If 
you saw <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> atop a rock in the woods, would 
you encourage your 6-year-old daughter to join them up there?&nbsp; (More than once that afternoon, an innocent child could 
be heard to ask: “What’s a dickie-di-do, Mommy?” as he or she climbed down from the perch of the hashers.)</p>

<p>On out was straight back across the powerlines, through the fields, and to the Birchwold parking lot. The hashers 
gathered at the hare's car awaiting his arrival (apparently the empty beer canister slowed his progress through the woods 
substantially). Attempts were made to retrieve the beer from his car to no avail, although a small tear in the screen of 
the right rear window was mysteriously enlarged and somehow the HHH cone was temporarily misplaced. The hare arrived, and 
they decided to circle at the hare's house. They went to the cars across the street and convoyed to Woonsocket.<br>

<p>In Woonsocket, <font color="#FF0000">DogMeat</font> and Rhode Island's newest hasher, Seamus St. Bernard greeted them. 
The circle was formed and ratings begun. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just A.J.</font> 
admitted that they liked the run so much they did it twice, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
EB RIPTA </font>were extraordinarily charitable given the weather and lack of shiggy, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, 
Trail Hoover </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>were ignored as irrelevant. Overall, 6.9!&nbsp; Virgin/visitor 
in the circle: <font color="#FF0000">Just A.J. </font>was questioned: he knew his name mostly, was made to cum by <font 
color="#FF0000">RIPTA</font>, and calculated the square root of 69 as 8.7! He did a down down, apparently surprised that 
the RIH3 uses beer for this.[ The day prior, his down down consisted of a dixie cup filled with a mixture of soapy water, 
coke, and some foul liquid called &quot;Hooch!&quot;&nbsp; But I digress.] He was also unaware of the hashing tradition of 
singing after a down down. He fumbled briefly, but recovered nicely with 'Old Macdonald's Farm'.&nbsp; Hashit was produced 
and given briefly to Seamus (it fit him well) but ended up God knows where. The excuses were flying and <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font> probably was awarded the thing in absentia for all your scribe can remember.<br>

<p>With the circle complete, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> had to leave for family reasons (did he get the hashit?) 
and the group moved inside to sample some <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> chili/dynamites as an appetizer for the second 
run. Again, your scribe was not present for this hash. Your scribe KNOWS that someone will step in and chronicle the event 
(maybe by next Easter). But having some experience in <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> Woonsocket hashes, your scribe 
will describe what must have occurred:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run #859b, Later that day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hare: <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Location: Cold Spring Park, 
Woonsocket<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Present: The wanks from above, 
plus some other idiots.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Run:<br>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
They gathered at Cold Spring Park at 6:15. A few 
confused visitors from Boston arrived to join the ones who had cum twice.
<font color="#FF0000">Async, EverReady</font> and <font color="#FF0000">KNO</font> 
joined the group. They were off promptly south along the river, turning east on 
the RR tracks then uphill, crossing the river twice. The beer check was in
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> car, parked in a sand-and-gravel pit near 
Blackstone.&nbsp; There was no shiggy. Back south to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font>, 
they circled quickly. The gastrointestinal distress felt by those who had run 
both hashes and partaken of both Bondo-Brew and Bondo-chili had become quite 
acute. In fact, insufficient bathrooms were available. <font color="#FF0000">
Basket </font>had to dig a makeshift latrine in the backyard.
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>(given the hashit for overachieving with two 
hashes in a day) provided a toilet seat. It was disgusting. After, more food was 
provided, all enjoyed themselves into the wee hours of the night (9:30PM) and
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> got naked in the hot tub.
<font color="#FF0000">Just A.J.</font> vowed he had a great time and will be 
back for sure. The Boston hashers got drunk and had to be dragged into the 
garage to sleep it off. Honestly, now was that so hard?</p>
