<p><font color="#008000">Run #1118</font>, September 3, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Justin Basket’s Ass</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Burrillville Middle School</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Clear, 80’s</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO, Amish It Head, Async, Bondo Jovi, Fuwangi, Swamp Whine, Eeenie 
Weenie Dick, Ben. <font color="#0000FF">Visitors:</font> Friar F*ck. The Fat One,  Shine On, Zena, …and Ben! 
<font color="#0000FF">Virgin:</font> Just Josh. <font color="#0000FF">Non-Participants:</font> 
DogMeat, Just Big Sh*t, Just Summer, Just Jodi, and the as yet unnamed Basket Grandchild. And others. Maybe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Another Labor Day. Another <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> run. Another visit to the Burrillville Middle School.</p>

<p>What more is there to say? Was it different or unusual? No. Did anything set it apart from the ordinary 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>-Labor-Day-BMS run? No. About the only thing changed was the fact that the hare was 
even more lazy than usual, and so was forced to live-set the trail. That, and we had a virgin that was obviously some kind 
of Narc or IRS man or something, as he kept trying to record parts of the hash. Weird!</p>

<p>The hare was given a generous ten minutes, and the pack was off at about 2:05. The first half of the trail would be 
best related in outline form:</p>

<p>1. Geography: The west trodden paths behind the Burrillville Middle School are familiar to every hasher, every 
nature-lover, every cardiac rehab walker and every juvenile delinquent north of Providence. The Branch River makes a 
bell-shaped curve oriented with a northwest apex and a long southwest tail. The land to the east is high, and to the west 
it descends into some light swamp. There are trails on both sides of the river, with a few skip areas.</p>

<p>2. The Pack: Apart from <font color="#FF0000">Just Josh</font>, every member of the pack has been here numerous times, 
and should have known better. They all know that the best approach to these trails is just to skip the whole thing, get in 
your car and head to the hare’s house, where the beer is colder, there’s food and the company is better. (Next time I’m 
with you <font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font>. I promise!) But if one must have one’s exercise, one can still think a bit. 
For some reason, the hare has always fixated on counterclockwise trails. So the obvious plan would be to go clockwise, 
from the track on the inner path and proceed until the hare is snared. Or just stand in the river at a straight stretch 
until you see the hare crossing down or upstream. Why no one did this is a mystery.</p>

<p>3. The Hare: Here’s what he has done, would do, and will do in the future. He starts from the northeast end of the 
parking lot. Counterclockwise trail, multiple checks resulting in multiple river crossings, no bushwhacking. Exit point is 
EITHER the running track OR the miniature railroad. No Beer Check will be found. This is always somewhere else.</p>

<p>OK, then. Yada, yada, yada. After several checks leading to several stream crossings, and several mid-stream hare 
sightings by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Friar</font>, 
trail made its counterclockwise loop and came back out by the running track. Now, onto the second part of the trail: Would 
the hare lead them back to his house? Or would it be to the cars? It was only this uncertainty, and the lack of beer that 
kept anyone following trail or even interested in the slightest.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> out 
of the middle school to the overgrown trolley track across the street and southwest along 102. A check had <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> headed for Bella’s; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> 
wouldn’t bite and turned left. They crossed the Victory Highway, and continued southwest, before turning into a dirt 
driveway. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> was close behind as <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> caught back up. They 
proceeded up the dirt paths to find the BC in a clearing.</p>

<p>The beer was opened as the stragglers gradually arrived. Some songs were started. <font color="#FF0000">Just Josh
</font> started recording. This made some of the professionals present slightly uncomfortable. The attempts at harmony 
were making everyone quite uncomfortable. But, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was missing. Every cloud has a silver 
lining. They finally finished up, and the hare pointed them back on trail. They were going back to the cars. So, most 
ignored the flour and just headed straight back, across Victory Highway, and through the recently emptied junk yard to the 
BMS.</p>

<p>The circle of course was at 290 Snake Hill. The run was rated: several contrived stream crossings, a virgin and a few 
bimbos could not make up for the recycled trail, clear weather, and lack of blood loss. Total: <b>-6.9</b>! Hashit: 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>. The virgin/FBI-man was questioned, and responded with a joke. The visitors were 
discouraged from coming again and religion ensued. Finally, a few of the desperate dipped into the frigid pool. Food was 
served, and vain efforts were made to entice Dogmeat to get naked in the pool. Another Monday holiday wasted.</p>

<p>Oh, and here’s what the Narc had to say:</p>

<p>Wednesday October 10, 2007<br>
Basket Boom Boom and his Merry Wankers</p>

<p>Running with the Rhode Island Hash House Harriers</p>

<p>Josh Wood, Art Director</p>

<p>I was waist deep in murky water when I realized two things. One, that I 
was glad I wore crappy shoes, and two, rocks are slippery. I had the 
cassette recorder in one hand and my car key in the other and held both 
above the surface of the water as I forded the stream. There was a 
shriek ahead of me and Shine On started to fall backwards as if in slow 
motion. I managed to keep her from falling into the lukewarm murk while 
saving my tape recorder from going under as well.</p>

<p>Shine On is a grandmother and a Hash House Harrier of a dozen plus 
years. She’s got battle wounds to prove it. “I’ve got still a scar on 
my upper right thigh. I sliced it open on a rock. I still have numbness 
– and that was eight years ago.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t really sure what to expect when I took off with the hashers 
behind Burrillville Middle School to the sound of a beat up hunting 
horn. I had read a little bit www.half-mind.com/Hashing/who.htm about 
the history of the Hash House Harriers running club. It was started by 
an English chartered accountant and his fellow ex-pats in Malaysia in 
the 1930s. Based on an old schoolyard game of hares and hounds, 
designated “hares” get a head start to mark a trail while the “hounds” 
track them down. Their biggest change to the game was the introduction 
of beer and general debauchery. The original 1938 charter 
harrier.net/presskit/shistory.html went something like this:</p>

<p>To promote physical fitness among our members<br>
To get rid of weekend hangovers<br>
To acquire a good thirst and to satisfy it in beer<br>
To persuade the older members that they are not as old as they feel</p>

<p>Since then, the Hash Houses have grown to an estimated 1,700 clubs 
around the world. Hares in the modern Hash Houses use flour, chalk or 
paper to mark a trail. A good trail has plenty of false leads, which 
keeps the pack guessing and keeps the hounds together regardless of 
their athleticism. Today’s Rhode Island Hash featured a “live hare,” 
Basket Boom Boom. A “live hare” means both hare and hounds were on the 
trail simultaneously. It’s an added bonus, Shine On explained, because 
upon catching the hare, the hounds earn the privilege of de-pantsing 
him.</p>

<p>It’s all a little disorienting for a virgin (a hasher’s term for a 
first timer). Hashing is infused with it’s own language and culture, 
and the hashers have handles like Amish Ithead, Fuwangii Boner, Swamp
Whine, Async, and Dr. Who. The fast runners are referred to as front 
running bastards, the phrase “are you?” is yelled to the front running 
bastards to see if a path has been found, and “on-on” is shouted back 
when a trail is confirmed. In the course of an hour, our trail cut 
through rocky logging trails, thorny underbrush, industrial sites piled 
with palettes and odd debris, sapling-choked thickets, gravelly 
roadsides, streams and wet places of questionable water quality, and 
backyards. Nothing is truly off limits, and wild places, referred to as 
shiggy, is the preferred terrain of the Hash. Visiting Boston hasher, 
The Fat One, showed his prize from a recent hash. Both of his forearms 
glowed scarlet with poison ivy. Meanwhile, calls of “on-on” and “are 
you?” echoed from the dozen or so hashers searching for marks in the 
undergrowth, as I worried about how many ticks I’d picked up through 
the last patch of tall grass.</p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure how long the run was, but eventually I came to a 
clearing in the woods where the front running bastards had gathered 
around containers of homebrew, pouring the dark ale into red plastic 
cups. Bondo Jovi is the designated brewer. “The Rhode Island Hash 
started 20 years ago – I wasn’t one of the founders, actually, myself 
and Basket are pretty much the originals from 20 years ago.” Apparently 
Bondo’s basement is fitted with enough brewing equipment to keep 
Bavaria buzzed for the next 100 years. As runners arrived, the group 
distributed the beer and immediately broke out into a medley about 
hair, S&M and bodily functions. Shine On explains that each Hash is 
different, and the Rhode Island Hash has a particular soft spot for 
home brew and song.</p>

<p>I recorded some of medley, but the Hash wasn’t exactly comfortable with 
my tape recorder. Last week two hares from the New Haven Hash were 
picked up by Connecticut authorities http://www.nhregister.com when the 
flour they were using to set trail in an Ikea parking lot was mistaken 
for Anthrax. So no one was really sure if I really was just a 
half-assed blogger, or an agent of Homeland Security. Hashing 
occasionally attracts the attention of the general public. “Sometimes 
we just tell people we’re running for Jesus,” Shine On added.</p>

<p>Post run, everyone met at Basket Boom Boom’s house for the circle and 
the on-in. The circle is an alcohol-infused ceremony and recap of the 
run. The hare’s work is graded by each hound, virgins and visitors are 
called out, and down-downs are assigned. A down-down is the ceremonial 
chugging of beverages; considered a reward or penalty, depending upon 
your point of view. Most importantly, the circle provides an 
opportunity for more beer and song. The on-in follows, which is 
basically another opportunity for beer and song. “Interesting things 
happen at the on-in,” mentioned the Friar, who told of some of the 
legendary on-ins of the past. He wasn’t kidding.</p>

<p>Rhode Island hashes happen every Monday at 6:30 PM. Check the Rhode 
Island Hash House Harriers Web rih3.com site to try the next one. And 
virgins, remember to bring crappy shoes and a change of clothes. And 
most importantly, never, ever, pass out at the on-in.</p>
