<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Some nice snow, 
a familiar spot, and no sign of <FONT color=#ff0000>Fuwangi</FONT> on his home 
turf.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And the hares used pink 
flour, guaranteeing that the color-blind <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> would 
soon be off on his own. What could ruin this hash? <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>! And the ever-whining <FONT color=#ff0000>Ben</FONT>, 
that’s what! Gathering at the North Cumberland Middle School, yet again, the 
hash was eyed suspiciously by the parents and children driving in for a 
basketball game or something. Soon enough, instructions were given and the hash 
was off, northwest on the usual trail into the woods.<?xml:namespace prefix = o

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The first check 
gave some hope that trail would enter Ash Swamp. But, no dice. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wee Balls</FONT> found true trail continuing on the slopes 
alongside the brook. Marks and footprints were easily followed, not that trail 
diverged from the straight northwest heading much, or even bushwhacked when 
feasible. <FONT color=#ff0000>Sloppy Rod</FONT> and <FONT color=#ff0000>Wee 
Balls</FONT>, never having been to this spot, stayed on trail. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>WHO </FONT>tried some of the paths with which he was all too 
familiar with little success. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> marched to the 
beat of his own drummer and was never seen to be on trail, even though he made a 
big show of it. <FONT color=#ff0000>Cumsocket</FONT> and <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Crack-her-toe-ah</FONT> stuck with the co hare. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Retard </FONT>stuck with <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT>. (It was 
indeed a happy day when the RIH3 christened him so 
perfectly!)<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">A few falsies 
led across the Ash Swamp Brook, but eventually, they made it up hill to find the 
hare and the Beer Check. It looked good for a while. But <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Retard</FONT> led <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> by random, 
cursed luck to the spot. The hares had prepared some props such as cigars, 
unhealthy snacks, etc. to ensure that no New Year’s resolution could go 
unbroken. Some songs were sung. And that was about it! The hare suggested 
retracing steps to get back! Boring!<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNoSpacing style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Most returned to 
the main trail, and continued southeast. <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> made it 
into a loop with an attempted shortcut that went wrong. <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Wrung Guy</FONT> got lost temporarily. But eventually, they were 
all back and waited for the circle just inside the woods behind the school. 
Ratings for the run: no virgin territory, out-and-back trail, no one lost and 
<FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> present were powerful arguments against the 
snow-shiggy and the three bimbos. Total: -0.69. Hashit was given to <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. He really needed it. Finishing up, they moved on to 
Pitchers Pub where yet again, the beer selection was great but the kitchen was 
closed except for appetizers. [Note to hares: if you call them in advance and 
say that 8-12 people will be coming in at 9 PM, they WILL keep the kitchen 
open!]<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
