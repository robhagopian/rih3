<p><i><font color="#0000ff">The Run: </font></i></p>

<p>This is the week when the seige at the Alamo ended but no-one survived. However, everyone survived this run/weekend. 
Too bad! After food and beer, it was decided that a run would be a good idea. Maybe it was the inability of seeing 5 
hashers trying to fix the keg without success, or the deliciously cold food everyone consumed or just to get everyone 
out of her mums house, but the hares decided to hash!!</p>

<p>A live trail it would be with one of the hares having no idea where the run was to be, this was going to be fun... And 
off they went! <font color="#FF0000">DT</font> had no flour, or chalk (how does she set runs in Bahstan? With her charm?). 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> is used to having women carry stuff around for him but with <font color="#FF0000">DT 
</font>it was to be different...</p>

<p>The pack set off after the hares, giving them barely 5 minutes lead. The first check, like the next five, were at the 
first intersection and trail was straight ahead on the road...boy, really challenging! The pack, soon bored with the 
trail, headed back to the house for a few more Trinity Ale. After another 15 mins and what seemed an eternity, the pack 
set out again. This time however, inebriated as they where, the pack soon was lost giving the hares more lead. They chose 
to spend this time getting &quot;acquainted&quot;, and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, considering flour holy, 
spread it all over his dainty co-hare, a good substitute for cream. There was a lot of flour, but there was also a lot of 
<font color="#FF0000">DT</font>, and so they ran out of flour! Moving off the road into the little shiggy they found, 
they heard the pack cum after them! The pack moved across the beach and more shiggy, then back thru somebody's yard and 
soon...NO MORE FLOUR!! Well, thinking quickly, they soon were knocking on a neighbour's house, a little 80 year old lady. 
She immediately took to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, but thought that <font color="#FF0000">DT </font>was weird 
and suspicious looking. Convincing her that she indeed was NOT a terrorist, but just a petty thug, <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> was also able to charm her to give him another pound of flour.</p>

<p>Back on trail, they were soon confronted by the hash, namely <font color="#FF0000">TrailHoover</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">OneDrunkWalking</font>. The latter took there flour and started to set the rest of tail and was not heard 
from till late into the night. Most of the pack aimlessly wandered around and found the ONIN. It was the only bar in town 
that was open, so it wasn't very difficult, except for the walkers <font color="#FF0000">Compost, MaryKay</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">LubeMeIn</font>. Compost had a great big smile on his face and the other two appeared worn out so 
it was obvious they had a strenuous walk!!</p>

<p>The circle was notable for an old, drunk woman who kept interrupting the circle. The pack loved the run (anything will 
please this pathetic bunch) and appropiate DOWNDOWNS to the hares, visitors from Ct and Ottawa, late cummers and the 
hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Wintoes69</font> for his desperate attempts to be the hash translater.</p>

<p>As expected from the Bahstan hash, the beer at the bar was, well, anything but beer. But at $5 a pitcher, you can't 
complain!! And so the pack soon moved back to the house with <font color="#FF0000">Lubey</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing </font>hitching a ride from <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>.</p>

<p>School colleagues of John Walker Lindh, the American-Afghan renegade, noted in the yearbook, as him being THE most 
likely one to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I would expect for <font color="#FF0000">DT</font> to have raised 
similar sentiments from her school chums. For she ended up making out with <font color="#FF0000">Puff N' Stuff </font>all 
night, who in turn was drinking <font color="#FF0000">Lube's</font> piss. But after drinking the shit we all drank at the 
bar, Lube's kidney filtered output must have been an improvement!!</p>

<p>There was beer consumption, pissing in the hallway, puking in the yard, and other regular hash activity late into the 
night. I could go on but I'm sick of typing so use your imagination, which you probably don't have so...</p>

<p>A good time had by all...</p>
<p>Quote of the night:&quot;Just my luck to be kissing a guy all night who had been drinking piss all along...&quot;
