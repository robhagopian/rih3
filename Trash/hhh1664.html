Like the french brewery Kronenbourg, RIH3's 1664 was watery and unappealing. However, a dozen hashers decided to show for this trail. After parking on the side of the road, trail went off into the woods, where after 2 marks it was lost to the whole pack. Despite Rusty having a headlamp brighter than the sun, he managed to miss several marks in the right direction. <br/><br/>

The trail wound through the bowels of CVS's corporate headquarters, where a few patches of forest remains to be one day swallowed up by more office buildings. After some time, we stumbled upon the whiskey check, and after "enjoying" the paddy's honey that was there, we were informed that there would be no whiskey.

The trail continued to wind around the area, through the powerlines, eventually landing us near the water tower for the beer check. We hung around there for a bit, dreading the tirty mile walk back on the pavement. We finally stumbled back as it began to snow, and after a circle back in the woods, made our way to Skeff's Neighborhood Pub, Manville Hill Rd, Cumberland, where the selection of beers was greatly appreciated by all WHO made it to the OnOn.
