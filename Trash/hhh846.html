<font color="#0000FF">Scribe:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Sunny, 80's, a little humid<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present: </font><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Basket, Bondo Jovi </font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async, 
PW, Dr Who</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The usual (if they could be called that) round of suspects joined <font color="#FF0000">Slasher Dr. 
WHO</font> in his sad attempt at being creative, at a hash trail behind Gardner's Restaurant, near the Monastery. He 
forgot the first rule, don’t try to be too cute, or you’ll wind up with Newportish Trails that suck or get too confusing. 
And we don’t need much to get confused.</p>

<p>The Swamp Seeker AKA <font color="#FF0000">PW </font>was last to join <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Async, Trail Hover, 
Oozing Syph, Basket</font>, and all the hounds Jake, Ben, Baxter, and Zoë. As we listened to <font color="#FF0000">Dr. 
WHO</font> explain how he was a little disappointed in the lack of rain, to feed the shiggy pits, we thought to ourselves, 
“excuses already; this run would certainly be in the shits”.</p>

<p>We had expected the trail to follow previous laid <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> trails out behind the Monastery, 
following manicured roads out where the Medieval Village once stood. Here is where the actors of the Cumberland Troupe 
would joust and make merry (men) in years past, but now it’s just abandoned fields, where occasionally our Hash fills the 
fields, with the sounds of hash music . But the <font color="#FF0000">Dr.WHO</font> had more than a little poison ivy up 
his sleeve, and after being on trail for just a few moments; we traversed a small hill and crossed behind a private back 
yard.</p>

<p>We lost <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> at the “Do Not Enter” sign, and follow out crossing the road like a flock of 
Red Cock (chickens). Why do you ask, “Did the chickens cross the road?” Well because they only had half a brain, and beer 
was on the other side, silly.</p>

<p>We followed trail down a couple streets, meandering through a quiet suburb in Cumberland, and finding a trail gate 
closed, we passed through into virgin ground. Holier than Monastery property, because there is so very little virgin 
anything left in Rhode Island, we followed flour to a check. Here the pack split up. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Trail </font>went left, <font color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> Baxter and Jake went right, and 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, on his bike, was nowhere to be found. <font color="#FF0000">Swamp Seeker</font> and 
Zoë had long since been out of sight.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was on his cell phone calling <font 
color="#FF0000">DogMeat</font>, letting her know that he had ditched the old man for a while.</p>

<p>It was more than a little humid and the hounds' tongues were hanging nearly down to the ground, Baxter and Jake’s were 
also, but didn’t complain as much as <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing.</font> Of 
course <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was following the cute behind of <font color="#FF0000">Trail</font>, complete 
with a wet T, thanks to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, and things started to really heat up. The <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> tried to call the pack together, but once <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> got his nose 
moving in one direction, it would take more than a first mate’s whistle to call him back. He was on the high ground and 
would never give that up.</p>

<p>Moments later, he was reconsidering going back to where the main pack had gone of to the left, Baxter was draggin butt 
and Jake was all but on he stomach, but persistence pays off, and after being off trail for a mile, he found flour. Hope 
springs eternal. A junkyard off to the right gave hope for a pond or at least a water crossing nearby, as the temperature 
soared in the nineties, and we all felt like Junkyard Dogs.</p>

<p>Off in the distance, a lake shimmering past a rise in the old mountain road, was sighted, but it was a mirage. Heat 
rising, waves of temperature tempting the frail and too dry<font color="#FF0000"> Basket.</font>&nbsp; <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> traveling on bike overtook the small band of forlorn and finally they all came upon a high 
rock with a Beer Check at its base.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>quickly regained his composure and climbed the rock looking for beer, while <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> sat at the bottom, playing switch. You know how to play don’t you? One thumb goes in you 
mouth and the other up you ass, then switch. Tastes like shit but can be fun to watch. Definitely a solo game, don’t ever 
try doing this with someone else.</p>

<p>Finally the late cuming FRBs arrived with the hare announcing that <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was right on 
track again, and that the beer would be found at the top. It took the devious hare to locate the beer himself, as it was 
hidden with great enterprise.</p>

<p>Soon all were drinking, singing enjoying life, and nowhere in sight were <font color="#FF0000">Swamp Seeker </font>and 
Zoë. Not that we didn’t want to see Zoë, because it’s always great to have another Bitch near, but <font 
color="#FF0000">SS PW</font> is a bit of a challenge. After complaints of no shiggy, and lots of beer consumed, the pack 
made its way down the cliff face and back towards the cars.</p>

<p>The trail was well marked from here out, quite different from the trail in, and there was a pond, where <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and Baxter cooled their steaming bodies at great length. Finally making it out to the local 
neighborhood, a lonely police car driving slowly by, watched closely at the pack. <font color="#FF0000">Trail 
Hoover</font> had missed the mark and was traveling downhill against the direction of a wet, but happy Baxter and <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, when she asked where the trail went. She said there were no marks traveling straight and 
she went right. Having enough G2 to check it out for himself, <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>found trail uphill and 
straight where the Bimbo hadn’t gone far enough. There’s a moral here, always go far enough with <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket,</font> and you may not get what you want, but you’ll get what you need.&nbsp; There’s a song 
there.</p>

<p>The merry band joined together at Gardner's and took the cooler of beer off into the woods for the Circle. Trail 
complaining of Poison Ivy, jumped on the back of macho B and was carried off into to woods. Now she’s learnin’ The circle 
was formed and the hare received his DD along with <font color="#FF0000">Biking Bitch Bondo</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> for Hashit and others too soon forgot.  <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was then given 
the Hashit for Life, because too many people have nothing better to do but vote for the least worthy. The pack then made 
their way to Friar Tuck’s for Food and Beer. Singing was a bit subdued, because it was a PG13 night, with children nearby. 
But fun was had by all, and as we High Ho’ed out for the evening, one child turned to his mother and commented, “What a 
bunch of hemorrhoids tonight at Tucks?</p>
