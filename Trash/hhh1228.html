color=#000000>Are you serious?!! An all-pavement hash. A holiday hash held at 
the usual 6:30 time. A hash originally scheduled for the far north, and then 
changed at the last minute. A mad psychiatrist as hare. All of this should have 
kept people away in droves. But for some reason, this wound up (including the 
latecummers) to be the best attended hash in recent memory. All those hashers, 
sorely disappointed. All those virgins convinced never to return. All those 
shin-splints, blisters and bunions!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

Columbus Day Parade.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>All well and 
good, but if you want the full effect, you should direct the trail against the 
flow of the parade, rather than along with it. The pack ended up seeing about 
two groups in the parade, about four times. Luckily, the hare was absent, 
“live-setting”.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> was right, but if the pack had just continued, they 
would have cut an unnecessary half-mile off the run. That is, if they could have 
found any of the non-existent marks! Trail, such as it was, crossed the Point 
Street bridge. A check sent many into a parking lot, looking for a way out. But 
true trail followed the Wild Colonial Hot Dog trail (from the day before), and 
continued up to Eddy St. and went north to the River walk. The Crawford St. 
bridge turned them back to the East Side.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Marked confusion now followed. There were almost no marks to be 
seen. Finally, by random chance, a single mark was seen on Benefit St., and the 
pack turned, found a stairway to climb, and continued north through a RISD yard, 
and on Pratt. The overgrown segment of Bowen St. was ascended, and a “B” was 
found, just inside Prospect Park. Also found was a group of 20-30 people on the 
Providence Ghost Tour. They were prepared for ghosts, but weren’t bargaining for 
hashers. The hare and the beer were found at the south edge of the 
park.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

directed them to follow trail(Ha!) back to the B of the A-to-B run. Obviously, 
this would be the Wild Colonial, so most ignored marks and simply ran downhill 
and back to Main Street. Once the hare arrived, the circle was formed, concealed 
by some underbrush on an overgrown boat-ramp. At last, some shiggy! But the 
concealment was to no avail as <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>, <FONT

pain of the pavement won out. Total:-6.9. Backsliders were next, followed by 
virgins. And, as he had convinced his girlfriend to make an appearance, <FONT 
color=#ff0000>Just Pat</FONT> (<FONT color=#ff0000>Brown-eye Taco</FONT>) was 
sent into the river for yet another renaming. We heard it from her. Don’t blame 
us. “<FONT color=#ff0000>Can’t Eat Pussy</FONT>” became his new name. Wonder how 
long that’ll last! Hashit initally went to <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT>. 
But through a bizarre sequence of whining, tortured logic, and confusion it 
wound up with the hare, for changing hash location at the last minute. 
Wanker!<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

into The Wild Colonial, where the solo barmaid/waitress/cleaning girl was 
looking pretty frazzled. Everyone ordered Reubens, as there was apparently no 
other choice. And they began to arrive after about 6.9 hours. A fine finish, and 
all declared that if they could give the hare hashit twice in one night, they 
certainly would.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
