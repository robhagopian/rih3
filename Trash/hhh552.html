<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The venue was Woonsocket and the attendance being
quite respectable at ten including Bondo and Bondo junior (hare and co-hare),
Basket, Async (returned from his posting), Rusty (Newport), Crisco Kid
(Newport), Gobble Gobble, Peter (new boots), Sajid (new boots) and of course
yours truly, Snot after missing last week because of Hewy and Ralph. (Cockney
term for sick). Peter (new boots) was attracted to our running fraternity
due to the article written in the Providence Journal on December 25 1996
by Tom Meade (alias Plume), “Harriettes” he had the nerve to call us, so
I guess Peter was alarmed to see no females last night, only full blooded
male Harriers although Sheilas are always welcome. He said the hash was
“Modeled on the old English schoolboy game of hares and hounds” well I
don’t know where you read that crap but in England this is no game based
around school kids, but a big boys and girls game who would take great
delight at shoving your plume where there is no blue ink and chasing you
around the English country side shouting ‘tally ho’ if they ever read that
article. The article was a bit vague on the facts not to mention the RIH3
web site was wrong. I think my dear Plume you owe us another article which
I would be happy to help you with some accurate info. At the very least
you should attend another run for a down down for your poor rendition.
It’s no wonder we only got one inquiry. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Back to the run where the runners were equipped
with very sexy running shorts one size fitted all (even yours truly got
them around my large backside), no expense spared with the printing still
hot off the press, a rare give away, but should be classified in the same
realm as the condom-use once, throw away. But I am sure Basket will wash
them to use again, or turn them inside out. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">With all runners fully attired the off was at
6.45pm through a nice housing estate onto an old railway line or maybe
it’s the new one the city is building-difficult to tell. Over a few roads
with drivers agog at the fashionable new shorts we were sporting. With
a few crafty checks catching out the FRB’s. The unusual part of this run
was the co-hare who would shout out “this way you dickheads” at every check,
the more experienced runners ignored this unusual behavior as the hare
is normally a lying sack of shit. This hare however was a bit wet behind
the ears and knew no better. Async and Rusty as always were out at the
front and Basket was out there somewhere carving his own trail. Eventually
the trail led us around Harris pond up to the beer stop, Basket appeared
with a video of Lassie go Home which is a pornographic depiction of the
Harriers chasing the Harriettes which Basket wants to give to the Plume.
Basket as always entered into his accent which is a mix of Scottish, Irish,
Cockney slang and Providence dribble. Never the less it was amusing as
always. Basket is the first person in America to be rejected by every living
psychiatrist which are the credentials required to run in RIH3. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The on back was a slog through forest where yours
truly was leading the pack for a while because you other silly bastards
went the wrong way and the co-hare sort of gave it away by saying “where
the f*** are they going”. A neat idea was introduced for our blind runners
(which includes all of you silly sods that missed the last check in the
woods). Bondo carried the empties in his back pack and when he wobbled
they clinked. All back except one of our new boots Sajid who incidently
got lost trying to get to one of our other runs. Maybe a handle could come
easily like ‘Lost Again’ or ‘Dickhead’. Gobble Gobble and yours truly went
out searching for this virgin with no luck but returned to find Sajit supping
a beer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Circle was formed ratings for the run given with
the exception of one (new boot) all thought the absence of shiggy was sinful,
hence nothing more than a minus three was given which was about average
for the year. Bondo junior liked the grog so much he kept his woolly hat
(which his mum had knitted him for Xmas) on for a second drink and in true
Russian style threw his mug across the garage, somebody should tell him
it works better with glass. A new handle was suggested for Bondo junior
by Douche Face who did not run on this occasion as his heart rate was beating
normal at 72BPM which could have been risky. The handle of Jovi Juice was
nominated and carried by the membership to which the recipient was duly
baptized. Before the circle broke Newport Hash awarded Basket BB a mug
which they charged him for, we can only guess it was to match the rest
of his attire, two flashlights, two bugles now two mugs. (RIH3 mugs are
now available at around $25 please submit orders to yours truly, alias
Snot.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Circle items completed we then retired to Bondo’s
home for some brilliant soup and grog-a touch more pepper in the soup next
time. The dynamic pool duo of Bondo and Snot beat everybody in sight, until
the end when Bondo deliberately missed the black to allow Basket and Rusty
their first win of the year- Rusty, you should get a partner that can shoot
straight! </FONT></P>
