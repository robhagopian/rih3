color=#000000>The start was from Dave’s Marketplace on Rt 1 in Wickford, near 
Cocumcussoc State Park. It was cool and dark, but not enough to scare away a 
virgin, brought on a date by <FONT color=#ff0000>Foaming Head</FONT>. Not 
exactly the way I’d try to impress a date, but to each his own. A visitor also 
joined, from whence <FONT color=#ff0000>WHO</FONT> doesn’t know.<?xml:namespace

color=#000000>At 6:30 with the usual promptness, they were off heading south and 
then west through swamp and thorns. A long bushwhack punctuated by the 
occasional deer trail showed the new boots why it is not exactly wise to show up 
for a <FONT color=#ff0000>WIPOS</FONT> run. There was no running involved, just 
a large amount of cursing of the hare. This actually became an aerobic exercise, 
as the effort to expel a particularly vehement “FUCK the Hare!!” uses 
intercostals, abdominals in addition to the diaphragm. Accompany this with rude 
gesticulations, and you can actually get quite a workout. But I 
digress.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

color=#000000>Finally, trail turned north and entered a neighborhood, where the 
grinning hare was first encountered. Trail led to the end of Stone Gate Drive, 
where the hare’s car was found. They re-entered the woods. It was noted that the 
hare was carrying the beer. So it didn’t take very long for the group to demand 
a beer check, especially when it was found that the hare couldn’t find his own 
trail either.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

was with them. Way to stick together. <FONT color=#ff0000>Bondo</FONT> was back 
at his car by now. <FONT color=#ff0000>Basket</FONT> was circling, but 
unfortunately, finally found the BC. All redeeming qualities of the hash were 
lost. A somber group shared the beer.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

direct route back. A few morons gave this a try, but most said “FUCK the 
Hare!!”, and went back out to the street. West on South Gate, south on Hines and 
they hit Rt 102, back to Rt 1. An additional mile maybe, pavement perhaps, but 
they still beat the bushwhackers back.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>

focussed on the lack of marks, the loss of Just Emmy (the virgin and only 
bimbo), and the visitor were counterbalanced by the loss of <FONT

FUCK the hare!! Total: -6.9. The visitor was welcomed, the virgin interrogated 
and the hashit was given to <FONT color=#ff0000>Oozing</FONT>. The hare 
suggested Ocean Mist. FUCK the hare!! Finally, they wound up at Gillians, where, 
this time at least, there was no warm IPA.<o:p></o:p></FONT></SPAN></P>
