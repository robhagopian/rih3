This was billed as the Hash that was guaranteed to get everyone wet, but with many of the regulars gone, we wondered WHO would show up. WHO was not there, as he was out on his back. Rusty had a date with his bride Anhow's Yer Bush. OOzing, Ass Quack and Crabby were listening to music at the fort. And many others were just AWOL. WIPOS, Sautee Man, Crotch Tiger, Pussy, Just Pat and Basket were joined by virgin Just Charley. As 6:30 neared, the Hare gave directions. The trail, an A to B, was going to be wet, marked in white flour, many possible water crossings and would include a floating beer stop back to A. There was no mention of using TP or some other white media, which caused a bit of confusion, but more on that later. 
The trail started out heading south before quickly crossing the Wood River, where a bushwhack soon sent us into a thin clearing of trees to a trail that took us back to the parking area on the other side of the river, from whence we started. Here we went out to Mt. Tom Rd and then westerly on Ten Rod Rd to the bridge over the Wood River. PG found flour heading northerly along the bank until it washed out in some briar/poison ivy/scrub crap. The pack was mostly together as we wondered like zombies on the hunt for flesh. PG found the trail again and it took us across the river tree more times, following what looked like TP or some kind of paper hung from branches, until we came to a Y intersection that mostly looked like the river created an island. We crossed over the island to the far right branch and not finding flour again, I bushwhacked upstream, knowing that we'd have to float downstream after the beer stop, I was pretty sure I'd be good to go. The Pack followed me like I was a Pied Piper. My thinking was solid, but unfortunately wrong. We followed the Flat River, while Just Pat found beer and the Hare following flour along the left branch on the Wood River. WHO knew there were 2 rivers? The Wood River was off trail, but we eventually made our way out to the bridge on Old Ten Rod Road and spotting the Hare's White Whale at the next bridge we ran up-road to the Beer.<br/><br/>
We were all together once again and enjoyed a beer before donning our floaties and hitting the water. The float in the cold water was difficult to say the least. It started out slowly, but as the current picked up, so did the bottom and rocks that would bruise us in some most delicate places. Unfortunately, most of us carried our floatie thingies and walked downstream. The Hare had joined us and chose, in a moment of indiscretion, allowed WIPOS to drive the White Whale and trailer back to the start. <br/><br/>
As we Circled Up, Amish brought out some wieners and Just Pat set up his grill. It was decided to eat first then complain about the trail. It wasn't long before all our faces were full and Amish hoped that would mean happy trail comments. They were mostly good, but clearly the Hare pulled a WeeBalls and did not float down to see if it was possible. Despites some complaints, he got a 6.9. Backsliders: Sautee Man and Crotchy drank. Next Virgin Just Charley drank. Next Hashit was moved from Wanker to Wanker but fell on Basket. It should have fallen on PG for telling the Virgin to not follow Basket, when clearly everyone except Just Pat followed him on the wrong river to the BS. Next came Comments, and the most important one was not about Dragon Boats, but that there will be a new Hasher in the Crotch Tiger family this January. Looking forward to and wishing our new mommy and wee one the very best.<br/><br/>
Congrats to our Crotch Tiger and here's hoping your baby is as healthy and pretty as you are. Can't wait for the newest Hasher to join our wonderful family. <br/>
Hugs & Kisses from all of us.
