<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">The stockings were all hung by the chimney
so near, </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">in hopes that St. Nicholas would fill them
with beer. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Hash was all ready and dressed for the
season, </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">With Santa and presents and things for no
reason.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was Christmas in Rhody, and the trail
had been set, </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">To find some good beer, and get some real
wet.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">From Boston and Hartford and Texas and Newport,
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">They came without care, for our seasonal
sport. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">When out in the woods, there arose such
a clamor,</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Of pheasants, and deer as they started to
scatter. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Hash was On On and the trail was so
neat </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Along rivers, and power lines, and shiggy
so deep. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">The beer would be found, no doubt, by the
clever, </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Who saw true trail, not false, a basic endeavor.
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">They ran through the woods and farm land
and pasture </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">To sniff along flour and search out the
nectar.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">At swamp land they stopped, for only a minute,
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">And sloshed along happily, just to be in
it. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">A beer check was near, and they wouldn't
slow down. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Now run up the sand pit; The beer
would be found.&quot;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Sammy's were here, all snug in a sack.
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Chilled to perfection, just waiting to crack.
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">The cold liquid felt great on the throats
parched so dry.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">From singing and running, it could just
make you cry. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">A bottle was upended, a song was begun.
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Now this was real hashing.&quot;Aren't we
having' fun?&quot; </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">The case was soon finished, back on to the
trail, </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Now look alive! The On On was waiting for
us to arrive.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">On Fat One and Dribbles and Hung Like a
Mouse.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">On Rusty and Mouth Full and Duck Lips you
louse. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">On Bondo and Necker and Crew Doo and Jake.
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">On Swamp Thang and Prissy; your still such
a snake. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Some ran like the wind, SEO - he works out.
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Others dragging their asses; their bellies
so stout. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">We all made it in, to the end, just the
same. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">For beer and for food, for it's this that
we came. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">A circle was formed; ice brought for a seat.
</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">To the hare give a Down Down, he did plan
this feat. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">All visitors and virgins received their
just do, </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Scotch Ale, Cream Stout, Honey Porter, to
name just a few. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Inside there was food, more beer and some
singing. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">To warm by the fire, and complain of thorns
stinging. </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">To talk to old friends for just a short
while, </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">This holiday season would be gone in quick
style.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">To enjoy comforts of home, and hang up shiggy
shoe </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Where hashers do mingle, and throw back
just a few.</FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">One thought I do leave on this holiday so
dear, </FONT></ADDRESS>

<ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year.
