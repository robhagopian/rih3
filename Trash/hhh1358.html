The Prelude: <br>
Dog Meat had a hip surgery scheduled at 6AM Monday morning. So I dropped her off at Brigham and Womens in Foxboro bright and early that morning. It had me at work early and give me some time to catch up on some work before the team arrives. She was due out by noon and I should have time to drop her off at home, get back to work and finish up in time to get to the Hash by 6:30 for a change. All was on schedule just as DM called and asked me to pick up some drugs on the way home, then maybe get her some soup and fluff up a pillow or two. It was 5:30 by the time I finally got to lock up the shop, almost 6 by the time I arrived home, and it was almost 6:20 by the time I was back out the door. I'd be late again.<br><br>

The Run:<br>
Traffic was not bad and I arrived at the start just 20 minutes late. As I dropped my trou and hoisted me kilt, Pat My Retard happened by and asked if I always get naked in parking lots. WIPOS was straight across the river, blowing his horn and PMR asked if there was a shorter way over, as she got lost at the start and decided to make her way back to the lot and start over. "Can you swim", I asked. I guess she didn't like the question because by the time I had my sneakers tied, she was nowwhere to be found.<br><br>

I started out from the parking lot about 6:55, and crossed the river hoping to catch the pack at the beer stop. I could see WIPOS making his way up the hill towards the houses on Hund Street in Seekonk, Ma. I called for PMR, but no answer, so I continued on until I caught up with him as he was just entering the woods along the river at the end of Nye Street.<br><br>

The trail was well marked, as it meandered along with the river over brush, trash and thickets along the flood zone. We skipped over a few mud flats but, for the most part, I was disappointed that the Hare did not lay flour on either side of the river. That could have been a great shiggy trail. Instead my feet were mostly clean and just damp from skipping on the rocks at the start.<br><br>

Trail led out to a ball field at the Agawam-Flynn Playground, and a falsie caused me to continue around the field looking for flour. I nodding to a officer in a squad car, who was watching me, as I made my way in a circle back to the check. I ran into WIPOS and we both searched for flour. Eventually we found trail leading back to the river, and soon I could hear the jeering from the Wankers at the beer stop, on the opposite side of the river, on top of a high rock overlook. <br><br>

The river was a bit deeper here and it would now have to be crossed without the aid of rocks to skip upon, I hoisted my kilt and found myself ball deep. The Wankers were proding me to go this way or that, with the expectation that I'd find the deepest hole, but I waded across with nothing more than a damp crotch. The water felt good on the legs where briars had removed the usual amount of the flesh. <br><br>

The Beer Stop:<br>
Beer was offered with a selection of snacks as we watched WIPOS search for an shallow crossing. He worked his way along the opposite bank heading upstream and would not be seen again for almost 20 minutes. Oozing suggested we move the beer to the other side of the river so WIPOS's effort to stay dry was in vain, but Amish, Pubic and I decided we would work our way back to the cars. The trail could not have been more that 1 1/2 miles, so we were back at the cars well before dark.<br><br>

The CirclE:<br>
Eventually all made it back, including WIPOS WHO found a way around the water feature. No sign of PMR, but being smarter then the rest of us, we guessed she went home. The Hare received his just reward, as did Rusty for missing 3 runs with a poor excuse of being in Ireland. When the discussion turned towards Hashit, I was pretty sure WIPOS would have worn the sack for his pathetic attempt, albiet successful, of keeping his feet dry. As it often happens, it doesn't take much to cum up with some stupid reason to give it to me, and so it was.<br><br>

The OnOnOn:
We traveled to Not Your Average Joe's for Pizza and a well deserved beer. Just as we settled down for dinner, Pat My Retard popped in. How she knew where we were and where she'd been for the last 2 hours is anybody guess, but it was nice to see here just the same. When the food and beer was gone, we all made our way home, early and content despite no cupcakes.<br><br>
