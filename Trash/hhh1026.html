<p><font color="#008000">Run #1026</font>, November 28, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Co-Hare:</font>&nbsp; Amazon-dot-cum</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; The Monastery, Cumberland</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 40’s, partly cloudy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Great at Giving Head, Dr WHO, Oozing SD, SESYB, Basket Boom Boom, Dick Doc 
(TBGH), Bondo Jovi, WIPOS, Amish It Head, Seamus, Ben.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The directions specified to drive into the Monastery and turn right to park under “the tree”. There being more than one 
tree, this resulted in considerable dispersion of the hash right from the beginning. For all we know, <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Sandra</font> may still be there sitting in her car, waiting for someone to show up at her tree. But 
the co-hare (and visitor) <font color="#FF0000">Amazon-dot-cum</font> heard the sound of beer bottles opening as <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> wheedled one off <font color="#FF0000">Great at Giving Head</font> in a dark corner of the 
lot. She came over and collected them and then the rest, as they straggled in. Promptly at 6:30, they were off, the hare 
somewhere in the wilds, preparing trail. Or drinking. To excess.</p>

<p>The group followed an arrow, directing them northwest and then west on the perimeter road. A falsie snagged <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>. But having set trail here before has its advantages. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> pressed on and they continued southwest on a lovely path paralleling the true trail. Led 
by <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, the pack had crossed through the fence, and were contending with checks, 
underbrush and the like. Only <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> had the sense to stick with <font 
color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>. The rest followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. 
For Shame!</p>

<p>The short cutters came on to true trail. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led, as the trail joined the cross-country 
path and turned more west. An arrow indicated that trail should cross the Monastery Brook. The suggestion was politely 
declined by all. Except the co-hare. Trickery? Loyalty? Stupidity? You be the judge. Continuing straight, marks soon were 
found re-joining the trail. At the next check, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> took true trail to the left. <font 
color="#FF0000">WHO</font> went right and uphill off trail, heading straight for the quarry cliffs. There was a circle 
jerk that the pack enjoyed, and a small bushwhack that <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> enjoyed. But soon <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and the pack came together as they approached the cliffs. 
A “W” check was marked, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> came out to the second ledge where he found a bottle of 
Maker’s Mark (Hooray!) and the hare (Boo!). He was drinking. To excess.</p>

<p>The whiskey was broached as they took stock. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>? Slowed by his aching knee (cadaveric 
ligament: guaranteed good for ten years or 100 hashes, whichever comes first), he was still on, but considerably behind. 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>? Ha! By this time he was looking for flour at the opposite end of the woods, at the 
memorial called “Nine Men’s Misery”. (A good name for a <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> trail, come to think of it.) 
The group sang a few songs, and flicked their headlights off and on to tease the hare. The hare was worried about someone 
seeing the lights, and was behaving like a little girl. (Or to use his own words: a “f**kin’ Sally!”) The whiskey level 
dropped. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> arrived. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> tripped over a wire fence. No 
blood loss this time. The co-hare took off to set the trail.</p>

<p>After ten minutes they resumed. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> led straight east, bushwhacking along the clearly 
marked trail. This time, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> was right as he turned northwest on the trail and led as they 
avoided a second cute girlish circle jerk and turned north. But true to form, he soon was foundering and at the next 
check, <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> took the lead. They came to a strange 
mark: two adjacent circles with central dots. Luckily, the more experienced hashers arrived. They explained the venerable 
and sacred “Tit Check” concept. It was further pointed out that a nipple was not, in fact, a teat, and therefore <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font> taking his shirt off would not qualify. Now here’s the one Boston tradition we could do more 
of! But when <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> arrived, they weren’t 
enthusiastic. (<font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> does claim that she flashed a nearby squirrel while the lights were 
off her. It had to do. Although we’ll never know.)</p>

<p>A falsie at this check led <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> back out to the cliffs. But there was another wire 
fence. A cautious <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> crossed it so slowly that he alone noticed the false mark on the far 
side. They all reversed to follow east on trail behind <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dick 
Doc</font>. A brief jog on the trail slightly downhill, led to the school cross-country trail, where white painted arrows 
and marks confused the pack for a while. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> is not one to pay any attention to any marks, 
real or imagined. And fortune favoring the handicapped yet again, he found trail north.</p>

<p>Fortune can only go so far. They came to an arrow directing them across the field. On the far side, no marks were seen 
and they milled about like a herd of mad cows. The hare finally called them into the woods and across Monastery Brook. The 
cohare was waiting. It was the Beer Check. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was still missing. All that was needed (and 
missing, unfortunately) was a piece of wire for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> to trip over. Beer was opened and 
songs begun. The hare resumed drinking. To excess. But drawn by the noise and fresh from “Nine Men’s Misery” came <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. The BC became “Eight Men’s, Three Women’s and Two Dogs’ Misery”. The rest began to drink. To 
excess.</p>

<p>Trail out led south. Most cooperated and stayed on trail. With the cohare. And <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>. And 
<font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font>. Could be significant. But <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> ignored the trail. 
The lights from the library were clearly visible, and both <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">G@GH</font> had beer in their vehicles. The perennial choice: beer vs bimbos. One must live with one’s own 
decision. This is the hard and thorny reality of hashing. They came out to the cars. They shared some beer, and waited.</p>

<p>The hare finally arrived and told them that the circle was back on the trail. They hopped into his truck, and he drove 
(while drinking. To excess.) them back to where the rest waited, just inside the bushes at the edge of the road. The 
circle was formed. Ratings for the run included the fact that this was virgin territory (NOT), had minimal pavement, a 
whiskey stop and three bimbos. But, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> made it to the BC, there was minimal shiggy, and no 
one was arrested. Total <b>+0.69</b>. Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, because yet again he was 
just begging for it. Tripping over wire never grows old.</p>

<p>The circle finished, they convoyed off to Tuck’s, all present except <font color="#FF0000">Dick Doc</font> who was 
either lost, or too smart to spend any more time with the hare. The effects of whiskey and beer proved more than a match 
for his half-mind. He became loud. He became profane. He stopped drinking. Too late. He became obnoxious. Nothing new, 
here. But word is, the next morning he was found naked and drooling on some clean laundry in a strange man’s bed somewhere 
in Cambridge. Could just be a rumor. But I don’t make this stuff up.</p>
