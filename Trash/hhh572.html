<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The RIH3 mystery run on a dark and dull, potentially
thunderous evening. The Hare, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
had arranged for all to meet at his abode from whence transportation would
be provided to the mystery start point. Unfortunately for me I got to the
pick up point at 6:40 &amp; they had left at 6:36 (bastards). On enquiring
of Mrs.Jovi, she provided me with sufficient intel to locate the pack.
So, swiftly dashing to Fogarty Mem. I found </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo's</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
van at the arse end of the lot. I ran around like a fucking headless chicken
trying to find trail, to no avail. I later found out that I had found the
end of the trail. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I ran to the highway and found those infamous
RIH3 trailmarkers.......the powerline....a short distance later I saw the
pack atop a rocky ledge singing and wanking like any good pack does. On
attracting their attention I was showered with abuse, golden and not so
golden. The shiggy was waste deep swiftly followed by ankle deep stuff
that sucked my sneeker off as fast as a $100 bill going into a whores wallet.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> told me
to move faster as the beer was running out, sure enough when I looked up
I saw the beer running out of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
Upon guidance from </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
I moved to the other cliff face, this was a setup as he had just pissed
where I had my hand!!!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little Neck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> started
a song about Lepers and the pack joined in, we sang some more and fired
Ice Cubes at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Baskets</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
forehead to try and remove the mosquito that was sucking his brains out.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> forced
more beer on us and time came to pass as it usually does on a Monday night,
so much so that it became time to run again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The hare enlightened us as to the direction we
should take and then he and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little Neck</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
promptly fucked off t'other way. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">remained
at the front of the pack whilst </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
veered off to check out the bushes. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ooozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Gobble Gobble</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
headed towards </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
who by now resembled a dog haunched in a field, he whinned about the size
of the available shrubbery and continued the run with his legs spread.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We finally hit the shiggy on an old train line
and this led us to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bondo</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">'s
van where the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Little Necker </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">was
awaiting our arrival. A quick ride to chez Bondo saw the fun and frolicks
continue. Bickering about the RA for the evening brought shouts of &quot;Bring
in the Snot&quot;, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
of course, took this literally!!! The Hashit went to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">OOOozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
the Hare was congratulated for setting such a pathetic run and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Gobble</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
almost swallowed with his hat on. Swing Low was a classic version which
the Vienna Old Farts Choir would have been proud of. Cigars were lit and
the conversation continued into the night. </FONT></P>
