<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>In 1066, William the Conqueror invaded England and defeated and disheartened the Saxons and Harold at the battle of 
Hastings. In run #1066, <font color="#FF0000">William the Wanker</font> (aka <font color="#FF0000">Enema Bill- LAM</font>, 
or <font color="#FF0000">Basket Boom Boom</font>) invaded Burrillville and defeated and disheartened the RIH3 and visitors 
whose only goal was to celebrate Labor Day with a nice hash, and maybe some beer. The parallels are inevitable. (And 
irrelevant. But they certainly can stretch the write-up.) The location selected for this debacle was the single most 
overused hash spot in North America: the Burrillville Middle School. Even the satellite photos of this area on Google 
Earth and TerraServer, when carefully examined show cars with just discernable “On-On” stickers from 1996 and 2004 
snapshots. Even the virgin visitor <font color="#FF0000">Just Liam</font>, who had never before heard of hashing, 
mentioned that he had heard a couple of drunks complaining about the “…bloody Burrillville Middle School, hoots!” at a bar 
in Dundee last summer. Even I digress.</p>

<p>Rather than describe the run in detail, I would refer the reader to other, more interesting write-ups from the past. 
Let’s begin. Now <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> has never been much of a hare. But he was a scribe, and his style 
combines a fine degree of whining, with an accurate picture of his incompetence as a runner. In run <a href="hhh548.html">
#548</a>, Dec 1996 we have a fine example of his style, as well as a mirror image of this run. But what’s this? In May of 
’97, <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> tried again, in run <a href="hhh573.html">#573</a>. Not much different there, 
apart from the weather. But this one was a holiday, another recurring theme. Skipping over the 6th and 14th of July, 1997 
(at least one of those must have been at BMS), we find that <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> got creative for Labor Day 
that year: Slatersville Fishing Ramp, Burrillville. Good for him!</p>

<p>Skipping ahead a bit past the gaps in the Hash Trash, we next move to St Patrick’s Day 2001, and run <a 
href="hhh775.html">#775</a>. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was scribe, and had not yet come to the peak of verbal 
diarrhea which has so afflicted him of late. This run was an A to B variant, commonly used when the hare was feeling 
exceptionally lazy. And then: July 4, 2001, run <a href="hhh791.html">#791</a>. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, in 
his Blue period, was scribe. With brevity and yet with incomprehensibility, he describes a classic BMS run: North along 
the river, crossing the river, west and south crossing the river, etc. Time has not changed Burrillville “the place to be 
in the 21st century!” But what’s next? A seminal event, the <a href="hhh800.html">800th</a> run, Sept 3, 2001. Scribed by 
<font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, this write-up is singled out for its incomprehensibility and unnecessary length. Of 
course, the run represents another variation: a classic BMS run in reverse (clockwise) starting from Bella’s Restaurant to 
fool the RIH3. By all accounts, it worked. It certainly fooled the scribe!</p>

<p>Now our hare took a blissful hiatus from the BMS. He instead focused on the BHS. And the Slatersville Fishing Ramp. Not 
much better, but beyond the scope of this dissertation. So it is not until May, 2004 that we first encounter something 
new: the dreaded Burrillville Hat Trick! Runs <a href="hhh944.html">#944</a>, <a href="hhh945.html">945</a> and <a 
href="hhh946.html">946</a>, ALL in Burrillville and two (virtually identical) in a row at the BMS! Personally, I cannot 
even bring myself to reread and possibly re-experience this trauma. Try it if you dare! But why not just skip ahead. 
Memorial Day, 2005. The <a href="hhh999.html">999th</a> run of the RIH3. Where would you have it? Why not the 
BMS. This run was scribed by <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot Fairy</font>, the older scribes having run out of diplomatic 
things to say about these affairs. At least there are pictures.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re as bored by all this as I am. So I’ll briefly describe the actual run. (Mathematically, it was <a 
href="hhh548.html">#548</a> +(<a href="hhh945.html">#945</a>+<a href="hhh946.html">#946</a>)/2 * <a href="hhh791.html">
791</a>/<a href="hhh999.html">999</a>. To the third power.) In plain English (much like that used by Harold and the Saxons 
in 1066, when they said: “Fock ye Normans!”), the trail began as a simple counterclockwise loop, along the inner path next 
to the river heading north. Some falsies led across, but few were fooled. They turned west then south. Finally, the 
inevitable. They crossed the river. They went into some shiggy, and ultimately came out to a corn field, which they 
followed south briefly on its outskirts.( I believe there were several corn fields at Hastings. My people call it maize.) 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> slowed to eat some corn. Shine On also took a few ears, for purpose uncertain. The 
time came to cross the river again. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> led across, and successfully diverted most of the 
pack by feinting back from true trail, claiming to have found a false mark.</p>

<p>They continued south on paths and into some shiggy. It wasn’t much, but it was sufficient for <font color="#FF0000">Wee 
Willie Wankie</font> to get a Wee Sprainy Ankly.  (The Normans had problems with many sprained ankles as they landed on 
the rocky Channel shores. Too bad the Chunnel wouldn’t be built for another 935 years.) The trail came out onto the 
mini-tracks of the railroad at Mr. Doughboys. They disrupted some mini-golfers, and spilled out onto the Bronco 
mini-Highway. (As far as I know, there were NO mini-golfers in the south of England in 1066. I believe golf itself was yet 
to be invented; this would occur several hundred years later, when the Scots became restive during a plague which killed 
most of the sheep in Scotland.) Led by the exasperated <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and the energetic <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Liam</font>, they passed Bella’s, and turned left to find the BC at a power switching station just 
east of the restaurant parking lot.</p>

<p>The beer was easily found, and although a mixture of old bottled beers rather than the usual Trinity brew, the beer was 
enjoyed. (William the Conqueror was especially fond of ale.) Especially as <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> were missing. But even those two couldn’t be fooled forever, especially not in 
Burrillville. All present, the hare sent them off, claiming a Turkey-Eagle Split. This was found shortly east up the road. 
The Turkeys continued straight, while the Eagles did a short but meaningless counterclockwise loop down Walling Road, then 
back to Victory Highway, across some landowners’ yards, and north to the old RR grade parallel to the Bronco Highway. 
Never done that, before! The leaders blew away the hare, who had planned to stage the second BC in the junkyard. Forget 
it! The end was in sight.</p>

<p>They regrouped as usual in the back yard at 290 Snake Hill. The run was rated, and the hare sat on a bag of ice cubes. 
Pathetic! It was only the lack of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, a sprained ankle, and many bimbos that prevented a 
total rout. Total:  <b>+0.69</b>. The visitors and backsliders were then punished. The young Scots virgin was brought into 
the circle and onto the ice, causing a flutter of bimbos to one side of the circle to have a look at his assets. (Harold 
himself after his loss at Hastings was forced to sit on some ice before being hung, drawn and quartered. Too bad that 
never happens when <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> drops his drawers!) Finally, the ceremony ended, and they proceeded 
to a fine feast, with the brave (or more drunk) proceeding into the arctic pool to clean off. Another holiday, another 
Monday and another six hours wasted.</p>
