missing the hash and so sent me this in the way of a write-up after I described
the run to him and wondered if you,O great WebMeister, would accept this not so
subtle in the way of a regret as the official write-up(I don't mind) -- Oozing</i><br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Run:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, let me start off by saying that altho' not
present at the hash, I feel compelled to write it up after <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
described the run to me in our weekly session,er...I mean weekly chat. &nbsp;
You see, I thought I was the master bike hasher, but in reality I'm just a
verbal master-bater (barely that too at this age, mind you). For you see this
run was a classic.&nbsp; How do I know? Well, I wasn't going to simply take <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>&nbsp;
(that good for bleep-nuthin Iranian terrorist) [Ed. Note: Evidence of genuine <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
verbal merchandise] for his word, no, I put him thru the Jake truth test and the
faithful ex-GM did not say woof once as Oozing recounted his run. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">No, it was nuthin' like my sorry excuse of a bike
run a few weeks back( that deterred <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Shine
On</font> from cumming to this run), for <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> had
them pedal thru 5-6 miles upwards of prime-mountain bike territory i.e., plenty
of rocks, bumps, mud and obstacles in the way of roots and rocks, not to mention
the perfectly poised checks that had all hashers hit falsies until <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>,
frustrated, left trail and managed to use his well-honed sniffing skills to make
it to the BC. Oh, yes, there was BEER on this run albeit shitty dutch horse-piss
but tasty limey-piss at the circle, which just about made up for the former. And
for once, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> attempting to short cut got the
better of him, and swallowing hard on his pride, had to retract and follow the
well-marked trail. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So well marked, that <font color="#FF0000">Mother
Goose</font>, returning years later and a good 30 minutes late made it just
before the end of the circle and drank her well-deserved down-down. Also doing
the honours was the hare and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, who keeps the
sorry bleep excuse of a hashit he dragged to the run! The only comment worth
recording is mine and since ya all didn't hear it well...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot; This bleep run bleep sucked! Too bleep
long, too bleep much like a real bleep mountain bike run and too many bleep
falls my bleep arse hurt altho that for some bleep reason it feels bleep good
and feeling the bleep seat ram into my bum, ohhhh....er, and the beer really
bleep sucked and bleep,bleep,bleep,bleep.....&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Given my sorry excuse for not cumming (golfing
with workmates...yes, I, not <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, am the true
yuppie!) I now relinquish my RA duties for I truly am not worthy...my dogs bark
in agreement. Sounds like a good time was had by all and I wish....</font></p>

next run!) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">P.S: I object to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
classifying golf as a sissy game...I mean, what's your point?<br>
