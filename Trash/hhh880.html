<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Anxious to conserve his precious supply of beer, the 
hare set trail from the identical starting point of the previous week’s glorious 
outing hared by <font color="#FF0000">Swallows My Pride</font>. (Last weeks hash 
was so wonderful he reasoned, that people would be bound to say: “Why show up, 
and ruin my memories of that near perfect hash? What could <font color="#FF0000">
WIPOS </font>be thinking? Is <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> actually capable 
of thinking? I’m gonna stay home and watch some “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” 
reruns with a liter of porter and a jar of pickled eggs!”) As it happened, he 
was right. Only the few stalwarts (imbeciles) showed up at the appointed hour. 
The hare gave instructions to follow paper squares bearing the likeness of the 
notorious Bin Laden. The search was on.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> started off 
early, while the rest waited for the clock to show 6:30. He went down into the 
ice-covered playing fields. This enabled him to get lost, kick his dog, swear 
profusely, spill his beer, and fall on the ice three times before anyone else 
had left the parking lot. He struggled up the hill to rejoin the hare as
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi, Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO
</font>led on trail, south on Pleasant Street. The marks from last week’s first 
falsie provoked some sighs of wistful nostalgia. At the first check,
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> went 
straight, over the wall and into Swan Point Cemetery. <font color="#FF0000">Who
</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went west on Alfred Drown. They 
obviously missed the point. Consider that entering Swan Point would not only be 
trespassing, but would also be an act of sacrilegious desecration as well as 
international terrorism. How could the hare resist? They re-gathered in the 
trails of the woods of the cemetery.</p>

<p>The combination of numerous falsies, obscene photos 
of Usama Bin Laden stapled to trees, and treacherous ice and snow underfoot had 
the hashers thinking that this trail might be OK after all. But far too quickly, 
a check at the main entrance led out of the woods, across Blackstone Boulevard 
and onto Elmgrove. They headed south. And further south. And further south. The 
markings were few. [Still, they were probably enough to cause some consternation 
the next morning as the residents of this mostly Jewish Neighborhood awakened to 
find the grinning face of the world’s most wanted terrorist smirking at them 
from their telephone poles as they collected their morning paper. But I 
digress.] Finally a check was followed onto Upton heading east.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> continued 
straight towards the beer check, while the rest followed the hare’s advice and 
took off to the right after a few blocks. South, again! <font color="#FF0000">
WHO</font> crossed the boulevard but turned around, giving up less than 25 yards 
from a mark that would have led him straight back to the beer. What an idiot! 
Everyone knew that the beer would be in one of three places: Blackstone Park, 
the Railroad bridge, or at the home of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing Bin Laden</font> 
on Benefit Street. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> was starting to favor the 
idea that <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>was waiting with the beer at home, 
warm and comfy in his false beard, laughing at the idea of the hashers’ 
discomfiture. But as he headed back up to the boulevard, he saw the full-figured 
form of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> passing reluctantly by the doors of 
the all-girls Lincoln School. He was heading south. On Butler Ave.</p>

<p>The group was together again. They easily dispatched 
a check, recognizing finally that the beer must be in these well-known 
homosexual meeting areas. Crossing through the playgrounds at Patterson Park, 
they entered the woods. The brief thaw a few days before followed by some frigid 
nights had led to near completely smooth ice covering all passable trails. They 
slid down to Blackstone Pond. They fell. They scrambled up an ice wall moving 
north at last. They fell. The hare lost his own trail. He fell. Things were 
certainly looking up. Below the Lincoln School they came to a drainage ditch 
with a few inches of moving water, and a log to cross. <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi, WHO,</font> and the hare crossed easily, with only minor groin injuries 
from a knot in the middle of the log. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> took 
Seamus, and looked for an alternate route. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
looked. He swore profusely. He farted. He fell. Finally, he climbed down into 
the stream. He then entered a prolonged and quite comical struggle trying to 
grab his dogs and force them across. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> looked on. They did not offer help. Except 
for gratuitous advice.</p>

<p>Back up hill they ran. They were joined by
<font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>on Irving Ave, and continued north in the 
woods along the top of a steep bluff to a small opening in the woods about 50 
feet straight up above Gulf Ave and the riverbanks. The beer was found. Finally, 
the hare came through. Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout! [There is in fact a reason why 
this group hashes week after week.] As they had their first beer, the hare 
remarked that the gay population of Providence had been forced from the street 
below into the woods and streets above the water. This was because the police 
had taken to patrolling the riverbanks quite aggressively.&nbsp; They often, in fact, 
stationed a patrol car right below the beer check. A patrol car arrived as he 
spoke. It stopped just below the beer check. I mean, RIGHT below! (The drool 
from Seamus’s jowls would have fallen on the cop’s windshield if it hadn’t been 
frozen solid.) The dogs started to bark. They were fed some Oatmeal Stout to 
shut them up. O, the senseless waste!</p>

<p>Finally, the beer was finished. Trail led back out 
to Grotto, and was promptly ignored as the hashers made their ways back to the 
cars in small groups. A dull, cold and uneventful two miles later, they gathered 
at the cars and circled up. Rating the run proved somewhat challenging. It was 
ultimately decided that the choice of beer and the sight of
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> in a sewage overflow ditch struggling with a 
frantic Labrador retriever evenly matched the poor markings and excessive length 
of pavement. The ice fields and the picture of Usama Bin Laden emerging from 
someone’s rectum (posted on hallowed ground) pushed the run firmly to a +0.69. 
Singing was subdued, mostly because the temperature was approaching single 
digits. [Actually, last week it had been equally cold. But then, their singing 
had prompted a resident across both a soccer field and a baseball field to shout 
“Shut Up, you a**holes!” The singing had also incidentally caused a cerebellar 
stroke, two small heart attacks and a mini-epidemic of fecal incontinence on the 
third floor of the adjacent Oak Hill Nursing Home. But I digress.] Hashit was 
probably given to someone. Since your scribe cannot recall, he will firmly 
maintain that it was given to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> as usual.</p>

<p>On on on was back at the East Ave Café. This was 
particularly enjoyable at first because the hare got lost again, and went to the 
wrong bar. [He went down the block to a Portuguese Fish Place which only serves 
Bud Light and Pabst. He narrowly escaped molestation at the hands of a couple of 
60 year-old Portuguese fishermen who had seen him earlier in the day hanging 
around a gay park near the river. But I digress.] The young lady who was so 
impressed by <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi’s</font> performances as “Dickhead” and “Rubber” (see pictures for last 
weeks write-up) showed up again, equally drunk. But when it became clear that no 
prophylactic inflation was to be performed, she lost interest. They tried to 
keep the price down for <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, who was still 
smarting from the $20.00 tab the week before. It was kept down all the way to 
$18. Of course the management has started charging for malt vinegar use whenever 
they see this bunch, so that increases the cost somewhat. The evening ended 
well, and all went home looking forward to the thaw and the muds of spring to 
come.</p>
