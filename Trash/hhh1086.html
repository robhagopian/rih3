<p>Setting trail in another’s back yard for the second week in a row? This could be a trend. Maybe my next trail will 
start from Larch Street, in Providence. The hare must have known the abuse he would take for this, but did it anyways. At 
least he had a light ongoing snowfall to help his efforts: the snow started at 6 PM, soon after he had finished laying the 
trail.</p>

<p>Off they went east on the powerlines, led by <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
who knew there were only so many ways you could go from here. Naturally, at the check after the powerlines turned 
northeast, they continued east through the wildlife tunnel under 24, and were not heard of for some time. The rest were 
led by the hare northwest over a breach in the wire fence, and into the quarries.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> followed trail not yet obscured by 
snow. They crossed into an overgrown field and bushwhacked for a while, heading north. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
took one look and headed back to the powerlines. He soon caught up with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> on Eagleville 
Road. They found a mark under about a quarter inch of snow and continued under 24 to reenter the woods on the second half 
(the shiggy half!) of the trail. They were not seen again.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had caught up with the “pack” of the hare, <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>. They crossed Eagleville on the gas pipeline and quickly found a bushwhack east to the 
powerlines and the BC. Beer was brought out and they kept very quiet for fear of attracting <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> or <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Finally, they moved on.</p>

<p>The hare led them back on the powerlines to Eagleville Rd. The mark that had sent <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> off was long covered. The hare tried to get the pack to follow it, but once the BC 
is over, it takes a lot of convincing to get anyone to avoid the straight and obvious return path for the unknown. So they 
jogged back on the powerlines. The circle was prepared and as they were bringing a cooler out of the hare’s car, they saw 
a light coming from the south on Fish Road. It was the lost boys. Just when the marks were going to be good!</p>

<p>The run was rated: Snow, obscured marks, temporary loss of Basket and Bondo were strong arguments. But the lack of 
virgin territory, the ONLY TEMPORARY loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, 
and the absence of bimbos was enough to result in a <b>+0.069</b>. Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>. Or 
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Or both. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could care less. The On On On was back at 
Li’l Bear. And that’s all I can recall.</p>
