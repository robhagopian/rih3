<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>There was lots of snow. It was cold. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> was hare. The directions sucked. The trail 
sucked. The marks sucked. The beer sucked. The run sucked. The directions REALLY sucked! Big surprise. Let us illustrate:

You'd have to get inside Fuwangi's half mind to figure out those misdirections, and frankly, let's not go there.<br>

<blockquote><p>You weren’t the only one mislead by the directions. Evidently <font color="#FF0000">Cumunder</font> made 
an attempt to join us too and actually found the parking lot. However, without marks leading out toward trail, she decided 
to forgo waiting for us and made her way home.<br><br>
 
The two of you were the lucky ones; the rest of us had to follow another sad attempt at a <font color="#FF0000">Boner
</font> trail.<br><br>
 
Evidently he thought this an opportunity to stick it to us on the straight and narrow bike path, for way to many miles. 
The only high points of the evening were <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> bailing out with a booboo on his foot, poor 
baby, and two 19 year olds, beautiful babies.<br><br>
 
They were cute, naive and rather stupid to pick us up, and drive the smart ones back to the start. The fact that 6 of us, 
along with Seamus and the two girls fit into that Ford Focus says more about the bad trail than anything.<br><br>
 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and the Hare thought a continuation of the agony 
of the trail, in reverse, was better than running down the street, where we found the lucky ride. Lucky for them, there 
was beer left at the circle when they finally returned.<br><br>
 
We were out 4 hours and found the kitchen closed at the first choice for the après, but managed to confuse a few patrons 
at Chile’s at our last resort. We arrived just minutes before they closed, so we didn’t have to boil the hare for 
sustenance. In hindsight, that might not have been a bad idea, the boiling not the eating.<br><br>

<p>If only there’d been a few more emails, this write-up could have been avoided!</p>

<p>The hare sent the hash out from the Stop and Shop parking lot, SOUTH of 295 on Mendon Road. He had used this spot for 
his hash of one year (less a week and a day ago - <a href="hhh985">#985</a>). (That one was an abortion also!) Trail was 
negotiated by the hare, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> using skis in the 10” of fresh snow. <font color="#FF0000">Amazon
</font> opted for snowshoes. <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and the Boston men went with running shoes. <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, arriving late, stayed in his car. Oh aged and wise one, we worship you!</p>

<p>The hare led south through the parking lot. They reversed direction on the bike path before the bridge, and turned 
northwest in snow. At least one mark was seen. Crossing the river on a bridge with a double check, <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> found true trail reversing again between the canal 
and the river south. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> continued northwest.</p>

<p>The trail soon came out on pavement. It went out past the parking lot for the bike path, onto Rt 123. Turning left, the 
Boston runners led to a “SC”, next to the John Street Bridge. The hare led under the bridge and broke out PEPPERMINT 
SCHNAPPS!?? (The “S” actually stands for SHITE!) Naturally, this check didn’t last long. But the hare was live-setting 
from this point. So, the group whiled away a few minutes with a few songs. (Nothing like those under bridge acoustics.) 
Then back out they went, north on the driveway to the abandoned drive-in theater.</p>

<p>They came back onto Mendon road. They crossed the bridge and were back at the Stop and Shop. After some confused 
milling about and near-traffic-accidents, a light tan colored arrow was found, directing them back onto the bike path. 
They were repeating the first part of the trail! What a wank! On they went, strapping the skis back on, and crossing the 
bridge they followed now in <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS’</font> footsteps. The 
trail became a trek. Fighting the winds and snow drifts, no marks to speak of, but no options for checks, this was 
becoming an athletic event. Or even more apt, a fight for survival against the elements with only a few sips of 
nauseatingly sweet rotgut gurgling uneasily in the stomach to sustain them. At least 2.5 miles of straight, snow-covered 
pavement, and to make it even worse, they encountered first <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, then <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and finally the hare!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> having been overtaken, decided that no beer from this hare could be worth it. He 
whined about blisters on his heels, and reversed direction. The rest struggled on. They passed the Martin Street Bridge. 
They continued northwest. Finally, they came to the 116 Bridge. The hare declared it the BC. But there was no beer. He 
went off up the embankment to get the brew. The group sat on a wooden railing at the parking area by Littleneck’s old 
house. They knew the hare must have a second car stashed up there somewhere. There must be a ride back. Whew!</p>

<p>The hare brought down the beer. They replenished. No one had much energy for singing. Then, a bombshell! The hare 
expected everyone to run/ski back on the bike path. Unbelievable! Unacceptable! Only <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> turned back to catch <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> with the hare. The rest 
decided to try their luck on Mendon Road. They crossed the footbridge, and in the parking lot of the converted factory, 
ran into the two saintly teens described by <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> email above. There IS a God. And he’s 
laughing at <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>!</p>

<p>Back at the cars, the group found <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. They drove to the parking lot off 123 where the 
hare had planned to meet for the circle. They easily found the beer. All of them kept warm in <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo’s</font> van, with beer and a progressively more naked <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> offering 
the Bostonians aromatic samplings of his intimate anatomy. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> went out to let the hare, 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> know to join the circle. And the circle was 
finally formed.</p>

<p>Ratings mentioned the extreme length (both distance and time: more than 5 miles for most, more like 7 for <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, and 3 hours!), the poor markings, the repetitive 
loop, etc. Only the snow, the loss of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> just before the BC, and the Ford (some kind of 
mini-SUV, not a Focus. Maybe <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> meant “F**K Us”.) allowed the hare to escape with a 
<b>-6.9</b>! Hashit: any guesses? <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, of course. The visitors were abused, as if they had 
not suffered enough. The circle was concluded. They drove off to Tucks. It was closed. A crowning touch! They ended up in 
the Chili’s at the Lincoln Mall. Arriving home well after midnight, most of them asked themselves why, oh why do we keep 
doing this? No answers forthcoming, they drifted off into fitful sleep. And memory playing the usual hash tricks, all was 
forgotten the next day.</p>
