Twas the night of a Hashrun<br>
and all through Big River<br>
We were ready for fun<br>
Would this MailMan deliver?<br><br>

The group was nestled all snug in their coats<br>
While 2 Polar Bears fucking scribbled his notes<br>
We set out in mass excited and runny<br>
and immediately got lost-- haha, very funny.<br><br>

When suddenly on trail there arose such a mapp<br>
with a mystery drink stop-- mmmm yummy schnapp!<br>
Around the circle the liquor did make<br>
and songs were sang as sips we did take<br><br>

The moon on the breast of the very large pond<br>
Gave a vision to marks so our way could be found<br>
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
But a another drink stop-- hooray this time beer!!<br><br>

There sat the hare, with popcorn in hand<br>
We knew in a moment it must be SheMailMan.<br>
More rapid than eagles the other hashers came,<br>
Enjoyed were marshmallows, beer-cicles and campfire flames<br><br>

When the beer was drank and it was time to go<br>
we headed out the wrong way- what? oh no!<br>
the Marvelous 7 followed Crabs into the night<br>
WHO knew the way they were going was certainly not right<br><br>

Though they finally made it<br>
to the circle they went<br>
and crabby got hashit<br>
twas an evening well spent<br><br>

After the circle it was time for a pub<br>
with darts, more drinks and some On-In bar-grub<br>
As we left that night, it started to snow<br>
what a wonderful night for a hashrun, you know!<br><br>
