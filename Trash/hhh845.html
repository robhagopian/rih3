<p>The mystique and romance of Burrillville, RI has drawn hashers to its charms relentlessly, inexplicably and improbably 
for many years. There is archaeological evidence that the first hashers of the world, the Neanderthalic Fugawi Tribe, 
originally settled and began hashing in this locale using sloth vertebrae for marks and wooly-mammoth pelvises for check 
marks. Small wonder then that the hare's invitation to come to an event in the northwestern corner of this 
paradise-on-earth should result in what was the best attended RIH3 hash since the first famous <font color="#FF0000">Bondo 
Jovi </font>&quot;Forget-the-run-let's-sit-around-and-drink-beer Hash&quot; of 1986.&nbsp; Despite being hard beset by 
jobs, traffic, spouses, and confused sexual orientation, the RIH3 nevertheless arrived. On time. In large numbers. 
Accompanied by visitors! And virgin(s)!</p>

<p>First to arrive at the Buck Hill Fire Tower at 6:15 was <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO,</font> who needs the extra time 
as he has large bone-structure making it difficult to change clothes in a Japanese car. The hare and <font 
color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font>, arriving in the hare's vehicle soon joined him.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">
Hopeless</font>, an involuntary backslider, had at last been released from home confinement when his wife was unexpectedly 
able to arrange a secret tryst with a recently unemployed mayor. She shooed him out of the house saying: &quot;Now, go and 
have a nice hash, dear. And don't worry about coming home too soon. I'll just be waxing the floors.&quot; Next came <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>. True to form, he parked and got out his bicycle and a beer. He then threw a few dozen 
milk-bones in the middle of the road to see if he could create havoc or at least knock off one of his dogs. As always, 
Jake and Ben were smarter than <font color="#FF0000">Bondo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket, Snotty</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> then pulled up, followed by 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing, Trail Hoover </font>and the virgin <font color="#FF0000">Just Alex</font>. Parking was at a 
premium as 6:30 arrived. The hare had been told that <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> was planning to come. [Note 
how easily your scribe can resist the cheap shot.] No one wanted to listen to more complaining about being left behind 
just because she was 30 minutes late, so they waited. Surprisingly, she pulled in relatively promptly with <font 
color="#FF0000">Kneeling Room Only (KNO)</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Muffalotta</font>. What a crowd! It looked 
something like a gathering of aging groupies for the Olivia Newton John &quot;Let's Get Physical&quot; Reunion Tour. Or 
perhaps a large bunch of rejects from the French Foreign Legion recruiting drive. But I digress. A passing census taker 
took note of the large group, and stopped anxiously to determine if Burrillville would need a new zip code. Finally, even 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> arrived and all were even willing to wait for him to adjust his warm weather survival 
gear (hermetically sealed &quot;capri&quot; pants) before starting.</p>

<p>Instructions were given, and they were off. The trail began a few hundred yards east on Buck Hill Road and turned north 
on the famous Rhode Island North South Trail(!). Skirting the western slopes of Badger Hill, the terrain was pleasant and 
gentle, well marked and free from poison ivy and vermin. Pathetic! A few checks led off the North South Trail(!) into some 
light shrubbery, only to return to the trail a few yards up. <font color="#FF0000">The Snotly One</font> was heard to 
comment that this trail reminded him of the vicious jungle-shiggy of the Far East. Clearly he has been spending too much 
time amidst the manicured fields and stiled fences of the orderly English countryside. His memories of Rhode Island 
hashing have been distorted by the warm rosy glow that always comes when you hash a full ocean away from Glendale.</p>

<p>A check led east into the remnant of Cold Stream Brook. The pernicious effects of the drought were again noted, as the 
leaders <font color="#FF0000">Basket, Oozing, WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> crossed the rocky 
but dry river looking for flour. The rest continued north on what appeared to be… the North South Trail(!). An arrow 
pointed to a near vertical glacial boulder, and the leaders now <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck, Basket </font>and <font 
color="#FF0000">Hopeless </font>began to climb while <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dr 
WHO</font>, seeing that the trail skirted the east side of the rock, continued on the North South Trail(!) and took the 
lead. The theme was becoming clear: when you see an arrow, do the opposite. And follow the North South Trail(!). <font 
color="#FF0000">Basket</font>and <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> now shared the lead, continuing north and slightly 
west. Meanwhile, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, Trail Hoover, Short Peck, Just 
Alex </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Muffalotta</font> made up the middle pack.  <font color="#FF0000">Muffalotta</font> 
dropped back, probably because there is little more unnerving than the crashing, grunting, gasping and thudding sounds 
one hears when being followed by <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO.</font> They came to the Benson Mountain Trail (a road) and 
turned west briefly, then turned back north on the North South Trail(!). The hind parts of the group were sticking with 
the hare who was carrying flour to mark the checks. The [end-results of the] hind parts of Baxter were sticking to <font 
color="#FF0000">Short Peck's</font> shoes, a different style of marking. <font color="#FF0000">Snotty</font> continued to 
comment on the rugged nature of the hash and inquired about the origin of the smell.</p>

<p>Your scribe did not see <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> on trail. When finally he turned up as described below, he 
was not forthcoming in details of his adventures. Nevertheless, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo's</font> recent history allows 
an educated guess. With the first check mark leading into shiggy, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>probably followed 
trail, fell off his bike into some bushes and had a flat. Back up on the North South Trail(!) he was going good until he 
fell off his bike into some bushes and had another flat. Profanities were inevitably heard on the North South Trail(!). He 
realized that the obvious beer check was at the Tri-State Marker found at the northern terminus of the North South 
Trail(!) so he got back up, and ignored the flour. On his way northeast (on the North South Trail(!)), he undoubtedly had 
a flat, and then fell off his bike into some bushes. But we will never know.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, now followed by <font color="#FF0000">
Dr WHO</font>, came to a check. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, thinking like <font color="#FF0000">Bondo,</font> 
(now there's an image for you!) continued on the North South Trail(!) while <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turned east, seeing flashes of Wallum Lake through the trees to the north. A little-used 
path along the ridge above the shore was the true trail. Ben accompanied the two and made valiant efforts to trip them 
both up as they ran. A &quot;BN&quot; was found, confusing Hopeless for a while as he naively thought this mark meant that 
there was actually beer near. Finally they came to the &quot;B&quot; and began searching, soon joined by <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Just Alex</font>. The beer was found and they moved into the lake 
to cool down, while the rest straggled in. As they cooled in the water, a slick of sweat, bug repellant and God knows what 
else widened around them. And Pascoag thought they had problems with their water before this!</p>

<p>They sat and chatted, drinking and waiting for the last few still missing: <font color="#FF0000">EverReady, KNO</font>, 
and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Picturing the fate of the Grand Mattress with this duo, some grew concerned. A 
search party was considered. Horns were sounded and whistles blown, frightening several fishermen and causing a 
wake-boarder to fall into a rock. The noise carried across a small bay, and the muscular orderlies from the psych wing at 
Zambarano Hospital began taking an anxious inventory of their criminally psychotic patients to see if one was on the 
loose. KNO arrived, and said he had no idea where the Beaver might be. Just as <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and he 
started back to search the North South Trail(!), <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> arrived. She apparently had been 
following bicycle tire tracks, crushed bushes and discarded inner-tubes until she finally realized she hadn't seen flour 
for a while and made her way back. But what of Bondo?!!&nbsp; Could he be lost? Or even hurt?! No one seemed to care, so 
the group headed for the next stage.</p>

<p>East and then south they ran and walked until they came to the Benson Mountain Road again.  <font 
color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> turned east with the cooler of beer from the 
lake. They were followed by most, feeling that a sure thing shouldn't be risked for the possibility of more beer at an 
uncertain On In. But the virgin <font color="#FF0000">Just Alex</font> turned west on the road, and found beer at the 
circle a few hundred yards away. The hare shepherded the rest to the clearing and the circle was joined when the native 
bearers returned from <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless'</font> truck.</p>

<p>Hare in the circle. The ratings were proffered. The hare had not provided true shiggy. The hare had not been blessed 
with hashing weather. The hare had resorted to the North South Trail(!). But then, there were three bimbos! Bondo got 
lost! There was a swimming stop! Overall rating: 69!&nbsp; The hare was punished, made a poor excuse for singing, and 
the ceremony moved on. Only to be disrupted by the arrival of the missing <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. His pathetic 
excuses and whining were too much for most, and a recall of votes was demanded. Scores were revised and the hare was lucky 
to come away with a + 0.69.</p>

<p>Next: Visitors. After a brief legal discussion about the distinctions between visitors, renegades, and backsliders, 
the visitors were determined to be <font color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover, Muffalotta</font>, and <font 
color="#FF0000">KNO</font>. They did a down down, and might have sung, but your scribe doubts it. All that your scribe 
could see was <font color="#FF0000">Muffalotta's</font> ring (and that was fine) followed by the spontaneous, redundant, 
and unnecessary exposure to <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> same (which was not). Somehow, this led to the singing 
of the dread Panzerlied. Most had assumed that this particular phase of <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> had long 
since ended. But it was not to end here. The virgin was next and was asked the three questions at which he completely 
failed (excellent hash material). He was told to sing and thinking by example that this was expected of him, he started 
another Nazi Anthem. The angry crowd soon drowned him out. Finally hashit was discussed. Who but <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> could be nominated? He was punished but it was pointed out that there was a Hashit-For-Life, 
and <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was back in the circle. Enough was enough, though. &quot;Swinging Low&quot; ended 
the solemn ceremony. They carpooled back to the fire tower in <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless' </font>truck, careening 
wildly through the now darkened roads.</p>

<p>The On On On was at George's Pizza in the village of Pascoag. All attended, which caused quite a stir in this 
establishment which heretofore had never served more than four or five (not including farm animals) at once. They were 
also much bemused by <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS' </font>special order pizza. He crafted this in his mind, imagining a 
savory yet lactose- and sauce-free vegetable pizza. What came out was a cardboard-like agglutination of starches and 
wilted greens that even <font color="#FF0000">Async </font>and the dogs wouldn't touch. But there was beer. There were 
soggy napkin missiles. There was scintillating conversation. [Note: your scribe for once was located sufficiently far 
from both <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> that he may be speaking for himself 
on this one.] A fine evening was had by all (although some of the group may yet be circling Burrillville trying to find 
their way out, as to an impartial observer, it appeared that the roads had been rearranged during the course of the hash 
and whichever turn was taken seemed to lead back to the North South Trail(!)).</p>
