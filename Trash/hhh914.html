<p>Summary for Run #914, October 20, 2003</p>

<font color="#0000FF">Scribe: </font>Basket<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Location:</font> Douglas State Forest, Wallis St Entrance, Douglas, MA<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> 40's, Clear<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Present:</font> Async, Dr WHO, WIPOS, Bondo Jovi, EB RIPTA (NH3), Fuwangi Boner;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Late:</font> Oozing, SD, SESYB, Basket Boom Boom. Also: Ben, Jake, Seamus.<br><br>
<font color="#0000FF">Run: </font></p>

<p>A counterclockwise loop, shiggy-free, with little pavement, but no moisture, briars, or law-enforcement agents. Started 
southwest on Ridge Trail, turned onto loop trails north towards Wallis pond (missed opportunity #1), curving back to Ridge 
trail west, then multiple zig-zag checks, generally SW, avoiding the feeder stream for the pond (missed opportunity #2). 
Checks were negotiated effortlessly by <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> in the lead until he missed a simple left 
parallel to Rt 16 leading to parking area and beer check across the road. BC: Sam Adams Octoberfest, Bass and skunked 
Guiness. On Back parallell to 16 on the south side to a long falsie south, made longer through the efforts of <font 
color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, and resulting in the complete and total disorientation of <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font>, who went Fugawi for about 90 minutes at this point finally, an opportunity seized!) The rest crossed 16, 
and continued east, then north back to the Ridge Trail and the cars.<br><br>

Ratings: 6.9 for loss of <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi,</font> loss of <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>who arrived for 
the circle, and missed the run completely, and for the Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine which clouded the senses of all 
present (and even made them consider a rescue mission for<font color="#FF0000"> Fuwangi</font> at the end of the circle; 
this stuff is dangerous!)<br><br>

<font color="#0000FF">Hashit:</font> <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, no, <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>. What is 
up with this, anyway! Blatant discrimination and bald-faced malice, I call it. You are all a bunch of wanks, and if I keep 
getting this, I am going to trot out some of my forty verse songs for you. Or perhaps repeated renditions of 
&quot;Poisoning Pigeons in the Park&quot;!<br><br>

On On On: Hannahs, no, Gators, for Guiness, Bass and free buffet of pizza, wings, subs, and noodle dishes. $6.00 per 
person. Woo-Hoo!</p>
