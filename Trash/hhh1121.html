<p><font color="#008000">Run #1121</font>, September 24, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; WIPOS</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; East Providence/Seekonk</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Clear, 60’s</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Concrete Feet, Dr WHO, Just Miranda, Basket Boom Boom, Async, Oozing SD, 
Just Anna, Fuwangi Boner, Bondo Jovi, Ben. Visitors: European Whore (?), Hung Like This – Pittsburgh H3. Virgins: Just 
Amy, Just Sarah.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Perhaps it’s a good thing that <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font>, <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Mouthful</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> have been MIA for a while, because, for the second 
week in a row, the once all-gay RI Men’s hash was graced with feminine participation in our stupidities. And, not one or 
two bimbos made it, but FIVE! And two had returned after running with us in the past! One came two weeks in a row! Before 
long, we may actually get a crowd. (Hint to hare and others that try to get away with only 10-12 beers at the BC: stop 
being so cheap! And don’t even think about beers with a fruit or vegetable theme!)</p>

<p>At any rate, amazed by the attendance, the by-now-worried-about-not-having-enough-beer-at-the-beer-check hare started 
the pack off five minutes late. This was still in plenty of time to avoid the always lost <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> and the always late <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. After unintelligible instructions from the hare, they 
left the ball fields near Ferris Ave in EP, and turned south from the beginning of the bike path. Trail was led by <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font>. The path rapidly turned to a bushwhack through 
briars, and probably some poison ivy. This hare want’s to ensure that no new boots ever return. (Of course, the sure way 
to kill off any interest in hashing would be to have beer made from some sort of gourd or squash or something, at the BC.) 
Trail led south on the shore of the Turner reservoir, through a few back yards and on into more briars.</p>

<p>The front pack rapidly was bogged down by the underbrush on the true trail, while the hare led the two virgins, and the 
whiners (<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, you know who you are!) on an easier path parallel. By the time <font 
color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font>, and <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> made it out to Newman Ave, the rest of the pack was already across continuing on the 
Turner Reservoir Loop Path. (Except, of course for <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, who upon arriving late promptly 
turned north, packing his own beer, and met with some other aging fairies in Slater Park. But that story is best left 
unspoken.) (But at least his beer wouldn’t turn your skin orange if you drank too much.) The light was now dimming to the 
point where it was still too bright for flashlights to be effective, but dark enough to allow <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO
</font> to amuse <font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font> with some spectacular trips and falls.</p>

<p>The pack came out onto Pleasant Street and a check. True trail turned left, and crossed into Seekonk. The lead pack was 
caught as they dealt with another check sending them right on Zitter St, then through a backyard into the woods. Trail led 
to the Ten Mile River and, inevitably, across below the dam. The water level was low, and getting wet was only optional. 
(Much like drinking beer flavored with orange vegetables is an option in life. One that few would voluntarily choose! But 
I digress.) Once across, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> led on with <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> further south 
west away from Hunt’s Mill to a nearly dried up branch of the River. This was crossed with varying degrees of mud 
immersion. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> found true trail along a fence and this was followed to the banks of the 
river and a “B”.</p>

<p>While awaiting the hare (who was escorting the virgins and trying to undo some of the damage the earlier part of his 
trail had done), they searched for the beer without success. Finally he arrived and they opened the meager supply of 
Pumpkin Ales. Pumpkin Ales? What was he thinking? Or was he thinking at all? (One can always guess what might be on sale 
at Yankee Spirits when <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> is hare!) The beer was opened, and some songs begun. <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> arrived. Spirits sank. But <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was still in Slater Park. 
With Ben. <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> Feet was missing. Things were not all bad.</p>

<p>After making due, they turned to the On-In trail, smelling like a group of muddy, sweaty Jack-o-lantern’s. Trail went 
north, the underbrush grew dense and the group got fed up. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Fuwangi</font> turned east and found the partly paved road that led back to Pleasant. With <font color="#FF0000">Just 
Miranda</font> (who was waiting to see if <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> would oblige her with another dramatic fall, 
or at least run into a tree or something), they back-tracked along the reservoir loop. <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Hung</font> and <font color="#FF0000">European</font> 
opted for the roads, and the two groups met near the corner of Newman and Ferris. The hare followed his own trail to his 
hidden van, and gave <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Just Anna</font>, <font color="#FF0000">
Just Amy</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font> a ride back. (But they had to pay, as the hare’s van smelled 
like a pie-eating contest on Thanksgiving Day outside Walmart.)</p>

<p>The group circled behind the ballfields on the bikepath. Ratings for the run: Considerable pavement, lack of a 
well-marked On-In trail, autohashing and incomprehensible beer selections weighed heavily against the acceptable shiggy, 
the five young ladies, the full moon, the five young ladies, the blood loss, the five young ladies and the river crossing. 
And <font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi’s</font> more than generous 10 F rating. And the bimbos. Total: <b>+0.069</b>. The 
visitors were questioned, the backslider was punished, and the virgins were initiated. Everyone got off on the bus, <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Sarah</font> became an instant hit by claiming her favorite sexual position was “anywhere you can 
stick it!”, and the square-root of 69 was contemplated. Hashit was given to <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, for 
nothing more specific than “it just felt right!” Religion closed the circle.</p>

<p>The two virgins of course promised to return, depending upon the flight schedules at T. F. Green. But they couldn’t 
make it for dinner. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, of course, headed back to Slater Park. <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> had had his fill for the month, so he was off. They rest reconvened at the Red Bridge Tavern. (They serve 
some seasonal beer in bottles at Red Bridge, but there was NO sign of ANY PUMPKIN ALE there!) With only a few fries 
making it into the beer, and a quick song or two, the evening was over on an unusually quiet note. Last week, it was 
predicted that none of the newcomers would show up again. Your scribe was wrong. But next week? <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo’s</font> hash!! All I can say to the newcomers is: read the trash for any <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> “run” 
before you trek up to Woonsocket, and be warned!</p>
