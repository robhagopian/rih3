<p><font color="#008000">Run #1004.5</font>, July 2, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Rumney Crags, NH.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 80, clear.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hounds:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangii, SummersEveSevenYearBitch, and Basket.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Late Cumer:</font>&nbsp; Oozing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Climb:</font></p>

<p>Once started, this Hash had no where to go but crashing downhill.</p>

<p>The way to the beginning of our climb, however full of hope and expectation at the start, was precarious, as we made 
our way, from the parking lot to the first cliffs. <font color="#FF0000">DryFoot</font> led the merry men and woman from 
the RIH3 to the, first ever, Technical Rock Climb Hash.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font>, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
followed like lambs to the slaughter, with no hesitation. It was an obvious sign that they had way too much beer the 
night before, and were in no condition to make major decisions on their own.</p>

<p>The trail to the Parking Lot Cliff was along a soggy well worn path, over rocks, boulders and around trees, going much 
higher than one need this early in the morning. Luckily, the parking lot cliff was full of people hanging on ropes and 
dangling precariously off precipice and overhang. It was evident to all of us but our leader, that we’d be unable to 
climb and live yet another day.  Our Hare was not deterred however, and offered to take us to his second choice for 
today’s climb, ‘the Orange Crush’.</p>

<p>Having been told my testicles were somewhat larger than normal (<font color="#FF0000">Dogmeat</font> summer of 1968 on 
our first date, “They’re HUGE! Not like the other guys I’ve had sex with. More like Oranges than Walnuts.”). I was 
feeling a bit uncomfortable between my thighs thinking about how that name arrived. Still we pressed on, ever higher, 
hoping that the wall would be full already and we’d be unable to kill ourselves yet again.</p>

<p>As we made our way to our destination, we passed routes with names like: Juicy Fingers, Slick and Brendan’s Bitches, 
which seemed more inviting than others named the Skewer and Shishkebob. We finally settled on Orange Surprise. This one 
was interesting as to get from flat ground to the start, one had to climb out along a razor edge outcropping and stand on 
the lip over a thirty foot drop, then lunge onto the main wall. Without the aid of ropes or other protection at this 
point, we all voted to have our Hare make the first leap of faith and connect the ropes to the first fixed pin.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">DryFoot</font> chose <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> to be his second and hold his rope. 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> was comfortably clipped into a belay point, as <font color="#FF0000">DryFoot</font> 
made his way to the wall and started the ascent. There was a sigh of relief as he reached the first pin and clipped in. 
At this point he could only crash his head against the wall, but not fall down between the rocks and die. Pulling the 
rope behind him, he made his way spectacularly along the route, ever higher, tying in every 10 – 15 feet or so to the 
next pin.</p>

<p>We were all so impressed with his manly prowess, as we watched him go ever higher. When he reached an over hang that 
was a bit more difficult, he fell slightly, but <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> held on. Who said he was 
unreliable?</p>

<p>When he reached the top, we all rejoiced and looked around for a beer to celebrate. The Hare forgot to bring it, so 
this run rating was starting to go down as quickly as <font color="#FF0000">DryFoot</font> repelled to our location.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> was next, as he was the next experienced person to try this sport. He had been 
explaining the technical aspects of climbing to <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> like Edmond Hillary to Tenzing Norgay 
on their first attempt. “Just hold onto the rope and everything will be just fine. It’s quite simple really, keep your 
feet under you and climb higher than you’ve ever been in your life, and don’t look down or worry about falling. I’ll be 
right here.”</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> made his way along the knife edge and with the solitude that <font 
color="#FF0000">DF</font> had already done it, started up the wall. He was doing quite well, until he came to the 
overhang. He tried and tried to find the finger hold <font color="#FF0000">DF</font> used to climb over it, but to no 
avail. Like a girly man squatting to pee, he sat down on his harness and was lowered down by <font 
color="#FF0000">DryFoot</font>. It was sad, especially since DF had already done it, and all of <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangii’s</font> experience was now for naught. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> and I were sorely 
disappointed as we stood there looking up at this broken (girly)man.</p>

<p>When <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> finally made the base camp, I clipped into the rope and started my ascent. 
I felt like a spider making its way along a familiar route. Without hesitation I made the Khumbu Ice Fall, and Camp II to 
the Lhotse Face, which has now been renamed the Fuwangii Ledge. With the stealth of a gazelle, I reached up into a crack, 
and pulled myself over the lip. I was standing on Fuwangii Ledge, and I could feel the relief from my fellow climbers 
below. They knew I would go where <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> failed. Standing on the top, I viewed the world 
below, and raised our Hash flag next to the US flag.</p>

<img src="Images/RumneyAssult/three.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="20" vspace="10">

<p>I made it back safely, and now it was <font color="#FF0000">SESYB’s</font> chance to show up the more experienced 
climber.</p>

<p>As she started to the top, we heard a familiar “Whoohoo, who hoo hoo’s”, from the bottom. It was our long lost sherpa 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. He had slept in from a Birthday party the night before and just arrived. <font 
color="#FF0000">Trail Hoover</font> made it up without hesitation, and it appeared to <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> 
that this was going to be a cake walk. She made a couple interesting moves with her butt giving us all a wonderful view 
of nature’s glory, and we enjoyed watching her progress, I’ll say. Finally, making it to the Fuwangii Ledge, she showed 
more sympathy for <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> than <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and returned directly to 
base camp.</p>

<p>Now, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> started up, and did so noisily, as his knees kept knocking against one 
another. He did make it past the Fuwangii Ledge, and condescendingly told <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> it was 
easy. This of course raised the hairs on the back of <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii’s</font> neck, so he had to make a 
new attempt to save face.</p>

<img src="Images/RumneyAssult/four.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="20" vspace="10">

<p>When <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> made base camp, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangii</font> didn’t hesitate this 
time. It was as if he was riding on the back of his sherpa.  We watched as he made it up and over the ledge forever 
etched with his name, and reached to top.</p>

<p>We were ever so proud, and decided to call it a day and get some beer. We considered leaving him up there, but decided 
we’d be labeled as the team that left trash on the mountain. When he arrived back at base camp, we packed up and made our 
way back to the lake for a few well earned beers.</p>
