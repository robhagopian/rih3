The You've Been Warned<br/>
Run #1680, May 21, 2018<br/>
Hare: Donkey Punch and Pubic Housing<br/>
Location: Tillinghast Pond/Wickaboxet Management Area<br/>
Weather: a lovely warm spring day <br/>
Present: Read below you lazy bastards<br/>
Hashit: Basket <br/><br/>
The Hare did his best to sell this Hash. It's a proven fact, that if the Hash believes you will lay a shitty trail, with shit beer, and promises to be an uncomfortable if not dangerous trail, some Wankers will believe it and not show. This keeps a lid on the beer bill and if he/she wants to nail the coffin, they put it in Timbuktu. Donkey has used this ploy more than once and some of us are starting to catch on.<br/><b>
THIS IS AN A TO B TRAIL, THE START AND END ARE AT DIFFERENT PLACES, SO GET THERE EARLY. HERE IS A DIAGRAM TO EXPLAIN:<br/>
A -------------------------- ><br/>
<-------------------------- B<br/>
IT IS NOT DOG FRIENDLY, IT IS NOT OVERLY WALKER FRENDLY, STAY WITH A BUDDY<br/>
The trail will be poorly marked, have thorns, and swamps. Wear your shiggy shoes, lower leg protection, BRING dry socks and shoes, head lamps, BUG SPRAY and leave dogs and whining at home. <br/>

So it was that Basket, Butt Plug, WIPOS, Shemale Man, Just Pat, Crotch Tiger, and Pussy Galore joined the Hares: Donkey P and Pubic H for what was found to be much more gentile then advertised, and maybe the best laid trail by this duo. For those that got scared away with Donkey's rant, you missed a good one.<br/>
The Trail started out with a drive to the lot on Plain Meeting House Rd, from the parking lot on Plain Rd, we were Car Hashing to the start. Chalk Talk was brief, but it did have something about all Check Backs will be 3, and not all the trail was marked. Just Pat led the pack past the trail head and a check was quickly found at the first intersection. Left was towards the end, so true trail took the pack right. The next check found us going into brush, but an arrow put us back on trails. Unfortunately, Basket heard no calls and wandered for a long time until WIPOS's horn called him on. The next check put us in the swamp, and it was here we'd be for the majority of the trail to Beer. It was mostly moist until we closed in on the pond at Phillips Brook. Trail led over a grand beaver dam. The specter of a very large snapper shell did little to stop the pack treading gingerly over the dam to a beer stop along the opposite shore. <br/>
A goodly selection of beers and snacks kept the singing to a minimum, but the view and a couple wooden ducks kept us entertained. Back on trail, the Hare said we were half way, but the trail back would be mosty on trail and out of the shite. Circling back at the cars brought mostly compliments about the trail, with Shemale posting a two thumbs up, resulting in a positive 69. No backslders or visitors, the discussion of Hashit was long and painful. Most everyone was nominate for something, but mysteriously, it fell to me. Something about caughing up a lung during most of the trail. Either alergies or some misplaced fiberglass shards in my lungs caused me to almost die. Maybe I got it for not dying....someday, someday.<br/>
