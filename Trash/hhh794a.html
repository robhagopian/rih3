<p>The directions were more than adequate, as a matter of fact, and this may
sound like a fine whine, the directions were a bit redundant. It could have been
simply 95 to exit 6A, go left 669 feet on left, but I digress. On the finer
points of tonight’s event: no <font color="#FF0000">Slasher Dr. Who</font>, no
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo Jovi</font>, no Jake, no <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>,
no <font color="#FF0000">Short Shorts,</font> no Ben, no Baxter, no <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>,
no <font color="#FF0000">ShineOn</font>, no<font color="#FF0000"> Fergie</font>
or <font color="#FF0000">Hopeless</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Gobble Gobble</font>
or even<font color="#FF0000"> Itchy Bro</font>, and what ever happened to <font color="#FF0000">Little
Neck</font>? Well, I guess the &quot;No’s&quot; knew something we poor
suffering bastards didn’t.</p>
<p>The pack waited for a reasonable amount of time, to see if anybody with half
a mind, might show up late, and without <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> to
push the panic button we enjoyed the lovely weather and deer flies. At 6:47:23
sharp, the hare pointed us down the dusty road toward the Great Swamp and our
eventual fate. Traveling east by southeast, (is that 150 degrees <font color="#FF0000">Slasher</font>?),
we found our first check about 1969 feet. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
checked out the left trail into the woods, and could hear <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
calling, &quot;On One, On Two….&quot; going straight. <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>found nothing more than a couple of turds left by some careless fisherman
by the pond, he turned back towards the now growing fainter sound of the pack
traveling East at 105 degrees, along the dirt road and further into the woods
straight ahead.</p>
<p>As he got out to the street, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was waiting
and asked why he hadn’t found trail. The pack was still on &quot;ON Two&quot;,
so he turned back, going over the turd and paper to the fishing access area,
where more manure and paper littered the ground. This was surely going to be a
shit hash, he thought until off in the distance he saw the bastard hare take
off, laughing in a hysterical Paki manner.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>got back to the street, and found another
trail leading due west of the check at about 269 degrees, and since the hare
didn’t follow the foolish into the woods, he check out this one.<font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> found 3 checks in a row, and a couple of Hungarians off on a
tangent, so he called the pack with his trusty horn. Only <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> followed. Of the others, they,
having good navigational instincts and personal knowledge of the area, said,
&quot;FUCK ‘EM&quot;, while we continue on true trail.</p>
<p>The trail meandered: east then south, then southwest and west, or for the<font color="#FF0000">
Slasher,</font> 98, 175, 169, 205, 253, 291, and then took an abrupt northerly
trek and up a steep grade at 352 degrees directionally and 17 degrees
vertically. The <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> thought he would stop for a
minute and smell the roses, and dove quickly over his handlebars. Not finding
roses among the rocks and tree roots, he mounted his trusty bike and followed
the fearless and flawless <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> sprinting over
fallen tree trunks. <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> waited at the next
check, as <font color="#FF0000">SP</font> went west and <font color="#FF0000">Basket
</font>east, approximately 180 degrees of each other. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
found true trail and called the something less than a 6 pack onward.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, luckily, hit the next 4 checks
perfectly, and was well in front of the daring duo, when check number 5 did him
in. Remembering that the hare said, and I quote, &quot;All false trails are
marked!&quot;, he continued for about a mile in a generally southern direction
until his good sense figured he was YBF’d. Turning around he saw an adjoining
trail and soon found a check coming in from the opposite direction. He could
here <font color="#FF0000">Oozing’</font>s whistle in the front of him, then
in the back, then in the front again, and he found all checks had be pre-marked
to the correct direction. The Hare thought <font color="#FF0000">Basket </font>was
in front of him and was marking the trail for<font color="#FF0000"> Short Peck</font>,
but soon discovered <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> coming over the hill
behind him. A sheepish look overtook his Moslem features, and he turned from
Usama bin Laden, to a foolish little Paki boy with his left hand stuck in the
Tandoori Roti jar.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> arrived and we traveled another mile
before coming to the beer check, where the so far missing were found. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
had already finished his second Heineken (that’s what I said), and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
was cleaning his bike off with his wife’s underwear, which he had been wearing
as a mosquito net. After a couple of songs and finishing off the last of <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's</font>
light beer leftover from his father’s visit, we continued to the cars and
circled up.</p>
<p>The Hare got a down-down for shitty trail and beer, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
decided to keep possession of the Hashit, and we were in the middle of a
beautiful and melodious Swing Low, when down the road, kicking dirt in the air
and our beer, long hair flowing behind her was a young lady. It wasn’t a lady
at all, as we found out soon enough, <font color="#FF0000">Mother Goose</font>
came running down the path to a resounding finish, cut short by her arrival. She
was invited into the circle to explain her whereabouts for the past 5 years, and
all prayed she wasn’t going to go into her alien abduction story as it was
getting late and we were hungry. No excuses were given, and she started downing
her Bass Ale (a little better than a hiney), but she couldn’t finish. Being a
gentleman, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> offered <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font>
head for a receptacle, when a better idea overcame her, and she poured it down
his shorts. Ahhhhhh!</p>
<p>The On On was at the little pub a mile west of 95, and most joined in for
good, good, good, good libations. All but <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>,
that is, who, as his custom, chose to take advantage of the on-on to consort
with the hash wives and girlfriends suddenly left without anything to do on
Monday nights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guinness and Bass were on tap for Black and
Tans and food was ordered. We continued our festivities in good Hash fashion and
found the rednecks in need of some entertainment. They decided the jukebox was
good enough, and turned the volume higher. Food consumed, beer gone, shorts
sticking to the seats, we left the bar with much approval from the regulars, and
look forward to the lame sorry excuses next week.</p>
