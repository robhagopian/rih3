<a href="http://www.getcustoms.com/holbk/holidays/tun_hol.html">Tunisian
Evacuation Day</a> and Baxter's 2nd birthday (69 in Hash-Dog years).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#3333FF"><i>The Run:</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hard-bitten and grimly determined men of Easy
Company gathered near dusk with a firm... No, that's not right. It was the
confused and oft-incontinent wankers of the RIH3 who gathered near dusk at the
#1 hash site in RI: Cady's Tavern,&nbsp; the only place on earth where the
arrival of a group of hashers will actually raise the real estate values. Apart
from <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> the custodian of Baxter's drool
cup, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was first to arrive, followed by<font color="#FF0000">
Dr. WHO</font>. Both were in work clothes (hashit?), and the two of them began
to change doing their 'dance of the seven veils and hernia trusses' in their
cars as the others arrived. <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> had <font color="#FF0000">Dr.
WHO</font> change her batteries, but this was OK because he is a medical
professional. And he has a huge recharger. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
was almost unrecognizable in his full winter garb, ultimately protection for
which he would not have any use on the trail to come. The hare showed up with no
evidence of shiggy about his person, followed by <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
Jovi</font>, Ben, Jake and finally <font color="#FF0000">Oozing </font>who came
disguised as a twenty-something blonde debutante from the Hamptons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Baxter was visibly excited and ran from car to
car, producing massive quantities of unusually viscous and odiferous drool as an
offering to the canine shiggy-gods. Likewise the hare was so worked up that
while giving instructions, he began spilling large quantities of white powder
all over the parking lot. Despite the likely fact that the usual patrons of
Cady's were not blessed with the mental acuity to be suspicious of white powder
on the road, it was decided to leave a note for their reassurance. It read:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Plese to know that this poudre is only
grund weat, and has none wotsoever of dedly antracks or other naughty and bad
Taliban trix etc. sined: Bas'qet al Bumbum.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hare gave directions stating that the run was
to be A to B (which caused great rejoicing within Cady's, as the group would end
their shenanigans elsewhere). He boasted that each tree would have powder at its
base. He claimed marvelous shiggy. He pointed west and said &quot;Go&quot;. Off
west on Putnam Pike they went, led by <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>.
A quick turn to the north past an unidentified building with large amounts of
garage space, and they were into the woods. But persistent PATHS, lack of FLOUR,&nbsp;
NO briars, and NO shiggy would plague the group, ultimately resulting in the
temporary misplacement of <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
AND the tragic loss of 4 FBI agents who were following the suspicious crew and
ended up drowning in DRY ARM BROOK far to the north [this also resulted in the
unfortunate hand injury incurred by your scribe when his wife discovered that he
had been misusing the CAPS lock key again and she had to discipline him with a
ruler].</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The banks of the Bowdish Reservoir were reached,
and followed to the east and north. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was too
clever to follow the trail (WHAT TRAIL?), and so set off on his own. He was
determined to miss the beer check and to get back to Cady's where a lovely with
seven intact teeth had promised him a vision of paradise. Thus <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font> led, his pate a beacon to the rest of the crew. Except of course for
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, who decided that the trail [WHY IS THERE NO
FLOUR?] must lead to Sofa Spud's home, as visited in the &quot;Robbie Burn's
Run&quot; last winter. As a result, he circumambulated the Bowdish Reservoir
one-and-one-half times. To your scribe, an inexperienced but hopefully acute
observer, this suggests a pattern. Why is it that, when confronted by water, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
must go all the way around? What could it mean? Tarbox Pond, Stump Pond, Carr
Pond, Burlingame Reservoir and more all have been circumnavigated by the worthy <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>,
in fruitless search for beer. Perhaps if we led him to the shores of the&nbsp;Atlantic,
he would run for all eternity, a &quot;Flying Hashman&quot; whose sighting would
signify a momentous event, a clash between Good and Evil (or at least
temporarily stop &quot;Miss Cleo's&quot; commercials on TV). Never mind. Along
the reservoir went the rest, east to a feeble excuse for shiggy where the hare
had laid trail in the lake, two yards away from obvious dry land. Only <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
got wet. <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> led on, now north and west past
a shelter and into the woods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following the Pecker were <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>,
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dr
WHO</font>, and the hare who made frequent excuses for the lameness of his
trail. &quot;Oh, it rained real hard after I set the trail.&quot; &quot;Oh, I
can't believe this check mark was washed away!&quot; &quot;Oh, I think the beer
stop is this way... No, it's this way... No, I'm lost! Oh, help me, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing!</font>&quot;
&quot;<font color="#FF0000">Async</font>! <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>!
Where are you?&quot;&nbsp; After running back and forth on the George Washington
Road at least four times, a bugle signified that the hare had at last found HIS
OWN beer stop. At shelter #1 the beer was found and a group consisting of the
hare, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing, Dr WHO, WIPOS, EverReady</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Short
Peck</font> enjoyed Trinity Brew whilst awaiting <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
and<font color="#FF0000"> Async</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Meanwhile, back at Cady's, <font color="#FF0000">PW</font>
had arrived. Terrified at the sight of white powder in the parking lot, he
urinated on all the cars with On-On stickers, and went into Cady's. He soon
received an education in human physiology from the waitress with seven teeth.
The rest is better left unsaid.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The beer stop was marked by unfortunate
incidents. <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font>, following the instructions of
the hare (this must be a hashit offense), brought presents for Baxter. The first
was a device whose nefarious design cannot be mentioned upon these
family-oriented pages. Suffice to say, it was quickly stolen by the hare,
inserted into the nether regions of his anatomy. This device made suggestive and
squeaky noises whenever the hare bent over throughout the night. Second was a
leather whip. All of the group gasped with envy. Baxter's lack of opposable
thumbs made this a questionable gift for his birthday. I mean he is a dog, after
all. The hare begged for personal punishment with Baxter's new toy. It went
unused however until, like a zit with pus that has reached the pressure limit,<font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> burst from the woods and joined the group. The shameful loss of
beer, whipping, spanking, more spanking, and general naughtiness that came next
cannot be described (although it would doubtless make <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
green with envy). <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font> gave everyone shots (in
case the Dept. of Health is worried). At one point, the group heard <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
in the woods. As soon as he heard the whistles, yells and trumpet sounds, his
noises unaccountably went in the opposite direction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following the hares directions from the beer
check, the group went on southeast to a right turn on the&nbsp; 'blue' trail,
then to the North-South trail (which always seems to go East-West). Either way,
it was missed. The main party went back and forth until the hare's bugle called
them southeast to the second beer/On-On stop.<font color="#FF0000"> Async</font>
was found by the fire, a major upset. But, when the fire was stoked, and the
sausages and beans were warming and the circle was joined, it didn't seem so bad
after all. Hare in the circle. Ratings were confused: <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
was imbecilic, <font color="#FF0000">EverReady</font> was inexplicable, <font color="#FF0000">Dr
WHO</font> was incompetent, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was infantile, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>
was implacable, <font color="#FF0000">Short Peck</font> was indefinable, and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>
was indescribable. The dogs were ineluctable. When the mathematical minds had
calculated the returns, it was: RIH3 - 6.9, Manchester United - 0. But, I
digress. Multiple songs were sung, in multiple keys. [Astrologists in the group
speculated that when the planets were aligned properly (once every 3000 years),
the RIH3 could expect to all be on key at the same time.] Hashit to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>
because he's <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. Crimes committed were too
numerous to punish as the hare had insufficient beer to down-down everyone three
or four times. Thus all are expected to pay a monetary fine to the Hash in the
amount of $273.49, to be paid to<font color="#FF0000"> Dr WHO</font> (as the
monetary representative of the RIH3) immediately, and without reservation. And
in cash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After dinner and fire hazards, on back they went
to Cady's. A hardcore of the Hare, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo, Oozing, Short
Peck, Dr WHO, WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> went in to the
bar. The others went home. What happened at Cady's? Scenes of debauchery,
licentiousness, dead bear molesting, and St. Bernard taunting occurred the likes
of which I cannot describe, because they are too awful and I am too damned tired
to continue this nonsense anyway after all I am only human and my wife's out of
town and the kids are driving me crazy and the hemmorhoids aren't exactly my
idea of a good time, whatever, and I'm sorry it took me so long to do this write
up but it sucks anyways so why are you complaining you sorry sons-a-bitchs who
wouldn't know the bleeding <a href="http://frontier.gibnet.gi/laws/utrecht.html">Treaty

me already.</font></p>
