being the hare dressed in apparel suited to the occasion had the best set
of curtains I have seen turned into a kilt, with the Rhode Island sporran

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A nip of the amber nectar sent was had by all
prior to the on-on being called, down the drive and the pack immediately
dividing into two groups both going in the wrong direction until the hare
blew the now famous raspberry to indicate that the trail was into the woods,
the cold evening of 23 degrees F kept the pace brisk, a couple of crafty
checks found yours truly way out in front which is unusual at this stage
of the game, burning the trail for all of two minutes before another cunning
check near some private property caught us all out, it was not long before
the hare got cold waiting for the sniveling hounds meandering around looking
for scent, signaled the trail onto another check which again sent the pack
into a spin, eventually the only route was down the road with local residents
looking out to think the local asylum must have had another breakout, or
maybe an older version of Mel Gibson acting out the American modern day
version of ‘Braveheart’. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Down the road for half a mile before entering
woods again, just before the men in white coats turned up. Before long
the first stop was made with refreshment being fine scotch malt which tasted
sweeter than normal due to the fact the container had been kept in the

he was told it was an offense to use a cellphone on the run and could result
in </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> getting
back the honored prize. On down hill with the hare losing his bearings
slightly due to the consumption of by now two bottles of scotch. Checks
were getting difficult to see with the pack running on like a pile of dickheads
being led by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hopeless</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
who had just got to the front and was having difficulty staying there after
a two week absence, obviously sucking tit for the last 5-6 weeks has rendered
the poor chap with poor vision, or has it been all that wanking! Everybody
else was following so were all the runners wankers? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Another scotch stop with few volunteers for a
quick nip, a cunning set of marks leading up the rock face an easy climb
for we experts, until being called on down to the true trail. Past a fire
tower which is apparently alarmed to stop anyone from walking away with
it, onto the true beer check with cream stout being offered to all, by
far the best grog of the year turning this near disastrous run of the day
into a successful event. The on back was straight forward with yours truly
finishing in gold medal position, another rare event. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All runners back the circle up was held in the
garage of bike mechanic Keith, where </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">again recited the Pumpkin song in an accent
that can only be an attempt at Scottish which sounded like a pissed Irishman
trying to imitate a Welshman singing whilst screwing a sheep. During the
circle up </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sajid</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
immediately picked up a ringing phone which was not his, shouting I did
not perform the operation last week, until he realized the call was a local
hells angel not wanting to have his chain pulled. The run was eventually
rated as 6.9, probably overrated due to the absence of shiggy, usual ceremonies
completed it was on to the grub. The on-on was back at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket's</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
house where haggis was the order of the day. Congratulations to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dogmeat</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
for a great job, the Burns poem was read in an almost Scottish accent.
Plenty of fine scotch, beer and ice-cream hence I have to upgrade the run
overall to a 9.5, as ice-cream is always worth an extra mark or two, for
imagination. Tapes were watched from recent inter hashes where </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
believes he saw Dogbird on the screen, it was actually Batman and Robin
but that’s what too much scotch does. The failure of inoperational bagpipes
I am afraid takes the run rating back down to -2.9 which is just above
average for the year. The consensus was this could be a great venue for
a summer run, great job. Good time had by all.</FONT></P>
