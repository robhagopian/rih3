It was a small pack at a familiar place, but enthusiasm ran rampant. WHO and the Hare were discussing politics and enjoying a beer as I pulled into the lot, It's now a dumping ground for mulch and brush by the town of Portsmouth. The smell of decaying vegetation was not as sweet as when Rusty brought us here after the Christmas season. Then boughs and remnants of Xmas trees was a lovely change from what we would soon have as we circumnavigated Melville Pond. It's a stinking sewer of red/green algae and invasive species. It does have a lovely view of the bay since they've taken down many of the trees that once graced the shores of the Navy's swamp. <br/><br/>
PG, Crotchy, WIPOS, and OOzing were counting down the seconds as Just the Tip and OMIT pulled in. Trail led out, in an all too familiar way, down the dirt road to the main path. At the second check OOzing went right and I took the second right. At mark #3, I called out OnOn and continued for another 15 marks. At about mark 5, Rusty started calling, "On Back!" Since I was on trail, I fully expected that was meant for the other wanker to join me. At mark #14, there was a property on my right, and the owners were enjoying a bonfire and drinks. They asked if I had lost a dog. Replying that, 'No. Running a trail and there's a group of runners that would be following me soon." I was wrong. The trail ended and not hearing anyone behind me, I turned around. <br/><br/>
At a small bridge, I tripped on a stone, tripped head over heels and I think I broke my toe. As I continued hobbling along I arrived at a check that was marked to my right. I started out, but quickly changed my mind. The Hare said there'd be a W and a B check. I decided the B would be found by the water, I turned around and started back in that direction. I soon hit the On In trail marks and made my way to the opposite side of Melville Pond. The Hare had said you would not find the beer until I got there. So I took a chance and looked along the riprap leading down to the pond. It was well overgrown since we were last here, and difficult to find anything. I then searched the bank leading to the bay and ran into a fence. Finding a trash bag that looked like garbage, I picked it up, only to find it was filled with filled cans of beer. I grabbed a Captain's Daughter and waited on the path for the pack to arrive. <br/><br/>

Just the Tip was first and he had a beer in his hand already. It seems he had shortcutted here before me. The pack soon arrived and Rusty pulled out his Baileys and cheese for my enjoyment. A few songs were sung and with beer finished, we made our way back. At the Circle, the comments were mostly negative, except for the cheese lovers. OMIT thought it was all delicious, and JTT almost broke his arm patting himself on the back for being first to the BS. With no other excuses to make someone drink, the Hashit was discussed. Just the Tip should have received it, but in the end it was passed to me. Some of us continued the celebration at Aidens in Bristol and then went home for the night.
