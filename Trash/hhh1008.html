<p><font color="#008000">Run #1008</font>, July 25, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 80’s, HHHH (Hot, Hazy, Humid, Hellish).</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Purgatory Chasm, Sutton, MA.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dry Foot Fairy, Dr WHO, Tinker, Gives Great Head, Oozing SD, SESYB, Async, 
WIPOS, Seamus. <font color="#0000FF">On On On Groupies:</font> Bondo Jovi, Dogmeat, Ben, Jake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>Purgatory Chasm is out of the usual range for the RIH3 (although it has been done in the past). The hare was desperate 
to lose his reputation for unimaginative, shiggyless, agonizing jaunts through Glendale. So he came up with an 
unimaginative, shiggyless, agonizing jaunt through Purgatory. This hash foreshadowed our eternal destinies. It’s probably 
what we deserve. Hell on earth! The group met at an unmarked dirt parking area just past the on-ramp to Rt 146. Parking 
was at a premium, especially after <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> made a rare appearance, driving a shiny black gas 
guzzling mega-SUV. He has a new Harley, too. He’s embezzling again, most likely. Sold his soul, perhaps. But I digress. 
Promptly at 6:30, they headed out southeast on an old paved road.</p>

<p>They came to some powerlines and a check. Trail turned west, up hill. A brief bushwhack, and then they returned 
southwards on deer paths. Very dull, and predictable. Even the newcomer <font color="#FF0000">GGH</font> wasn’t fooled. No 
one was moving too fast, in the oppressive heat. They crossed a branch of the Purgatory Brook. This was nearly dry, but 
there was some mud on banks. Shiggy? A satanic taunting; shadows of what might have been. Pathetic. They turned west.</p>

<p>Finally, confusion ensued, not so much because of devilishly clever markings, but more because of the incompetence of 
the hare. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> led <font 
color="#FF0000">GGH</font> on trail along Purgatory Brook, looking for shiggy. They found more mud, dried and cracking in 
the heat of the Inferno. <font color="#FF0000">Dr. WHO</font> was shadowing the demonic hare. No help at all. Finally, up 
hill and to the north, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> found true trail. They 
were heading towards the chasm. But it was not yet to be entered, apparently.</p>

<p>Another check, still off trail sent <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> straight, while <font color="#FF0000">GGH</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> turn left through briars following sounds of <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, 
temporary FRB. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> as FRB! Now that’s hellish! They crossed the brook turning north and 
took a prolonged bushwhack to “Charley’s Loop”. The pack was mostly together by now as they continued west past the chasm 
trail. They came to an intersection and <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> led southwest to the brook, then north on 
bushwhack on the west side of the same brook. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, being ornery after being cheated out of 
the chasm, turned early and followed on the east side of the brook, on a comfortable path.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> led loudly and vocally, enthused by the thought that there had to be some shiggy 
ahead. He was sorely disappointed. No shiggy in hell, apparently. But the pack made their way across the brook, 
dry-footed, to catch up with <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO</font>. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> had come across some of 
the on-out markings, and was thoroughly confused. His natural state. He followed the pack reluctantly as they passed him. 
They continued on the path and turned up to a mini-chasm, complete with small cave. But was the beer there? No! The hare 
had foregone this place of natural beauty and scenic wonder to place his BC 50 yards up slope. On a nondescript part of 
the trail marked only by a few pitiful sprouts of poison ivy. This was indeed Purgatory!</p>

<p>The Beer Check was marked by a few songs, and a recycled beer that probably had been OK when it had first left the 
brewery, all those years ago. <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> toyed idly with a few ticks she had collected. The rest 
searched in vain for more of our little six-legged friends to put down the hare’s shirt. No one was lost, and yet in a 
fuller sense, all were truly lost. So to speak.</p>

<p>Beer finished, on out they ran. The hare had set a bushwhack east along the path in. Few fell for it, and most took the 
trail back to chasm. Marks led <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">GGH</font> northeast up the Charley’s Loop trail. They ignored 
the attempts of the hare to bring them back to his trail, down in Purgatory. From atop the cliffs they called down to 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>: “Abandon hope, all ye who follow the hare!”, “Suffer, ye lost souls!” and “We’ll see ye in 
Hell!” Some kids playing in the rocks with their parents on the other side of the chasm were confused. But following the 
hare has its price. And it must be paid.</p>

<p>The group high on the ridge easily made it to the parking lot. They came out on the road, and turned south to the cars. 
But back in the Chasm, the infernal trail took its toll. The intense heat nearly finished off <font color="#FF0000">
SESYB</font>. She made it to the street before collapsing. She required resuscitation. All volunteered to loosen her 
clothing. Finally <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> drove up and put her in his air-conditioned car. He drove her back to 
the parking area. The aroma of his running shoes worked like smelling salts. She awakened and quickly escaped into 
<font color="#FF0000">Oozing’s</font> vehicle.</p>

<p>All collected, they convoyed back to 290 Snake Hill Road for the circle. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was there. 
Satan chortled in Hell. They gathered around a kiddy pool, and rated the run: insufficient shiggy, no one lost, running 
out of beer, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> at the end; HHH (hot, hazy, humid), near heat-stroke for <font 
color="#FF0000">SESYB</font>, no <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> until the end. Total: <b>6.9</b>. Hashit: <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, for lame attempts to give it to someone else. They finished off with a BBQ: burgers and 
pasta salad. For the final proof that malevolent forces were at work, the Red Sox lost in the 10th to Tampa Bay.</p>
