<p><font color="#008000">Run #1122</font>, October 1, 2007</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Bondo Jovi</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Blackstone, MA</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; Clear, 50’s</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Concrete Feet, Dr WHO, Amish It Head, Basket Boom Boom, WIPOS, Just 
Miranda, Dogmeat, Ben. <font color="#0000FF">Virgins:</font> Just Colin, Just Eric, Just Seth, Just Liz.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>There is something inexplicable in the air in Rhode Island, this autumn. For no reason whatsoever, virgins have been 
showing up at the RIH3 on a regular basis. For three weeks in a row, in fact! It’s not the hares. (We have observed this 
phenomenon with <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, and now <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>!) It’s not the weather. 
(While clear, it’s getting cooler, and flashlights are out in force.) And it’s not the location (Woonsocket?!) Maybe it’s 
the presence of <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font>. Maybe it’s the absence of <font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and/or <font color="#FF0000">That’s a Mouthful</font>. Regardless, this evening four 
virgins showed up at the hare’s doorstop, expecting a hash and some beer. They were to be at least partly disappointed.</p>

<p>The hare waited until about 6:35, and announced that this was to be a “B-to-A” run.  He loaded up his van with the 
group to drive them to the start. There was to be no turning around, and lost virgins were likely to stay that way. The 
van was packed full (although <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> would have gladly made a place for <font color="#FF0000">
Just Miranda</font> on his lap, had she not been a bit late. She was later shepherded to mid-run by <font color="#FF0000">
Dogmeat</font>.) They drove. And drove. And drove! “The Wild West Show” was sung, and they ran out of verses before 
arriving at the starting point, at the turn in Fox Run Road in South Bellingham.</p>

<p>There is a dead-straight (unlike the hare) abandoned rail line heading northeast from Blackstone to Norwood. The hash 
has spent a lot of time on the Blackstone segment. But the hare has always been to lazy to travel out this far from the 
security of Woonsocket. So technically, the first part of the trail was virgin territory. And given the travel time, 
flashlights were needed almost from the beginning. So the excited virgins were pumped. They almost immediately got into 
the spirit of the thing as they started on trail heading southwest on the trail, shouting “On On!” at each mark. But it 
was soon apparent that the hare had set on bicycle, as the marks were at least 200 yds apart.  But it was pretty obvious 
that the goal was to go straight back to the hare’s house.</p>

<p>A check sent <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> left into a cemetery, only to serve as an example in courteous hashing 
for the new boots. The trail was dirt with a sinusoidal pattern of ups and downs. Hard on the lower back, especially for 
those with long black poles. Finally they came out to South Main Street. There was another check. It was ignored and they 
proceeded straight across to continue on the tracks. There were two parallel trails for a bit. It didn’t matter which was 
taken. All roads lead to <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>. They crossed over Harris Pond only to run into <font 
color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font>, and the hare. He pointed out a “BN”. <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> took the bait and turned back north into the quarries on a very familiar path. True trail 
even led to the totally unnecessary pond crossing that the hare keeps bringing back, in the vain hope that he will find 
someone stupid enough to cross. (See run <a href="hhh851.html" target="new">#851</a>, <a href="hhh875.html" target="new">
#875</a>, <a href="hhh956.html" target="new">#956</a>, etc.) <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> considered briefly leading 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font> and some virgins into the only shiggy on trail. But Good Hashmanship only goes 
so far.</p>

<p>At this point, believe it or not, people started to get lost. <font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font> continued north 
into the quarry on a check at <font color="#FF0000">Dr WHO’s</font> recommendation. Two of the virgins (<font 
color="#FF0000">Just Colin</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Just Eric?</font>) got carried away as well and went off in 
the woods together. (Luckily, they left <font color="#FF0000">Just Liz</font> behind, which really was all the hash cared 
about.) And <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> wandered off as well, following the lights of the <font color="#FF0000">
Just Boys</font>. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> cackled his pleasure as he jumped back into his car. <font 
color="#FF0000">Concrete</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> found true 
trail now which curved back and came out on Farm Street at St Charles Cemetery.</p>

<p>Trail was now on blacktop. But only for a moment. See if you can guess where true trail was picked up. That’s right! 
Across the street, on the rail-path, continuing southwest! <font color="#FF0000">Concrete Feet</font> led and guessed 
right (left) at a series of checks. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> hoped against 
hope that the beer would be waiting at the bench on top of the hill in these woods found at the last AGM hash. But they 
were to be sorely disappointed. Trail led out to Warner Street, and they finally recognized the obvious. There was to be 
NO BEER CHECK!</p>

<p>The FRB’s made their way back via Gaskill and Woodland to Meadow where they found the hare waiting in his garage. After 
berating the unrepentant wanker, beer was opened. More of the rest straggled in. But <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, 
<font color="#FF0000">Just Miranda</font>, and a few virgins were missing. The hare was dispatched to find them. Finally, 
all were present, and the circle was joined. The ratings reflected the imagination and effort put forth by the hare: 
total = <b>-69.69</b>! The virgins were deflowered and seemed to be ready for banyard frolics with cows, sheep and goats. 
They offered a song which, though not obscene, was certainly spirited. Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">Concrete
</font> for being an FRB and boasting about his running. Religion followed.</p>

<p>The pack was allowed upstairs by <font color="#FF0000">Just Big Sh*t</font>. High-Definition football was on in the TV 
room; Low-Talent billiards was on in the back room. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> brew and Woonsocket salt-free 
dynamites completed for the new hashers what is after all one of the quintessential RIH3 hashing experiences. And it’s an 
experience particularly piquant, for most, the next morning. Bet we’ll see them again soon!</p>
