<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">It was the 
hottest hash to date in 2008. And there were lots of deer flies. That much I 
remember. Little else comes to mind as this write-up is begun, nearly three 
months after the fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But here goes: we started from a gravel 
parking lot, just south of Ten Rod Road, on the west bank of the Wood River. The 
hare for once had not locked his keys in his car nor had his beer stolen by 
preadolescents. He pointed north, and so we began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail crossed 
Ten Rod Road, and turned immediately. It appeared we might be headed for Mt Tom, 
but a check soon proved the opposite and the hash turned east. Arcadia is full 
of trails, but all of them are long with few opportunities for checks, so the 
hare had to make do with a few short bushwhacks. The group crossed the Wood 
River for the first time. An opportunity for cooling off was 
welcomed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Trail came back 
to Ten Rod Rd, and crossed south. A check sent <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> 
further east. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> chose correctly through pure 
disorientation and turned west, back towards the cars. <font color="#ff0000">Oozing</font> followed. <font color="#ff0000">WIPOS</font> was not 
far behind. <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> was nowhere to be seen. Trail 
paralleled the road until it came to the river. It turned south and then 
crossed. Another chance to cool off. This was not bad at all. Except for the 
trout. They had a rough time that day, I can tell you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">We now come to 
the part that is not clear. As anyone who (is an idiot and) has read the recent 
write-ups should know, these details are a bit sketchy. I mean, it’s been three 
months. I do have a life you know! All I can say is that if a beer check is not 
memorable, then I won’t be able to rememorablize it three months later. I’m sure 
the hare did his best. But it wasn’t at an island in the stream. It wasn’t on a 
cliff overlooking a pond. Again, it must have been at a non-descript rock along 
the path. If I am wrong, I apologize. Do the write-up yourself next time. 
Waah!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Actually, the 
one thing I do remember is that <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> and <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> were lost. What a surprise. As the pack came back up 
Mt Tom Rd and returned to the cars, <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font> was found 
drinking his own poison at his van. But no <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>. 
After a brief spell, the hare went back on trail. <font color="#ff0000">WHO</font> 
went out by car. Unfortunately, he found <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font> 
walking north on Mt Tom Road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The circle was 
begun. Ratings were favorable: loss of <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>, river 
crossings, shiggy and lack of pavement. However, no bimbos. But that’s OK by us! 
Total: +6.9! Hashit was given to <font color="#ff0000">Bondo</font>. Why, I can’t 
think. So I hereby retroactively reassign the Hashit to <font color="#ff0000">Basket</font>! There, much better! After religion, they went off 
to the Black River Pub(?) on Rt 3. And that’s about it. At least that’s all I 
can remember.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
