<font color="#0000FF">Late Cumers:</font> <font color="#FF0000">KNO, Eager Beaver</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">Mr. 
Peabody</font></br>
<font color="#0000FF">Dress Code:</font> Kilts for the brave - <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS </font>gear for the 
intelligent<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font> Low teens to single digits before hash ends. Clear Sky. Brisk Wind 20-40 knots.</p>

<p>It was an unusually cold night, and wind was 
whipping snow up me kilt like wind devils on the Moors. As 6:30 approached, car 
engines with heaters on full blast were turned off, and we started to emerge 
into the cold night air. It was colder than a witch’s nipple covered with ice 
cream, which may be tasty, but very dangerous. Much like tonight’s run, standing 
on ice covered tarmac, looking across a field of deep snow. Thoughts of our Hare 
setting a mercifully short trail, especially since a number of us were standing 
in Kilts, and our boys were shriveling down to frozen pea size.</p>

<p>The pack decided to get this show on the road, so 
off we headed through a fence into the snowdrifts. Seamus’ leash was dropped 
somewhere, and by the time I returned to my car, took my frozen keys out of the 
gas cap and opened the door to look for it, the pack was long gone. “On On” in a 
delicate voice was called over the car tops in the wind, as the arrival of
<font color="#FF0000">Eager Beaver </font>and <font color="#FF0000">KNO </font>
was made known.</p>

<p>She was dressed a beautifully pleated kilt, 
underneath an extremely heavy, and I’ll bet warm, topcoat. <font color="#FF0000">
KNO</font> was WIPOScized in winter garb that would be the envy of most normal 
people. Asking which direction the pack went left me at a loss, so we ran 
straight into the field looking for footprints. It was a much-traveled area, so 
not much help was found, but reversing our path, we could hear sounds radiating 
from a distant clump of trees.</p>

<p>We climbed a hill and could hear the pack running 
not too far off, but had to make our way down a steep and ice covered bank. 
Straight ahead was what appeared to be a field, but mid-way across, it was more 
evidently a frozen pond. The pack could be seen now running the circumference, 
with torches ablaze and On On’s carrying over the lonesome ice. I ran straight 
ahead towards the front of the pack, thinking I had shortcutted a good deal of 
the trail. Looking behind me, I could see the lights of the bimbo and her 
squeeze slowly making their way down the embankment. He must have been afraid of 
falling, and she held back to help. He is from the BH3, you know.</p>

<p>As I got closer to the pack and the end of the ice, 
the snow cover became less and less, as if the wind suddenly blew it all away. 
As a matter of fact, the ice was crystal clear, almost nonexistent. Standing on 
the last edge of snow-covered ice, I peered at the clear ice to determine how 
thick it may be, when suddenly I was standing crotch-deep in, not quite, frozen water.</p>

<p>I turned back to find Seamus looking forlorn and 
possibly thinking why he was following me to begin with, when he crashed in 
himself. With not many options left, I raised a leg above the ice and broke off 
a bit and moved forward.&nbsp; Seamus followed, as I continued crashing my way to 
shore, and thankful that it was not any deeper. As I climbed, through thorns, on 
the bank, I could feel my fingers start to crack, and my arse start to creak. I 
had to eventually get on all fours to claw my way to the top, amid cheers and 
catcalls at my adversity. “You’re gonna die!” <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> 
called out. “Shortcutting Bastard!” said <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>. 
“That’ll teach you, you silly bastard!”…Etceteras, etceteras, etceteras…. What a 
considerate bunch of A holes. The warmth they showed was almost enough to thaw 
the ice of my you-know-what's.</p>

<p>We all traveled along the riverbank, loosing trail 
once or twice, before arriving at the beer stop. The Hare couldn’t have picked a 
colder location. On the banks of a river, wind blowing across, straight up our 
skirts, and mine now a frozen crust like a hoop skirt of the 50’s.</p>

<p>Beer and song ensued for some time, as we waited for 
our late arrivals. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo </font>not having much humanity 
for the late cummer-hashers, and took off for the finish, once he had had 
enough. The Sweater Jake had on, was also frozen much like my kilt. He evidently 
found water too, and Bondo removed it, surprisingly, thinking of the X Grand 
Master not himself. Maybe there’s hope.</p>

<p>The On In trail was pretty dull. All side streets 
back to 152 and into the Library Parking lot. We did have a few heads turn, as 
we entered, and we were a sorry looking lot. We found our cars and some dry 
clothes. Not thinking I needed any when I packed the car, as this was my only 
kilt, I kept the frozen cloth wrapped around me and drove over to the bar.</p>

<p>We were to circle up outside, so I ran in with a 
cooler filled with the feast of Scots. Haggis, Taddies and Neaps, gravy, now 
this is the stuff that keeps what’s under the kilt warm on a cold winter’s 
night. The barmaid asked what was in the container as <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font> and I entered the side door. “Haggis” I exclaimed, and she looked 
at our attire, turned around at the bar, and asked if she was on Candid Camera? 
Then had us explain why we do, what we do, when we do it.&nbsp; She said it’d be fine 
to eat sheep organs in the bar, and I ran outside to circle-up.</p>

<p>The Hare got his Down-Down, along with
<font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> (Hashit) for complaining that someone wasn’t 
there. Then we realized it was Bondo missing, and promised to move the Hashit in 
his direction very soon. <font color="#FF0000">Fawangii Boner </font>got one for 
having his priorities all wrong and doing something else on Mondays. The happy 
couple announce wedding intentions, and a round of&nbsp; “Just Say No!” was followed 
quickly. We’ve been invited to join them on St. Margaret this summer for the 
sorrowful occasion.</p>

<p>Then we Swing Lowed and went into to bar, where
<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> was sucking down a Guinness in proper 
fashion. Beers were ordered, and a glorious trio of <font color="#FF0000">
Oozing, Dr. WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> recited Burn’s 
Address to a Haggis, and we cut the bonnie beast. Yummies were heard across the 
table, and we were just glad <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> wasn’t 
there…more for the rest of us. A toast of single malt made it’s way around the 
table and more beer and lesser food was ordered and consumed in fine fashion.</p>

Great chieftain o' the pudding-race!<br>

While thro' your pores the dews distil<br>

An' cut you up wi' ready sleight,<br>
Trenching your gushing entrails bright,<br>

And then, O what a glorious sight,<br>
Warm-reekin', rich!</p>

Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive,<br>
Till a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve<br>

Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive,<br>
Bethankit! hums.</p>
