<p><font size="5" color="#FF0000">Halloween Hash</font></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Run #1074</font>, October 30, 2006</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Amish It Head (Scottish Pirate)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Providence, RI</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; High 40’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Dr WHO (Captain Spaulding), Justin My Ass (Glad-he-ate-her), Eenie Weenie 
Dick (Evil Priest (with Small Pleasures)), Bondo Jovi (as Shine On), WIPOS (Evil Bicycle Schoolgirl).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>For the second week in a row, the RIH3 rejoiced in the absence of <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font 
color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, who 
remained off in the Far East experiencing new forms of debauchery. For Halloween, our hare promised more of the old forms 
of debauchery. Expectations were low. Expectations were met. The group gathered in a parking lot off Holden Street, behind 
the Foundry near Providence Place.</p>

<p>The costumes were confusing. Perhaps there was a cinematic theme. The hare got lazy and wore a kilt. The hare likes 
kilts. (Bravefart?) <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> got pithed. (<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> could recognize Groucho 
Marx in “Animal Crackers”. Every one else was looking for a stingray barb in <font color="#FF0000">WHO’s</font> chest. 
Since when did the Crocodile hunter wear a pith helmet?) <font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie Dick</font> chose a priest 
outfit with inverted cross. (Very Giallo!) (For those ignorant non-illegal-film-downloading wanks, see: 
<a href="http://www.braineater.com/misc/giallo_intro.html target="new">http://www.braineater.com/misc/giallo_intro.html</a>
.) <font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> chose a roman soldier/gladiator outfit. (Saturday morning and nothing to do? 
Try a Steve Reeves Movie!) <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>? Not a clue. (Perhaps he was trying to evoke the heroine in 
“Barn of the Blood-Eating Llamas”. It wasn’t a success.)</p>

<p>Promptly at 6:30, they were off. Trail led downhill on Holden, and as was obvious, turned left under 95 and the mall. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led, closely followed by <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> and <font color="#FF0000">JIMA
</font>,. They crossed Francis St. and without missing a beat, proceeded into Waterplace. The trail crossed the river. 
<font color="#FF0000">JIMA</font> went straight for Union Station Brewery. The more upscale <font color="#FF0000">WHO
</font> tried the Capitol Grille. <font color="#FF0000">EWD</font> waited while <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and the 
hare proceeded down along the south bank of the river. They regrouped at Memorial Boulevard.</p>

<p>After some brief attempts to find trail at the base of College Hill, they continued along the water, and then turned 
back to Kennedy Plaza. A check at the skating rink sent them southwest on Westminster to a series of very annoying and 
unnecessary checks. Ultimately, they crossed past Johnson and Wales, and came over to Point street. They crossed the 
bridge. Pretty much together, they turned up Wickenden, and ended up at the Wickenden Pub for the Beer Check.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the cars, <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> had arrived. (As near as could be ascertained, he was 
dressed as Yvette Mimeaux in “Where the Boys Are”.) He got on his cycle and tried to catch up. He never made it beyond 
Kennedy Plaza.</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1074/1074-2.jpg"></p></center>

<p>The Wickenden Pub was empty except for the hashers and one young lady who, after taking some pictures for the group, 
listened to a few songs. She was not tempted to join the group. She left muttering something about going to see her 
therapist. The bartender suddenly became very busy in the back. So the hashers had the place to themselves. This was good, 
because <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> was starting to smell a bit.</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1074/1074-3.jpg"></p></center>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1074/1074-4.jpg"></p></center>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1074/1074-5.jpg"></p></center>

<p>Finally, they were on out, the hare running low on cash. Trail turned north on Hope, past another photo op for the 
<font color="#FF0000">Eenie Weenie</font> one,</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1074/1074-6.jpg"></p></center>

<p>and then skirting Brown University, came down to cross the river again 
near the Capitol Building. They made their ways back to the cars and met <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>.</p>

<p>The circle was held in some ivy adjacent to the parking lot. Ratings for the run: despite the pavement, the lack of 
shiggy, the lack of bimbos and the presence of <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, the lack of <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> more than guaranteed 
positive numbers. Total: <b>+6.9</b>!</P>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1074/1074-7.jpg"></p></center>

<P>Hashit: This was a tough choice, between <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>,</p>

<center><p class="blue"><img src="Images/1074/1074-8.jpg"></p></center>

<p>but ultimately <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was triumphant. The circle 
concluded, and they moved on to The Wild Colonial. Another fine time was had by all.</p>
