The Hare was more than a bit worried about Haring so close to his house, especially with the crowd that started building 'bout 6:15, but not more so than having the OnOn at his house. Luckily it was across the street from the Church of St William, and he had much to pray for.<br><br>
The start was from Shaw's Marketplace on Warwick Avenue. The pack started with a little prelube, just to brace against the long journey ahead. The Hare warned about having to cross the Pawtuxet, warned that is was not 'Dog friendly', and told me I was stupid for bringing Dog Meat. He said nothing about Short Shorts, Nibbles, Pussy, Crotchy or Crabby. I think he's got a thing for my wife.<br><br>
Trail started out behind a fence towards the river, but soon found us bushwhacking back towards the market. Trail then took a turn for the worst as we found ourselves running back on Warwick Ave, crossing the bridge over the river, then a right on Dartmoor Ave. Much too much street for our liking, so the complaints were flying madly. 
I was with Async, as we watched Shemail lead a pack back into the woods in the direction of the river. We decided it better to take a right after crossing the small foot bridge rather then the left the pack took. We found flour and were pretty proud of ourselves having shortcutted the shiggy. Unfortunately  we were soon running smack back into the pack coming from the opposite direction through a baseball field. <br><br>
Turning around again, we discovered the river crossing and started across with the pack. I missed the hobo park where Hairy was making plans to spend some time playing his banjo and drinking PBR's, but we did find the IPA. Songs were sung with much enthusiasm until the beer was gone. Then it was back to the parking lot and circling up at Amish's.<br><br>
His garage was prepared for us. Lot's of beer in the kiddie pool filled with ice. Crock pots of chili, chips and dip, a the barbi was grillin'. But first the circle, the Hare got his just desert, as did the visitors and backsliders. Meanwhile, Wee Balls, Flo and I were adjusting the neatly arraigned Amish stuff so neatly displayed on the walls. The ladder went up to the rafters, a roll of wire was unrolled, a motorcycle helmet was taken from it's perch and placed where it didn't belong. It was good fun until the old maid returned from his barbicuing duties and caught us. I was unjustly accused of endangering Dog Meat or something similar and bestowed Hashit. Soon it was time to go and leave Amish to put his crib back in order and thanked St William it was over.<br><br>
