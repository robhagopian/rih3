A group of 18 wankers filed into the parking lot for Frosty's Virgin lay. WHO, Basket, OOzing, WIPOS, Pubic, Donkey, Amish, Just the Tip, Butt Plug, The Tird, Crotchy, Eticlit, Pussy and Just Kirsten were joined by two virgins from Rusty's Soccer club, Just Mike and Just Melinda, for a cold run through some familiar terrain. An unnecessary circle jerk, at the beginning through the shiggy, and around the power grid station had all fooled except those of us, that have seen this all too often before. WHO and I ran straight towards the tunnel, followed by Amish and the Tird. The pack caught up with us as we tiptoed around shiggy near the tunnel under Rte 24. under and onto the other side of the highway. <br/><br/>
A check had the pack split up again, sending the Tird right with most of the pack going left towards the gas line. Slowly, we worked our way toward the beer stop on trails, or bushwhacking over, under and around all sorts of obstacles and shiggy pits. Beer was found on a hill over looking darkness, with the occasional light from the remainder of the pack as they approached the BS. The bag with a few containers of beer, cups, pretzels and double stuff Oreo cookies was found and gleefully enjoyed. Basket was a bit hasty with the cookies, spilling beer as he reached for the package, and dropped the sweets into to spillage. None fell out, happily, still Amish complained about old men and wastefulness.  Many songs were sung. Donkey started with As I was Walking Through the Woods, then A beer for the Dehydrated with a When the End of the Month Rolls Around finish. OOzing brought back When I was 8 Days Old, and I started British Soldier. Amish started Waaa down in Barcelona, just so Rusty would have to rethink his choice of DD song. Then Donkey started Seven Old Ladies. This was song of the week. Thank you Donkey for bringing that up; it's a good one. Unfortunately, only 2 verses were remembered. We need to practice that one. A few others were nicely done by the time we finished the beer. <br/><br/>
Back on trail, the Hare, almost, apologized for not finding a route back, but chose to use the Buttplug method of retracing our steps through the tunnel and trails to the start. JTT and B3 found a new route through the briers and scrub rather than the proper trail and old roadway, and most of the pack made it back safely, save Rusty WHO had a close encounter with some prickly briers across his face. <br/><br/>
Rusty and Frosty enjoyed a DD for their efforts and, as the Waaa song was already done, Rusty pulled out a nun joke. The joke was on us, however as he said the very same joke last week. Pathetic! Backslider Just Kirsten was interrogated by Pubic, drank her DD and was helped with singing When I was just a little girl. Virgins were abused by Donkey and enjoyed a beer too. Saying they enjoyed themselves, and that they'd be back again, after calling Rusty a bastard. All agreed with their assessment. Buttplug stepped up as last weeks Hashit, admitted he didn't do a write-up, and pointed out a number of people WHO deserved the Hashit this week. Alas, it fell on me, despite my best in not having the cookies hit the ground. I sang I don't want to join the army. <br/><br/>
A swing low and we were off to the 110 Grill in Fall River for more sustenance. When we were here last, January 1, the place was packed and we thought this was the new 'IN' place, but there were just 2 folks at the bar and our waitress complained it's been dead all week. The selection of beer was good, and despite my insistence that the philly cheese steak was the best I've had in a long while, it didn't match up with the last one.<br/>
