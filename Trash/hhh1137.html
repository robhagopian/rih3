<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;4/12/08: Still summarizing what I can’t remember. When
<font color="#FF0000">Justin My Ass</font> is hare, the wise hasher stays in bed 
(possibly with <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s wife</font>, since he seems to 
show up, no matter what). There was fresh snow (about 5”) on the ground, making 
the parking area at Heritage Park in Chepachet a bit dicey for the Light cars. 
The hare greeted me as the first arrival with the news that a) it was about an 8 
mile trail, and b) the only beer he had was Busch Lite! I immediately tried to 
back out of the parking lot, but my spinning wheels soon dropped my gas mileage 
from 50.6 to 48.5 mpg, so I had to stop. Luckily <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> had both thought to bring decent beer. 
Take note. This kind of planning ahead should be SOP for a <font color="#FF0000">
JIMA</font> trail in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> was last to arrive, and 
strapped his skis on, the rest stuck with the traditional shiggy shoes. Off they 
went, with many a misgiving. Trail was marked in completely invisible pink 
Kool-Aid (perfect for <font color="#FF0000">Basket’s</font> color-blindness). 
The ‘marks’ led southeast. There was an early check that led to an unmarked 
falsie that effectively was the straw that broke the camel’s back.seven marks 
over some rocks and downed trees leading to nothing. Not a footprint. Not an 
“X”. The hare chortled. The rest came back to the trail, now marked with
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS’</font> ski tracks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FF0000">Basket, Fuwangi</font> and I followed 
the footprints and ski tracks. A check which led either to the trailer park or 
back to the main trail was encountered. We chose to range for marks along the 
main park trail. <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
Concrete</font> stuck with the hare, at least for a while. Ah, the lure of Busch 
Lite! It became clear to <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi </font>and me that the 
best course was to circle back to the cars. We knew that <font color="#FF0000">
Basket</font> had left some beer in the snow next to his car. I brought out (and 
made the mistake of showing <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>) my new GPS 
which I had been trying out, and we went straight back to the parking area. 
Nothing at this point was clear to <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> who by 
this time had lost his glasses in the snow. Basket was off in any direction, as 
usual.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Back at the cars after about 1 ½ miles of pleasant 
wintertime jogging, we opened some beer and waited. I don’t know exactly when
<font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Concrete</font> 
rebelled against the hare and turned back. I don’t know how
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> ever found his way out without glasses. I 
don’t know why <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> keeps showing up for these 
things when he knows the hare will be marking in red or pink on fresh snow. But 
somehow, everyone made it out of the woods.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The circle was joined. The pack couldn’t decide whether the 
actual trail encountered was even shorter than the hare’s previous world record 
attempt (See Run #1108). Or whether the marking was even worse than his last 
attempt at Heritage Park (See Run #1128). Regardless, this was another memorable 
one. Total: -69069! Hashit went to <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> for 
technology on trail. We swung low and headed for Chester’s. And that’s all there 
is to say!&nbsp;</p>
