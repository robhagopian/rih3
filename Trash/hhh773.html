<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was a beautiful day. The storm was seen coming
a week before. The atmosphere was set for a perfect nor'easter. In the end
however, the storm was far from perfect yet made up for the imperfections that
came along with the run, Basket attempting to outdo himself, but falling short
again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hounds gathered early included <font color="#FF0000">Async,
Dr WHO/Slasher, Bondo, WIPOS</font> and your scribe <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>,
and of course the K9's Ben, Baxter and Jake. A ploughman cleared part of the
carpark for us (obviously) and the hare showed up early for once. The snow was
coming down fast and a stiff breeze was blowing actually the stiff was Jake
happy to see Baxter. The navy-hashers couldn't find a civvy to steer them thru
this storm and chose to stay home. As WIPOS commented, this separated the boys
from the real men altho' which category we were in.....One look at the motley
crew revealed people thinking this was a <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
look-alike party with heavy winter coats being a favorite. <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>
chose to keep his distinguished coat and with a stroke of geni-ass even by RIH3
standards, chose not to lay a conventional trail but set it live
in...footprints!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Of&nbsp; course it was only fun for the
FRBs but no-one minded.&nbsp; Off the hare went behind Chelo's on 44, under the
power lines as we gave him just over the count of 7(the number of the day). The
pack soon set off chase and went up the hill under the power lines following the
only footprints venturing out today altho a gun was heard going off in the
distance(?),and thru a check, straight and then into the woods to the right,
circling back towards the new mall construction site. Here it became a little
trickier, but <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and the good <font color="#FF0000">Dr</font>.
soon found trail to a bunch of pipes! Now beer was promised in tube number 7,
but as we could'nt count beyond 4, it was a good thing the dogs came out from
hiding!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Good beer was had, and with the snow
falling down quite heavily now, the pack broke out into melody. With beer
consumed, the pack set back to the cars to see the ploughman still at it (ploughing
that is!). Circle-up was under the roof of Chelo's now well below zero and
windy!&nbsp; Down-downs to the hare and hashit <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>,
with more new songs and the swing low and the ONON at...<font color="#FF0000">Bondo's!</font>
His van that is. With the storm all pubs were closed and so the pack devoured
chicken (we hope it was cooked), and pita-bread with Trinity beer and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>
soon was falling out of the van. He was lucky not to be thrown out of this joint
but this was our first, and the way things turned out, possibly not the last
party at this joint! The pack voted this gay joint BYOB of the week. Who could
write this bunch of half-brains off? Off home then after quite a fun-filled eve
altho if <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> made it back home it's a wonder how!
