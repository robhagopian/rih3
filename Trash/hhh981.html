<p>For the day after the “Blizzard of 2005”, the hare had had to reschedule the Rabbie Burns run because the haggis 
man wouldn’t deliver in the storm, and the hare was fresh out of sheep gizzards. But the location for the run 
didn’t change, so the hare had no excuses. He brought along some extra snowshoes, and as the group gathered at 
Atlas Pallets on Rt 7, they were all well equipped, except <font color="#FF0000">Async</font>, who opted for his 
usual shiggy shoes. The trail was marked in red chalk on snow. The hare is colorblind. Great!</p>

<p>They started promptly at 6:30, turning southeast on Rt 7 to a dirt road on the left. Marks led east into the St 
Teresa’s Shrine. But soon, the marks disappeared, and were replaced with snowmobile tracks. The excuses were flying 
fast and furious. Most felt that the hare had never bothered to set marks anyways, relying on footprints. But the going 
was slow, even more so with snowshoes or skis. <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> was the least hindered in the 
light powder and was quickly out of sight. It was only the lack of marks that kept him from too great a lead. <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> found one of the 3 marks seen that day and ended up taking an unnecessary loop to 
the Stations of the Cross. Directed by the hare, the main group continued east and turned north after passing through 
a stone wall. &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">WHO,</font> <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> and <font color="#FF0000">
DFF </font>soon found &nbsp;true trail west across a small stream, and rejoined the hare, <font color="#FF0000">
Bondo</font>, and <font color="#FF0000">SESYB</font> on power lines heading slightly north of west. They ran uphill 
to a crest then downhill to the BC.</p>

<p>The beer check appeared to be an opportunity for the hare to get rid of some old bottles of various “beers” that no 
one in their right mind would have ever chosen to try. But, no one who runs with us is in a right mind anyways. So the 
beer was consumed. It was a quiet stop, and as it ended, &nbsp;most decided to follow<font color="#FF0000"> 
Async’s</font> lead and remove their snow shoes or skis. They continued down the power lines to Joslin Rd.&nbsp; and 
turned left. They came to Rt 7. True trail crossed, but &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> had had enough so they turned southeast and took 7 back to the cars. <font 
color="#FF0000">&nbsp;DFF, Fuwangi, Oozing, WHO, SESYB</font> and the hare continued and turned south into woods 
shortly.</p>

<p>There had been no snowmobiles here, so trail was through drifted snow. They were soon wishing they had left 
their snowshoes on. They followed footprints onto a straight grade southeast. Soon, they came to a small stream, with 
a broken-down bridge, and they made the crossing still managing to stay dry. Trail continued now paralleling the 
Branch River to the cars. The rest were already in their cars. They agreed to circle up at the hare’s house, and 
they convoyed over.</p>

<p>The circle was formed. Ratings: a lovely moonlight night, fresh snow, and at least 25 yds of virgin territory could 
not balance no one lost, short trail, no <font color="#FF0000">Just Ariana</font>, invisible markings and recycled 
beer. Total: -0.69. Hashit: <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>. Why not! They concluded the circle and feasted on 
meat pies. All were content, until it was pointed out that the hare would be repeating trail the next week, for 
the rescheduled Rabbie Burns run. O, the horror!</p>
