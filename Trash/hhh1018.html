<p><font color="#008000">Run #1018</font>, October 3, 2005</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Hare:</font>&nbsp; Oozing S.D.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Co-Hare:</font>&nbsp; Basket Boom Boom</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Location:</font>&nbsp; Adult Correctional Institute (State Prison), Cranston</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Weather:</font>&nbsp; 60’s, Clear</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Present:</font>&nbsp; Fuwangi Boner, Dr W.H.O., Tinker, WIPOS, Bondo Jovi, Dry Foot Fairy, Ben, 
Seamus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">The Run:</font></p>

<p>The RIH3 has a history of setting runs from questionable places. Places where one can get arrested. Places where one 
can get mugged. Places where one could get injured. But it is rare that a run is set in such a spot that no CONCEIVABLE 
excuse could EVER justify the presence of a hash, if apprehended. Tempting the fates almost to the breaking point, our 
hare and co-hare decided this night to go for broke. Picture a bunch of men, running around the Maximum Security Areas of 
the State Penitentiary, with flashlights, after dark, covered with mud, blowing whistles. Brilliant!</p>

<p>The start was at Mulligan’s Island, a driving range/batting cage/executive golf course inexplicably located just 
outside the outer barbed wire of the Adult Correctional Institution (ACI) in Warwick. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> were first to arrive. They waited in a dirt lot just above the pitch and putt area. 
<font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> were next. They parked in the main lot for 
Mulligan’s. Finally, the co-hare arrived and directed them to park outside of the gates, unless they wanted their cars 
incarcerated. They regrouped, appropriately enough, in a parking lot for the Mental Hospital. <font color="#FF0000">Bondo
</font> arrived. Notably, no women were present. Or were there?</p>

&nbsp;</font></p>
</center>

<p>Against all reason, the run began. They ran back into the golfing area, southwest on pavement, and turned south along 
the edge of the driving range. A check was found. Milling about, trying to find trail, without being the first one to turn 
into the prison grounds caused a certain delay. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> continued south with <font 
color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>, into some promising shiggy. The hares stayed back 
with <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>. An irritated attendant for the driving range approached. He pointed out that not 
only was the group trespassing, but they were in considerable danger with the balls from the range on one side, and the 
guns of the prison on the other. The hares quickly ushered the group onto the street, slightly north of east.</p>

</center>

<p>Now the hashers ran northeast, on West Road. They passed through the motor pool for the prison, and through various low 
security areas. Fortunately, being state workers, no one was around. The marks were in chalk, sufficiently obscure as to 
give <font color="#FF0000">Amish</font> a run for his money with respect to indecipherability. But with some prompting 
from the hares, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> took the lead as they turned south on Foster, and then northeast on 
the front lawns of some administration buildings.</p>

<p>They crossed Power Road. Trail now led into some bushes and southeast down a track in a tunnel under Pontiac Road. The 
path was overgrown and rapidly led to pools of slowly moving water, strewn with garbage. The smell was most offensive. And 
the water proved to be hot! The hares mumbled something about this being the boiler room overflow. Right! This was laundry 
room sewage, almost certainly. Great! Trying to clean our shiggy shoes! <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> took the high 
road through bushes and poison ivy, while the rest followed <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> into the worst of the 
muck. Of course, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> became FRB.</p>

<center><p><br><img src="Images/1018/4.JPG"><br><br><font color="#0000FF">Running through sewers adjacent to prisons! 
Brilliant!<br>&nbsp;</font></p></center>

<p>Out they came, led by <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> though a parking/staging area for the National Guard. Great! 
Get the military involved! But again, no one was present to object. <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> passed <font 
color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and headed southeast to Sharpe Drive. A check allowed the others to catch up and they turned 
southwest. A second check was found, on an overgrown dirt road. This turned the group northeast, parallel to the Pawtuxet 
River. But the relief from pavement was all too short. They emerged on Kenney Dr.</p>

<p>Continuing north on Kenney Dr. they soon came to a High Security Unit, with guard towers and double wire. A voice came 
over a loudspeaker, prompting <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> in the lead, to do 
a sharp about-face. And the hare showed that the trail did in fact diverge east down the sharp slope to the river’s edge. 
<font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and the hare proceeded down. The rest continued 
past the wire with <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, trusting that the loudspeaker was directed inside the wire, rather 
than at the hashers.</p>

</center>

<p>It was by now obvious that the hare had something special in mind. He encouraged the two joyfully. Trail did in fact 
finally approach enjoyable shiggy, with bushes, weeds and poison ivy obliterating the path that had once been there. 
<font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> and <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> followed marks until all of a sudden, they 
disappeared. Then the hare took over, almost eagerly. Anyone in their right mind would have rejoined <font 
color="#FF0000">Bondo</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font> and <font 
color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> up above. But then again, no one in their right mind would have shown up for this run in the 
first place!</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> led, of course, to a long and dark 48” sewer pipe. The three crossed under Kenney 
Dr, painfully crouched. There was a partial cave-in, half way. The hare and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> ducked under. 
But <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font> in the rear, was conserving his flashlight. He whacked his head on a re-bar. 
There were some nice sounds of further loose earth falling into the pipe. But unfortunately, <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi
</font> was not buried alive. They emerged only to climb back out and resume their northerly progress on Kenney. A 
complete waste of time! Contrived tunnel usage! Unnecessary shiggy! No cave-in fatalities! But the hare has been this way 
ever since he was a teenager in Europe.</p>

<p>The group ahead had not gotten very far. The trail led to a check just under the Clydesdale statue, at the 
Anheuser-Busch distribution center, and they were milling about in the busches (ha, ha!). Finally, a mark was found 
leading back to the river, and to the Beer Check, under the Rt 37 (East) bridge. The beer was opened. A few songs were 
sung, mostly to take advantage of the under-bridge acoustics. <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font>, dressed in six layers, 
complained that the mosquitoes were getting to him. <font color="#FF0000">Fuwangi</font>, still dizzy fro his head injury, 
re-sprained his ankle. The whining proved too much! They headed out.</p>

<p>The trail continued north under the separate Rt 37 (West) bridge. They came out of the shiggy onto Worthington Rd. A 
check was easily mastered, and <font color="#FF0000">WHO</font> led northwest on Pettaconsett to Pontiac. They crossed and 
ran through a seires of fastfood drive-throughs onto Sockanosett Cross Rd. A small amount of confusion, and they were back 
on abandoned railroad tracks turning southwest. Guess what? Another tunnel under Rt 37! This one was lovely, with no 
moisture, few invasive plants, attractive graffiti, and large amounts of broken glass. A brief run on the old railroad 
ties, then back out to Power.</p>

<p>Trail now meandered on unexceptional pavement southwest to Howard and then northwest back to the cars. Waiting for them 
at the cars: <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>. And the police. The young policeman had been lying in wait, hoping to 
make a name for himself by stopping Rhode Island’s first major prison escape. It was all too clear that this group didn’t 
fit the profile. He wracked his brain, trying to think of a reason to arrest them all. But finally he let them go, with a 
warning.</p>

<p>Because of the interruptions, it was decided to circle at the On On On. The hare recommended the famous “Billy’s 
Frosted Mug” (See run <a href="hhh819.html">#819</a>). They drove as a group into Cranston, and circled up in the rear 
parking lot. Ratings for the run reflected the excessive pavement, unnecessary shiggy, redundant tunnels, and lack of 
women in prison. But what put it firmly over the edge was the lack of arrests. Total: <b>-6.9</b?>! Hashit was variously 
given to <font color="#FF0000">Dry Foot</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Basket</font>, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font>, 
and ultimately <font color="#FF0000">Tinker</font>. But no one really cares anymore, without a physical hashit to award. 
At any rate, they moved into the restaurant. They feasted on RI classics: NY System-style wieners, and snail salad. The 
jukebox was cranking, so their singing was ineffective. But at least they weren’t thrown out.</p>
