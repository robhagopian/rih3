An unusual day for the RIH3, this 'first ever' Tuesday event, due to Monday being Christmas, the few that showed up were treated to a hot belly warmer of Gloog, made by hisself to begin this cold winter's Hash.  The trail led down behind the Administration building and then left along the old rail bed. After a short distance, trail went right towards the river, crossing the bridge and making its way over the swamp. The trail continued along the river to the end then left again on the rail bed to the beer stop. Revival You Thirsty, orange food and a gift wrapped box of candy was found under the smallest XMas tree ever. There were only 3 balls and some garland, but it was perfect for this small, but enthusiastic pack. A few songs were song and beer enjoyed, the we started out towards the cars. The circle again enjoyed the same beer and Just Pat was given the Hashit for no apparent reason. We then went to Gators Pub for more been and food. The run was rated a positive Zero.
