A short, important story.<br/>
(Author: Shemale)<br/><br/>

 

On Monday a Donkey was setting his beer stop and fell down into a well. The Donkey cried piteously. On On! On On! Eventually the RIH3 kennel came across his faint voice finding him at the bottom of the well. For hours the RIH3 tried to figure out what to do while singing and indulging in the hares wonderful selection of craft brews. Finally Basket decided the Donkey was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.

<br/><br/>He invited Dr. Who, Bondo, Buddy, Rusty, She male Man and Ozzing to help him. Wipos watched from afar. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the Donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Are you! Are You! Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down.

<br/><br/>A few shovel loads later, Basket finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the Donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.

<br/><br/>As Basket, Dr. Who, Bondo, Buddy, Rusty, She male Man and Ozzing continued to shovel dirt on top of the Donkey, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the Donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off to the cars, only to find Bares All (Don’t remember her name) waiting alone in the dark!

<br/><br/>Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping-stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!

<br/><br/>Remember the five simple rules to be happy:<br/>

- Avoid the RIH3 at all expense
- Ignore everything Basket does and says
- Also ignore everything Shemaleman does and says
- Drink more
- Expect less
