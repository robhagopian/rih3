<font color="#0000ff">The Run</font>:</p>

<p>I missed the start due to misquiding on Route 95 but I heard there were 2 beer checks and dry land ahead (both lies).
<br><br>

As I made my way through the paths of swampland and enjoyed the dense forest {as well as the company of the knight who 
waited for me this week} (due to two weeks in a row that the rest of the pack tried to lose me) I pondered that it all 
looked so familiar. &nbsp;Had we been here before? &nbsp;How many times before? If the only bimbo can recognize trees 
and paths this must be a re-hash? &nbsp;Could it be? &nbsp;Would <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> be so naive??<br><br>

I (and the knight) heard the sound of <font color="#FF0000">Basket's</font> shell horn (his large horn is lost in 
Canada...do you think anyone or any woman misses it??). &nbsp;Then the familiar yellow jacket was noticed in the swamp, 
there was <font color="#FF0000">Async</font> in a canoe with cans of Guinness. &nbsp;Not bad for a rehash, actually a 
nice touch... It felt like downtown Providence, the downtown Providence that good ole' Buddy has created with the boats 
in the river. &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Async</font> stood in his canoe, with a large stick guiding his way through 
the thickets to the other side of the water, you could see the glimmer in his eye as he dreamed of a new profession, 
wearing the red beret, gliding and guiding through the water as they do in Italy.........or downtown in the clean 
river........ <br><br>

As he guided his canoe, he told us stories of the rest of the pack. &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Dr. Who</font> had been 
praying to the beer Gods on his knees in the swamp. &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Raging Queen</font> had just told <font 
color="#FF0000">Dr. Who</font> there was Guinness at the beer check not Budweiser, so he was giving thanks (or sinking 
in the mud and muck, we are not sure). <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> thought he could find a short cut but never 
made it, and at the end realized the beer was 100 feet from the cars. &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
stayed dry until his final fall with Baxter in tow, proudly showing off his sunburned Mexican legs to the thirsty ticks 
within the swampland.<br><br>

Then there was the circle...The circle was enjoyed with singing and as usual, male domination. &nbsp;The whining started 
after <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> left the cirlcle early in a sprint. &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> 
and <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> were concerned about his patients, <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font>  
knew he was not that dedicated, he had forgetten the Hashit (once again) and was sprinting to retrieve it. &nbsp;When he 
returned, <font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> played with his whistle and while they enjoyed themselves, <font 
color="#FF0000">Kneeling Room Only</font> scored the run a + 6.9.<br><br>

<font color="#FF0000">Bondo</font> took <font color="#FF0000">Oozing's'</font> whistle out of his lips long enough to 
give it a 10F rating and <font color="#FF0000">Ever Ready</font> and <font color="#FF0000">WIPOS</font> both agreed to 
wetness on trail. &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">Basket</font> commented on the rehash offence and <font color="#FF0000">
Async</font> was given the appropriate down downs.<br><br>

As much whining and accusations as he could think of, it didn't work, <font color="#FF0000">Oozing</font> was once 
again awarded the Hashit and given the appropriate down down on his knees.<br><br>

The On In was a re-hash event at Marks (where everyone knows our names). &nbsp;The bartender was even looking for <font 
color="#FF0000">Raging Queen</font> and his bunny ears!<br><br>

It's time to find a new hash bar or maybe spend some time in other parts of our big state.... <br><br>
