<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This was by far the shortest run in RIH3 history,
where you could see the beginning from the end and your new GM, Scribe,
Hon Sec and any other job you want me to do took command of the situation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendees on this fine evening included </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Itchy

and yours truly. The venue was in North Attleboro on this nice evening
in what is known as WW1 Memorial Park, the only items worthy of mention
were the two peacocks and the prick that set this incredible short run.
&nbsp;&nbsp;A high point was when your scribe led the pack for all of two
minutes with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Basket </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">trying
to sodermise the new GM, maybe it was not two minutes as it was about this
time we hit the beer check, with everybody still not even reaching for
breath or reaching! At first it was considered a false mark with everybody
scattering to find the trail, but it was in fact the beer stop, had everybody
taken a short cut? Beer consumed a few songs we all set off thinking this
was going to be a long on in, but we were all back inside 40 minutes which
included a 10 minute beer stop. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Async</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> again got lost,
his eyes really do need a check! although he had the best workout of the
evening. Lime was used in copious amounts and although enough was laid
for a marathon a minithon was all it was. We were a little short on Grog
and for spilling some on a down down </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Oozing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was awarded the Hashshit. Marks for the run matched the course-small. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Itchy

to set the trail for the mentally disabled. The on-on was a local drinking
establishment which served good food and grog, good time was had by all,
good job </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Itchy Bro</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
especially as I did not come in last just for once.</FONT></P>
