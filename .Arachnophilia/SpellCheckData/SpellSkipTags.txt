;
; This is a list of HTML tags that should not be
; scanned by the spell checker.
;
; This list is used to prevent the spell checker from 
; scanning within the listed tags. The spell checker just skips the
; entire block enclosed by these tags.
;
; This list contains the (bare) tag to look for and the special closing tag
; to search for at the finish of the special block, the pair separated by a tab.
; The starting tag is bare, but the ending tag must be complete, because
; it can take different forms in different cases.
;
; If more tags are needed, just add them. In particular, if the spell checker
; scans within a tag pair that does not contain regular text, simply add the tag
; and its closing partner to this list, and the problem will go away.
;
; If you want to experiment, but not permanently delete a tag from this list,
; just "comment it out" -- place a comment delimiter ';'
; at the left margin. That way, you can restore the tag later.
