1.a. From the north, I 95 south to Rte 4, to North
Kingstown (exit 9, announced by five miles of huge
signs erected at great expense for this event), zero
odometer as you exit.<br><br>

1.b. From the south, I 95 north to Rte 102 south exit.
(You’ll be driving east on 102.) Drive about 9 miles
to the Rte 4 lights by Home Depot and skip to Step 3
of these misdirections.<br><br>

2. Continue 6.3 miles south to Rte 102 to Wickford
(exit 5A).<br><br>

3 Drive east (or south as you might notice the road
signs suggesting) for 2.5 miles to intersection with
Rte 1 (Post Road; traffic lights).<br><br>

4. Turn right at intersection, and proceed south on
Rte 1 for 0.4 miles to the Oak Hill Tavern on your
right. Park at the end of the car park to the left of
the Tavern. <br><br>

5. Short shiggy-free run begins at 6:30 pm sharp.
Brief beer stop (shit beer). Gotta be back in time for
the steak barbie, $10/ head. (WHO said “head”?)<br>
