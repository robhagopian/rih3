195 East through Fall River to 24 South<br><br>

24 South across the bridge into Portsmouth (on the ISLAND)<br><br>

Take Exit for 138 South (“138 South, Middletown, Newport Beaches”)<br><br>

At end of Exit Ramp, Turn Right<br><br>

In about a half mile, turn Right to continue on 138 (at Clements Market, and CVS)<br><br>

In 3 miles, there is a stoplight. Stop if it’s red.<br><br>

Just past the stoplight there is a State Police Barracks. Don’t speed here.<br><br>

Go 0.3 miles past the stoplight and turn Left into Glen Farm/Gardener-Severny Sports Complex. (It will be dark. It will be 
poorly marked. But it is just past a cemetery, and across from a housing development. You can do it!)<br><br>

Sojurn down the tree-lined lane, take a quick zig-zag past the “Leonard Brown House (under development) and look for the 
sign for parking on the Left opposite the Polo Fields.<br><br>
