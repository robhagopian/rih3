What to bring???<br>
· Bathing Suit for our Heated Outdoor Pool fun so stop in early and enjoy the festivities (read beer)
(sorry but no nudity, as there may be children that haven’t seen your little peepees)<br>
· Shiggy Shoes, you wouldn’t be happy without getting shite up you tush would you?<br>
· Towel, guess why? You’ll be crying with joy afterward.<br>
· An original song for the circle. Even WIPOS has tried his best at one or two.<br>
· Your favorite concubine (to entertain the Hare afterward)<br>
· Happy Faces, Basket is the Hare…Hip, Hip Harrah, Hip, Hip Harrah, Hip, Hip Harrah<br><br>

How to get there: EFFINS is opposite Woonasquatucket Reservoir (Stump Pond for you WANKS) just before Box Seats most of 
you should know where that is.<br><br>

For the others:<br>
From Rte 295 to exit 8 and go north on Rte 7 towards Bryant U at the intersection at 116, go left (south) on Rte 116 to 
the stop sign and right (north on Rte 5) for about half a mile to Effins on the right.<Br><Br>
From Rte 146 or Mendon Rd, go south on 116 in Cumberland and straight past Rte 7 to the “T” intersection with Rte 5, then 
right. If all else fails, call your mother and tell her I said “Hello”.<br><br>
