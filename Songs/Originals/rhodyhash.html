<p>We are from Rhody, good hash are we.<br>
We take great pride in our shiggy.<br>
We swear on our soul, <br>
it’s as deep as your asshole,</p>

<p>For we’re from the Rhody Hash.<br>
Up hash, up hash, up hash<br>
Right on hash.<br>
La, la, la, la, la, la, la la la<br>
La, la, la, la, la, la, la la la</p>

<p>Ever Ready’s an eager beaver bitch<br>
She such a teaser, she makes our penis twitch.<br>
But she’s going up to Boston,<br>
Now she’s got a cunt you could get lost in.</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Bondo Jovi, he makes us beer,<br>
But don’t drink too many, it’ll make you queer.<br>
One or two at night, <br>
Will make you feel just right.</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Man of steel WIPOS, he’s got great clothes<br>
Plenty of protection, as everybody knows.<br>
But if you bend over too quick,<br>
He’ll stick up his walking stick,</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>As psycologist go, Oozing’s the best,<br>
Once on his coutch, he’ll put you to rest.<br>
You’ll be fucked, with your weakened will<br>
But just wait till you get his bill.</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Dr, WHO,  he sings his song.<br>
“Asshole’s are free today”, how could you go wrong?<br>
But his scapel is sharp and quick,<br>
He could slip and cut your dick.</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>When Basket hashes, he keeps one eye on the ground<br>
You know he’s behind you, when you here this sound.<br>
“Jesus Christ, what the fuck, why<br>
Did I just step on my eye?”</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Our webmaster, Async’s the bugger<br>
Tuesday morning he pulls out his lugger.<br>
His wife, Mr. Spock, <br>
Tells him to stick it in his sock.</p>
