<p>On an early Monday evening, the hash got together<br>
Meeting at the Bernon Heights Elementary School<br>
The sun had left us early, so we all had our torches<br>
The temperature was dropping, getting kind of cool.</p>

<p>Fuwangii was our hare, and that made us all worried.<br>
You could never tell, what he was thinking ‘tween those ears.<br>
So if you don’t mind me sayin’, we weren’t in no hurry.<br>
We all enjoyed one more round of Bondo Beer.</p>

<p>Fuwangii complained, so we drank our last swallow.<br>
Started out of the parking lot, turning on our lights<br>
As we ran down Bernon Street, everyone one was quiet.<br>
We all hoped this wanker hare, finally got it right.</p>

<p>You got to know when to hide, know when to get down.<br>
Know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
You must enjoy your beer as if it’s your last one.<br>
If you’re late to the circle, the beer may be gone.</p>

<p>Now every hasher knows, to keep lights off at the beer stop.<br>
Excepting Bondo, who was flashing out to the street.<br>
Well we first heard one siren, and soon we heard another.<br>
Fuwangii hollered, “run!”, so we all moved our feet.</p>

<p>The cop moved his search light, in the woods where we all hid.<br>
Everyone was quiet, except that barking Ben<br>
And somewhere in the darkness, Bondo had to give up<br>
But first he hollered out, “don’t shoot me, I’m comin’ in.</p>

<p>Well the cop had his pistol, pointed right at Bondo<br>
His hand was shakin’ as he hadn’t yet shot no one.<br>
Bondo held both his hands high above his head light.<br>
“There’s no need for shootin’, I confess what I’ve done.”</p>

<p>You got to know when to hide, know when to get down,<br>
Know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
You must enjoy your beer as if it’s your last one.<br>
If you’re late to the circle, the beer may be gone.</p>

<p>The cop put Bondo in handcuffs; his wrists behind his back.<br>
Then shoved him in the back seat, so he would not run away.<br>
One by one the hash came out of their hiding.<br>
The Woonsocket Police had caught them, now they had to pay.</p>

<p>Back-up showed up shortly, and cornered all the wankers.<br>
Asked for their names, birth date and where they were from.<br>
One cop looked at Tinker, and he started laughin’.<br>
You’re as old as my grandfather, how the hell can you run.</p>

<p>Well Basket wasn’t with them, but they saw him with Seamus,<br>
Out on Manville Road, running along the street.<br>
He was the only smart one, ‘cause he refused to give up.<br>
So let those other wankers, go and beat their meat.</p>

<p>You got to know when to hide, know when to get down,<br>
Know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
You must enjoy your beer as if it’s your last one.<br>
If you’re late to the circle, the beer may be gone.</p>

<p>Trail Hoover and Oozing, were listening to the Red Sox<br>
The cops didn’t mind that they had their ear phones on.<br>
But Async was worried, he needed his employment,<br>
’cause the way he spends his money, soon it’ll be gone.</p>

<p>Dr WHO and Flounder, they looked kinda puzzled.<br>
They didn’t know what to make of all this fuss.<br>
One minute they were hashing; enjoying a beer,<br>
And now they are busted with Bondo’s in a truss.</p>

<p>Now every Hasher knows Fuwangii can’t be trusted,<br>
To set a trail that won’t put them in jail.<br>
So on Monday night, when he’s next the hare,<br>
Let’s go somewhere else, and run our own trail.</p>

<p>You got to know when to hide, know when to get down.<br>
Know when to walk away and know when to run.<br>
You must enjoy your beer as if it’s your last one.<br>
If you’re late to the circle, the beer may be gone.</p>
