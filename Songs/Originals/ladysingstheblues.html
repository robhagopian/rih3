<p><b>AIN'T MISBEHAVIN' (I'M SAVIN' MY BEER FOR ME)</b><br>
Thomas Waller / Harry Brooks / Andy Razaf</b>

<p>No one to talk with, all by myself<br>
No one to drink with, but I'm happy on the shelf<br>
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my beer for me.</p>

<p>I know for certain the beer I love<br>
I'm through with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of<br>
Ain't Antisocial, I'm savin' my beer for me.</p>

<p>Like Jack Horner in the corner<br>
don't go nowhere, what do I care<br>
Your taste is worth waitin' for . . . Believe me.</p>

<p>I don't stay out late, it may sound queer.<br>
I'm home about 8, just me and my favorite beer.<br>
Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my beer for me.</p>


<p><b><br>RUNNING THE HASH AGAIN</b><br>
Sung to tune of Falling in Love Again<br>
F. Hollander / S. Lerner </p>

<p>Running the hash again<br>
Never wanted to<br>
What am I to do?<br>
Can't help it</p>

<p>Hashin's always been my game<br>
Play it as I may<br>
I was born that way<br>
Can't help it</p>

<p>Bimbos flock around me<br>
Like moths around a flame<br>
And if their wings burn<br>
I know I'm not to blame</p>

<p>I'm HASHIN’<br>
Can't help it</p>

<p><b><br>GOD BLESS THE HASHER</b><br>
Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog Jr. </p>

<p>Them that's fast shall get<br>
Them that's not shall lose<br>
The Hash Bible said and it still is news<br>
Mama may have, Papa may have<br>
But God bless the hasher that's got his own<br>
That's got his own beer.</p>

<p>Yes, the FRB’s gets more<br>
While the DFL ones fade<br>
Wankers don't ever make the grade<br>
Mama may have, Papa may have<br>
But God bless the hasher that's got his own<br>
That's got his own beer.</p>

<p>Beer Keg, you've got lots of friends<br>
Crowding round the door<br>
When you're gone, drinkin’ ends<br>
They don't come no more<br>
Other hashers give<br>
Crap beer and such<br>
You can help yourself<br>
But don't take too much<br>
Mama may have, Papa may have<br>
But God bless the hasher that's got his own<br>
That's got his own beer.</p>

<p>Mama may have, Papa may have<br>
But God bless the hasher that's got his own<br>
That's got his own<br>
He just worry 'bout nothin'<br>
Cause he's got his own beer.</p>


<p><b><br>I COVER THE WATERFRONT</b><br>
Johnny W. Green / Edward Heyman</p>

<p>Away from the city that hurts and knocks,<br>
I'm standing alone by the desolate docks<br>
in the still and the chill of the night<br>
I see the horizon the great unknown<br>
my heart has an ache<br>
it's as heavy as stone<br>
with the dawn coming on, make it last</p>

<p>I cover the waterfront<br>
I'm lookin’ for flour<br>
Will the beer I love<br>
Be found this hour</p>

<p>I cover the waterfront<br>
In search of my beer <br>
An I'm covered<br>
By the shaggy that’s dear</p>

<p>Here am I<br>
Patiently waiting<br>
Hoping and longing<br>
Oh how I yearn<br>
Where are you<br>
Have you thought back time<br>
Will you remember<br>
Will you return</p>

<p>Will the beer I love<br>
Be coming back<br>
To me</p>


<p><b><br>I GOTTA RIGHT TO SING THE BLUES</b><br>
Harold Arlen / Ted Koehler </p>

<p>I gotta right to sing the blues<br>
I gotta right to moan inside<br>
I gotta right to sit and cry<br>
Down around the river<br>
A certain man in this little town</p>

<p>Keeps draggin' my poor heart around<br>
All I see for me is misery</p>

<p>I gotta right to sing the blues<br>
I gotta right to moan inside<br>
I gotta right to sit and cry<br>
Down around the river<br>
A certain man in this little town</p>

<p>Soon that deep blue sea<br>
Will be callin' me<br>
It must be love say what you choose<br>
I gotta right to sing the blues<br>
I gotta right to sing the blues</p>

<p>I gotta right to moan and cry<br>
I gotta sit and sigh</p>

<p>Down around the river<br>
Soon that deep blue sea<br>
Will be callin' me</p>

<p>It must be love say what you choose<br>
I gotta right to sing the blues</p>

<p>There's nothing left for me<br>
I'm full of misery<br>
I gotta right to sing the blues</p>

<p><b><br>GOOD MORNING HEADACHE</b><br>
Irene Higginbotham / Ervin Drake / Dan Fisher </p>

<p>Good morning headache<br>
Please don’t speak<br>
Good morning heartache<br>
Thought we said goodbye last week<br>
I Hashed and Drank all night long.<br>
But here you are with the dawn<br>
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay<br>
It seems I met you<br>
When my beer went away<br>
Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you<br>
Good morning headache what's new</p>

<p>Stop haunting me now<br>
Can't shake you no how<br>
Just leave me alone<br>
I've got Hash Monday blues<br>
Straight to Sunday blues<br>
Good morning headache<br>
Here we go again<br>
Good morning headache<br>
You're the one<br>
Who knows me well<br>
Might as well get use to you hanging around<br>
Good morning headache<br>
Sit down</p>

<p><b><br>MY BROWN TO YOU</b><br>
Leo Robin / Richard Whiting / Ralph Rainger </p>

<p>Who do you think is comin' to town<br>
You'll never guess who<br>
Lovable, hugable Basket’s Brown<br>
My Brown to you<br>
What if the rain comes pattering down<br>
My heaven is blue<br>
Can it be sending me Basket’s Brown<br>
My Brown to you<br>
I know her eyes will thrill ya<br>
But go slow, oh, oh<br>
Don't you all get too familiar<br>
Why do you think she's comin' to town<br>
Just wait and you'll see<br>
The lovable little Basket’s Brown to you<br>
Is baby to me, yes, yes<br>
Mark it down</p>

<p><b><br>THESE FOOLISH THINGS</b><br>
Jack Strachey / Harry Link / Holt Marvell / Eric Maschwitz </p>

<p>Lipstick's traces on an old French letter.<br>
A case of you know what, that won’t get better.<br>
Oh how my foreskin stings.<br>
These foolish things remind me of you.</p>

<p>And when I awoke upon the morning after.<br>
I saw your tits and and wet my self with laughter.<br>
Oh how that left one swings.<br>
These foolish thing remind me of you.</p>

<p>A tampon floating in a toilet bowl.<br>
A pubic hair on a breakfast roll.<br>
The bed with squeaking spring. <br>
These foolish thing remind me of you.</p>
