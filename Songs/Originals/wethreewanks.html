<p>Getting older sure is a drag<br>
Change in bowels is one red flag<br>
Take no chance, or<br>
Rectal cancer<br>
Might just buy you the "bag."</p>

<p>Oh-Oh-O!</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Time for colonoscopy<br>
For old men in the RIH3<br>
Cleanse your bowels<br>
Stop your howls<br>
Dr WHO says it’s pain-free</p>

<p><br>Basket first, he’s got no class<br>
Fake tatoos all over his ass<br>
Always joking<br>
Through the poking<br>
Saving up all his gas</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Bondo’s next, he made his bowels clear<br>
On the bed, presented his rear<br>
This exposure<br>
Caused discomposure<br>
The nurses went white with fear</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Tinker’s last, the favorite hash gimp<br>
Got prepared in spite of his limp<br>
Watched, breath bated<br>
Unsedated<br>
Proving that he’s no wimp</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>Async’s next, his time is near due</p>
He has said he’ll chose Dr WHO<br>
He may rue it<br>
But WHO will do it<br>
Problem is: who will do WHO?</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>
