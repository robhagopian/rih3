<p>Oh Doctor WHO, my pipes, my pipes are failing.<br>
And from my ass there's leaking a green goo.<br>
Runs down my cheeks and legs and in my stocking,<br>
Fairly soon, it will fill my shoe.</p>

<p>I haven't had a stiffy in a long time<br>
And now my wife is demanding a screw,<br>
She said if I could not get it up again,<br>
I'd have to move in with someone like you.</p>

<p>And if you come, and take me to your hospital<br>
And place my body in your operating room<br>
I'll see the light, so bright above me<br>
And I will know that I'll be better soon.</p>

<p>And I shall hear, you softly work above me<br>
And your sweet voice will warmer softly cry,<br>
It's Monday night the Hash Horn is calling<br>
So I must go and leave this Wanker die.</p>

<p>I'll simply Hash, and leave this Wanker die.</p>
