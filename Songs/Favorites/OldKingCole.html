OLD KING COLE<br>
Old King Cole was a bugger for the hole,<br>
And a bugger for the hole was he.<br>
He called for his wife in the middle of the night,<br>
And he called for his fiddlers three.<br><br>

Now every fiddler had a very fine fiddle,<br>
And a very fine fiddle had he.<br>
Fiddle-diddle dee, diddle dee, said the fiddlers,<br>
Merry, merry men are we.<br>
There's none so fair as can compare,<br>
With the boys from the HHH.<br><br>
