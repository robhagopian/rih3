THESE FOOLISH THINGS<br>
A pair of boobies in a loose brassiere,<br>
A cunt that twitches like a moose's ear,<br>
A dirty rubber in my glass of beer,<br>
Chorus: These foolish things remind me of you.<br><br>

Those bloodstained knickers in a London taxi,<br>
Strange noises from a horses jaxie,<br>
The night you aborted twins./Your little hairy quim.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

Lipstick traces on an old french letter,<br>
Attacks of syphilis that won't get better,<br>
And when I piss it stings.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

A running sore beside an open hole,<br>
A kotex floating in my toilet bowl,<br>
A pubic hair on my breakfast roll.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

When I awoke upon the morning after,<br>
I saw your tits and pissed myself with laughter,<br>
Oh how the left one swings.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

The birth control book with it's well worn pages,<br>
The contraceptive that comes off in stages,<br>
Oh how my foreskin stings.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

Sex education with old Sister Mary,<br>
Abusing turkeys in the aviary,<br>
Oh how those birds could sing.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

Blood stains on the sheet that soap can't shift,<br>
Frozen dog turds in a deep snow drift,<br>
And when it comes to spring.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

The leather sofa where we used to linger,<br>
The quim juice running down my middle finger,<br>
And those squeaky springs.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

The old settee we used to lie and grunt on,<br>
The piece of rag you used to wipe your cunt on,<br>
How the aroma clings.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

The motel room we used to hug and kiss in,<br>
The flower pot you used to squat and piss in,<br>
There'll be no flowers next spring.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

The newsboy calling out the late night final,<br>
Those girlish screams from in the gents urinal,<br>
Sometimes I think my crabs have wings.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

Your legs wrapped round me in a wild contortion,<br>
The rusty tongs we used for your abortion,<br>
A big, fat, flabby minge.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

Those handcuffs dangling beside the bed,<br>
Teeth marks on my dong after you gave me head,<br>
A banana sticking in your quim.<br>
Chorus:<br><br>

A mini-minor with the seats pushed forward,<br>
That little bunk-up that is oh so awkward,<br>
The way we shook its springs.<br>
Chorus:
