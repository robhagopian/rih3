I WENT DOWN TO THE LOCAL INFIRMARY OR THE TIRD HASH
To the tune of St James Infirmary

[Chorus]
I went down to the local infirmary
To get my brain scan read
They said if you run with Rhode Island
We’re afraid your brain may be dead

[Verse]
I ran the Rhody Hash on Monday
To meet with some wankers there,
The usual crowd was assembled
The Tird in the Beaver was Hare

He was standing in the circle
His eyes were bloodshot red,
He turned to the Hash around him
These are the very words he said

It rained like hell all weekend
The flour just washed away,
You’ll be lucky to find any trail
You’re pretty well fucked, I’d say

The Hash paid little attention
They were off to find some beer
They search this wide world over,
It was never found, not even near

After hours of running in circles,
They finally said fuck this shit
They walked back to they’re cars, 
Disappointed, in a raging fit.

So listen to my warning
If ever the Tird is Hare
Take that Monday off from Hashing
Or let the Hasher beware

[Chorus]
I went down to the local infirmary
To get my brain scan read
They said if you run with Rhode Island
We’re afraid your brain may be dead
