YELLOW IS THE COLOR
Melody: Yellow is the Color

Yellow is the color that makes me go,
When I'm hashin', a-a hum, when I'm hashin' it makes me go,
And it's the color of my name spelled in the snow.

Red is the color of the setting sky,
When I'm hashin', ah-humm, when I'm hashin', the setting sky,
And it's the color of my foreskin caught in my fly.

Orange is the color that brings me cheer,
When I'm hashin', ah-humm, when I'm hashin', it brings me cheer,
And it's the color of the carrots in my beer.

Green is the color of all that grows,
When I'm hashin', ah-humm, when I'm hashin', of all that grows,
And it's the color of the boogers up my nose.

Brown is the color that makes me dance,
When I'm hashin', ah-humm, when I'm hashin', it makes me dance,
And it's the color of my true love's underpants.

Blue is the color that makes me stop,
When I'm hashin', ah-humm, when I'm hashin, it makes me stop,
And it's the color of the vein in my pork chop.

White is the color of the winter snows,
When I'm hashin', ah-humm, when I'm hashin', the winter snows,
And it's the color of the cheese between my toes.
