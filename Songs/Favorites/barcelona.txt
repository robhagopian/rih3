Barcelona

Tune: Mañana

CHORUS: 
Mañana, mañana,
Is my banana good enough for you?

Way down in Barcelona, 
Where ladies learn to knit,
A lady stuck a knitting needle in another lady's tit.
Said the lady to the lady, 
"We're here to learn to knit,
Not to stick a knitting needle in another lady's tit."

Way down in Barcelona, 
Where drummers play the drum,
A drummer stuck a drumstick up another drummer's bum.
Said the drummer to the drummer, 
"We're here to play the drum, 
Not stick a drumstick up another drummer's bum."

Way down in Barcelona, 
Where lepers decompose,
A leper picked a snotty from another leper's nose.
Said the leper to the leper,
"We're here to decompose,
Not to pick a snotty from another leper's nose."

Way down in Barcelona, 
Where ladies learn to swim,
A lady put her finger up another lady's quim.
Said the lady to the lady, 
"We're here to learn to swim,
Not to put our fingers up another lady's quim."

Way down in Barcelona, 
Where beggars beg for food,
A beggar chucked a lunger in another beggar's gruel.
Said the beggar to the beggar,
"We're here to beg for food,
Not to chuck a lunger in another beggar's gruel."

Way down in Barcelona, 
Where wankers yank their crank,
A wanker took a yank of another wanker's crank.
Said the wanker to the wanker,
"We're here to yank our crank,
Not to yank a crank off another wanker's crank."

Way down in Barcelona where the miners shovel coal,
A miner shoved a shovel up another miners hole,
Said the miner to the miner,
We're here to shovel coal,
And not to shove a shovel up another miners hole.

Way down in New York City,
Where the cabbies drive so fast.
A cabby rammed his cab up another cabbies ass,
Said the cabby to the cabby,
(Wind down window)
FUCK YOU - BUDDY!
