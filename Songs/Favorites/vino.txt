Give Me That Good Old Vino

Tune: Frito Bandito

 

I like my gin - it helps me get in,
But give me that good old vino.
I like my vino,
It gives me a schwing supremo.

CHORUS:
Aye-yi-yi-yi,
Si, si signora.
My sister Belinda she pissed out the window
And filled up my brand new sombrero.

I like my brandy - it makes me feel randy,
But give me that good old vino...(CHORUS)
I like my stout - it helps me get out,
But give me that good old vino...(CHORUS)
I like my rum - it helps me to cum,
But give me that good old vino...(CHORUS)
I like my beer - it helps cure gonorrhea,
But give me that good old vino...(CHORUS)
I like my liquor - it makes me cum quicker,
But give me that good old vino...(CHORUS)
