I've Only Half a Brain

Tune: If I Only Had a Brain (From Wizard of OZ)

 

I could while away the hours 
Searchin' hills for flour 
Across a wide terrain. 
I'd be chipper, and I'd be cheerful 
If my stomach had a beerful 
'Cause I've only half a brain.

With my arms and legs akimbo 
I'll be chasing after bimbos 
Through mud thorns and rain. 
I'll be making lots of passes 
As I fondle all their asses 
'Cause I've only half a brain.

CHORUS: 
I'll do down-downs till the keg begins to spit 
Then I'll fire one up and take a little hit 
I'll impress the women with my charming wit 
As I shout out, "Show us your tits!"

Then my beer I will be sharing 
With them as their breast they're baring 
Our urges unrestrained 
Oh, our language will be rude as 
We exchange bod-i-ly fluids 
'Cause we've only half a brain.
