Junior Birdmen

Tune: Chenango Forks

 

Up in the air Junior birdmen.
Into the air upside down.
Up into the air junior birdmen,
With your noses to the ground.

And when you hear the grand announcement,
That your wings are made of tin,
Then you will know Junior Birdmen have sent their boxtops in.

For it takes five boxtops,
Four bottle-bottoms
Three wrappers,
Two labels,
And one thin dime ...
Ratta...ta...ta...a...a...a....
