The Lehigh Valley

Tune: Red River Valley

 

Don't look at me that way, stranger, 
I didn't shit in your seat. 
I just come down from the mountains 
With my balls all covered with sleet.

I've been up in the Lehigh Valley, 
Me and my old pal, Lou, 
A-pimpin' for a whorehouse 
And a God damned good one too.

It was there that I first fucked Nellie; 
She was the village belle. 
I was only a lowdown panderer 
But I loved that girl like hell.

But along came a city slicker, 
All handsome, gay and rich, 
And he stole away my Nellie, 
That stinking son-of-a-bitch.

I'm just restin' my ass a moment, 
And then I'm on my way. 
I'll hunt the runt that swiped my cunt 
If it takes till Judgement Day
