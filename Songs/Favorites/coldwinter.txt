Cold Winter's Evening

Tune: She Was Just a Poor Man's Daughter

'Twas a cold winter's evening
The guests were all leavin'
O'Leary was closin' the bar
When he turned and he said
To the lady in red
"Get out! You can't stay where you are."

Oh she wept a sad tear
In her bucket of beer
As she thought of the cold night ahead,
When a gentleman dapper
Stepped out of the crapper
And these are the words that he said:

"Her mother never taught her
The things a young girl should know
About the ways of college men
And how they come and go (Mostly go-)
Age has stolen her beauty,
And sin has left its sad scar (You know where-)
So remember your mothers and sisters, boys,
And let her sleep under the bar."
(With old granddad)
