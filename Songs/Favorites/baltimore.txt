Girl From Baltimore

Tune: ???

 

Oh she went to the church just to pray for the people,
But the funk of her cunt knocked the cross off the steeple.

CHORUS: 
She's a dirty motherfucker,
She's a rotten whore,
She's the girl from Baltimore
(or Waukesha or Singapore)
What did the Hasher say?
Bum titty-bum titty-bum titty-bum,
Titty-bum titty-bum titty-bum titty-bum.

Oh she went to the well just to make a wish,
But the funk of her cunt killed off all the fish.

Oh she went for a ride on her motorcycle,
But the funk of her cunt knocked the chain off the cycle.

She visited Jakarta on a medical trip,
But the funk of her cunt just continued to drip.

She laid a Wednesday run just for a caper,
Using the funk of her cunt instead of using paper.

She laid it round a . . . late one afternoon,
But the funk of her cunt knocked the star off the moon.

She took a short cut just to get back quicker,
But the funk of her cunt made the shiggy thicker.

She led them down a cliff just to test their reaction,
But the funk of her cunt made them lose all their traction.

They made her sing a song at the end of the day,
But the funk of her cunt made the circle go away.

At last she was a leaving and we gave her a mug,
But the funk of her cunt was enough to fill her jug.

I tried to eat her out, but I was appalled,
Cause the funk from her cunt made me go bald.

She went to the doctor to get the pill,
But the funk of her cunt made the doctor ill.

Well she went and shaved her beave,
But the funk of her cunt made her boyfriend heave.
Oh she ran down the tracks to shortcut the trail,

But the skunk from her cunt made the train derail.
