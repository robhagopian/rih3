DOS, A BEER

Melody – Do, Re, Mi (Sound of Music) 

Dos, a beer, a Mexican beer, 
Ray, the guy who buys me beer, (Thanks Ray!), 
Me, the guy, he buys beer for, 
Far, a long-long way to run, 
So, I think I’ve have a beer! 
La, la la la la la la, 
Tea, no thanks I’ll have a beer, 
And that brings us back to Dos, dos, dos, dos… 

Actions: During “La, la la la la la la”, some Hashers will dance in a small circle with their vessels above their cranium.
