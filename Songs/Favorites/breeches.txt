Inside Those Red Plush Breeches

Tune: ???

 

John Thomas was a servant tall
The pride and joy of the servant's hall,
Although he only had one ball,
Inside his red plush breeches.

CHORUS:
And he wore red plush breeches
And he wore red plush breeches
And he wore red plush breeches that kept John Thomas warm
CHORUS:
Out of all the servant's at the servant's post
Mary was the one he loved the most
And for her his ball would roast
Inside those red plush breeches
CHORUS:
They went for a walk one moonlight night
The stars were out and the moon was bright
Things became extremely tight
Inside those red plush breeches
CHORUS:
They found a stump to sit upon
They found a stack to lay upon
Next day Mary sewed buttons on
That pair of red plush breeches
CHORUS:
Mary had an illegit
It's face looked like a piece of shit
And every time she looked at it
She cursed those red plush breeches
CHORUS:
Now Mary laid poor John a trap,
And he fell for it like a sap,
And now he's got a dose of clap,
Inside those red plush breeches.
