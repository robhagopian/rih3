NELLIE 'AWKINS
Melody—She wore no trousers.

I first met Nellie 'awkins down the old Kent Road,
Her drawers were hanging down,
She'd just been with Charlie Brown.
I shoved a filthy tanner in her filthy rotten hand,
'Cause she was a dirty old whore,
Oh she wore no blouses,
And I wore no trousers,
And we both wore no underclothes.
When she caressed me,
She damn near undressed me,
What a pleasure, no man knows.
I went to the doctor--he said,
"Where did you knock her?"
I said, "Down where the green grass grows."
He said, "In less than a twinkle,
That pimple on your winkle,
Will be bigger than a big red rose."

How do I make my rhubarb rise,
Dada dada da da,
Oh my rhubarb refuses to rise
To its natural size,
Market gardenin' size,
Oh my rhubarb refuses to rise
'Cause my baby don't love me,
My baby don't love me,
Oh my baby don't love me no more.

A poke with a bloke may be quite incidental,
Durex is a girl's best friend.
You may get the works,
But you won't be parental
As he slides it in,
You trust that good old latex skin,
As he lets fly, none gets by,
Cause it's all gathered up in the end.
This little precaution
Avoids an abortion,
Durex is a girl's best friend.

I caught a dose of pox a year ago,
I thought it was the clap and it would go.
But the more I waited, the worse it grew,
Now I've got galloping knob rot.
What can I do?
The other day I lost my starboard ball,
And now the other one's begun to fall,
I'm wasting away, I'll be sorry someday,
'Cause then I'll have no balls at all.
